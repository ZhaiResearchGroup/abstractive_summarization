he's saying he's resigning, not because he's guilty, but because he can't be an effective senator for the people of minnesota while also dealing with the ethics investigation.
[~~livestream link~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n84ixmf2vto) e: ~~new livestream link~~ [video of his resignation speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyynq9skzw8) it doesn't matter anymore.
by resigning he is now guilty.
the only thing that will save him is some miraculous revelation that all his accusers were hired by project veritas, and the media does an about face and issues apologies which they will never do.
nope, the new innocent is to categorically deny, call the acussers liars, and ride out the storm.
not even just for government but for everything.
an accusation is the new guilty and denial and pr is the new innocent.
facts seemingly don't matter.
think of all the people in hollywood caught up in metoo.
the ones that dug in their heels and denied are doing much better than others.
this is like a recent episode of orville (although its season 1 so all are recent).
they don't get lawyers when arrested, they get pr reps. doesn't matter your guilt or innocence, matters how you sell yourself on your pr tour.
i watched that episode recently.
they would upvote and downvote people from their phones.
what a silly concept!
can we take a moment to talk about how great the orville is?
it’s like satire and homage rolled into one tasty ball.
this isn't new.
always been that way.
he did say he "crossed a line" so he's admitting to something.
he considers the picture from the original accusation, that showed mimed groping, to have been crossing a line, as it was in terrible taste.
thank you for being the one person to explicitly call it what it was, miming.
it infuriates me how many people call that a photo of groping.
you can clearly see the shadow of his hands and fingers on her body which basically proves there was no contact.
why can’t people comprehend this?
yes it was inappropriate and in bad taste but it is not even comparable to preying on 14 yr old girls.
just call it "sexual misconduct" so you can throw it all in the same sack.
i've even heard it referred to as sexual assault, actually (probably from the right to further disparage him.)
seems like a pretty big disservice to people who are actually assaulted.
it was a bad joke, but that's about it.
~~she was also conducting herself inappropriately around that time~~ she was also engaging in sexually charged behavior, which could easily lead to an atmosphere where he thought this sexual joke would be okay.
i haven't really liked franken since his state went to sanders and he still insisted he'd use his superdelegate for clinton.. but this particular instance is overblown.
edit : i am not victim shaming any one, nor did i say it excused his behavior.
everything has context however.
here is the woman he pretended to grope in the picture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjidgi-nmd0 again, this doesn't excuse his behavior.
but there is context to everything.
edit #2 : here she is on the same tour, pretending to hump robin williams and smack his ass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;v=gkeruf_hwlw also, she's contributed to sean hannity's show.. so take that for what you will.
did you watch full frontal yesterday?
sam bee has gone off the deep end.
she literally called any man that has misbehaved around women a sexual predator.
any misbehavior.
equating just being an asshole to a woman to rape.
i used to respect her.
that went away.
she's also against busing in lower income kids to her children's privilege school.
she's totally for busing in those kids to your children's school though.
http://www.slate.com/blogs/schooled/2016/06/17/the_upper_west_side_is_new_york_s_latest_school_integration_battleground.html fuckin nimby shitheads thinking they know what's best for everyone not in my back yard they won't!
thanks for saving me the trip to urbandictionary did you link to the wrong article?
that article is about moving an entire school that was originally opened to address overcrowding to another location, in order to address overcrowding.
jason jones, samantha bee's husband, is quoted only as saying that to pretend classism/racism is the only place that opposition to moving the school could come from is ridiculous.
the idea of whether samantha bee (or her husband for that matter) is for or against busing low income children to better schools doesn't come up.
and really, practically none of the information necessary to make an informed decision about what's best here is provided in that article or its sources.
perhaps i'm not reading it right, but it seems like they are opposed to moving the school's location 16 blocks away and not busing in new minority students.
those are two completely different issues.
that article quotes her husband not her.
they don’t necessarily have the same stance.
now, not saying anything about her stance is pretty damning when her husband has stated such a strong opinion but i wouldn’t put words in her mouth.
i had the same impression.
at one point in time, full frontal was funny, cutting, insightful commentary.
last night was crazytown.
i get that we're at a flashpoint with this stuff and emotions are running high, but last night's episode absolutely went off the deep end.
she had that montage of hillary bashing that conflated sexist criticism with legitimate criticism, which seemed to be making the dangerous and stupid point that "any criticism against a woman is inherently sexist" which i guess means we can't criticize women now?
is that where she wants this to land?
it was disturbing.
she did that during the 2016 primary too, bernie bros were no doubt obnoxious but bernie was extremely careful to not endorse sexism.
&gt; she was also conducting herself inappropriately around that time can you explain what this refers to, please?
"i hover handed some boobs in a staged photo" - franken it has to be done, but the democrats are ned stark-ing themselves.
robb starking* still too soon, rip to the true kingindanorf he should've honored the wedding arrangement.
that was a massive fuck up on his part :/ his fatal flaw was sending theon back to the iron islands.
the cascade of his downfall stemmed from there.
that was hard for him to forsee; he grew up with theon and never expected betrayal.
i agree to be sure, but i don't think anyone would have been able to make a better decision given the situation theon was an idiot though.
don't trust idiots to do important jobs.
true, but i don't think rob was actually expecting theon to deliver, and he was a nuisance on the field.
he also never even considered that he would switch sides.
mistakes all around, certainly.
unfortunately a lack of experience is what led to the mistake.
he didn't understand iron islanders can't be given a kingdom.
logically from a northern perspective it's an amazing deal for then to join robb but robb never fought them or alongside them(theon doesn't really count).
cat tried to convince robb not to send theon and he wouldn’t listen.
yep, he should have listened to her in more than one circumstance.
she warned him about betraying the fray's.
to be fair, she did somewhat discredit herself by releasing their valued prisoner (jamie) and weakening robb's strategic position.
and honestly, nobody was really expecting such a ancient, sacred guest-right truce to be violated like that.
no, if he lived that would have been a problem, but not a fatal flaw.
what really did robb stark in was executing the lord of half his military forces and then taking a piss on the head of the lord who commanded most of his allied forces.
his mother warned him he couldn't do that to walder frey, but honor(book) dictated it from his point of view.
theon's transgressions, horrible as they may be, were of far less importance than driving your largest ally into the arms of your enemies and causing half your standing army to desert overnight.
it wasn't even his own honor, (at least in the books).
he slept with jane and felt it would be incredibly dishonorable to her if he didn't follow that act with a marriage proposal.
jane was a westerling, and putting her before his own kin was indeed a fatal flaw, if not treasonous.
indeed.
the only thing that marriage brought into play was 50 swords and a few knights.
geopolitically speaking, it was suicidal.
even *if* he hadn't already made promises to the freys and also wasn't in need of every sworn sword he could get, marrying such an unimportant noblewoman would've been stupid in the long run.
ned stark married a daughter of house tully, that was a politically savvy marriage.
if robb didn't marry a frey, he'd need to marry either the daughter of a vassal lord or of a major non-rival lord (i.e.
not a lannister or one of their sworn banner lords).
he should have rammed the mud gate this sounds horrifyingly euphemistic.
wait until you hear about the red wedding give me ten men and i'll impregnate the bitch how does this make any sense?
they're ned stark-ing themselves.
refusing to forsake their honor even if it means their downfall.
robb stark got stabbed in the back.
robb stark beheaded his most loyal bannerman (and distant cousin, remember what the gods think of kinslaying) for murdering a pair of lanniater pows in retaliation for jaime killing his son in battle, and catelyn subsequently agreeing to a hostage exchange (jaime for her daughters).
morally and ethically, robb made the right decision.
practically, however, it was suicide.
he compounded this by knocking up some minor noble wench and marrying her, breaking his marriage contract with walder frey.
he starts on a moral and ethical high, to end on a moral and ethical low.
i wouldn't really say robb stark got stabbed in the back.
he knowingly entered a political alliance, and then he betrayed that alliance almost immediately.
for all his battlefield wit he sure didn't honor the agreements he made very well.
still not the same as inviting you to a wedding feast with the insipid and deliberate pre-meditation of you and your family's murder.
fuck the freys.
nothing will get better in this country until we end the competition for blaming which side is held to a lower standard and start holding our own parties to higher standards.
i feel like this is what we are saying but the other party isn't even playing the same game at this point.
democrats: "ha ha!
now they will have to start taking responsibility for their actions!"
republicans: "one down."
this really is more about internal politics and 2020 strategy than anything else.
the sudden push for the democrats to turn against al franken, which all happened in the last 48 hours leading up to this, was largely driven kamala harris an kirsten gillibrand.
gillibrand's public call for franken to resign yesterday which was immediately followed by over 20 people, including harris who called for it on cnn, had obviously been very well coordinated and planned.
franken was looking at running for president in 2020 and so are harris and gillibrand.
he is a big star for the democrats and has much more name recognition, so they saw this as an opportunity to take him out now while he was hurt by this, so that they don't have to take him on in the 2019 dnc primaries.
it was the shot that lead to this moment today.
after that a story was "leaked" to the press that franken was going to resign tomorrow, and by the time franken had come out and said it wasn't true a few hours later it had already been reported everywhere and it just gained it's own momentum.
in what way?
minnesota has voted for the democratic presidential candidate 7 times in a row.
the seat is safe.
it's still a democratic vote.
edit: ok, i get it.
no seat is safe, mn is full of conservatives and santa isn't real.
i'll go back to being miserably aware of how shitty everything is.
dems will probably win, but [it's not as blue as you think.
](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-will-likely-hold-frankens-seat-but-minnesotas-not-as-blue-as-it-seems/) it’s never as blue as it seems, red takes over anywhere that’s not a major city.
isn't that true like for the entire country?
not even the us.
look at the election maps in turkey for the last election.
it is a global thing that rural people tend to vote with very different points of view than urban people.
nothing new under the sun.
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_general_election,_june_2015#/media/file:turkish_general_election_2015,_provinces_and_districts.png) is a recent election map for turkey.
the yellow portion is the akp, which is their conservative party.
seem [familiar](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2016/countymappurple1024.png)?
(red is conservative in us) posting this because a lot of people i talk to and see on reddit feel that this is unique to their country, when it's a worldwide trend.
i have traveled a lot.
and the way people see the world in rural louisana is not far from people i have spoken with in rural areas of china.
seems we are so different, until you realize we aren't.
part of the fun of traveling!
it's not even limited to humans.
i'll have to paraphrase as i can't dig up a link for the study i read years ago, but essentially a similar pattern of conservative and liberal behavioural differences also exists in rural/urban rats.
it makes perfect sense as evolution hasn't made us completely unique as a species.
if you live in a rural area you have a lot more personal freedom from the interference of other people and much less reliance or need for government.
more government policies (liberal) will almost always negatively impact you.
in urban areas personal freedoms overlap and individuals have much less control over their own environments, so they seek to regulate their environment via government.
that's the best explanation i've heard for the difference of thought between the two areas.
pretty much.
franken needed a recount to get elected the first time, and won by 312 votes.
not safe by any means.
franken was also seen as a joke candidate [minnesota has a history of electing joke candidates](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/jesse_ventura).
yeah, 2 cast members of predator became governors and home alone 2 is in the white house people keep spamming this fully ignoring how he was a comedian when he first ran and that he was re-elected by a sizable majority.
clinton barely won it this year though.
only won by 40,000 people yeah.
that was because it was clinton.... &gt; yeah.
that was because it was clinton.... spot on.
i live in mn, and i voted for clinton, but i -- like many others -- *really* wanted sanders.
what are the odds ellison wins a statewide?
because in mn, people said "she'll win the state anyway, and i don't like her enough to go vote."
do you remember the lengths franken had to go to just to win the senate election he legitimately won?
"dog gon-it people like me"?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_senate_election_in_minnesota,_2008 &gt;al franken took his oath of office on july 7, 2009, more than half a year after the beginning of his term on january 3, 2009. clinton won minnesota by only 45,000 votes.
in 2012, obama won it by over 200,000. in 2008, he won it by almost 300,000. as we saw in the last election, minnesota, like the midwest as a whole, is becoming more purple than blue.
who knows what the state will look like in ~~2020~~ 2018 when his seat is up for the special election, especially considering republicans typically outperform in off-years.
edit: special election is in 2018, not 2020. na.
clinton was just a horrible candidate.
obama's first win was a historic event, so that 300k was probably a bit inflated.
assuming the dems don't chose another awful candidate in 2020, numbers should be back up around the obama 2012 numbers.
all the dem senators said he should resign within hours of each other.
it's blatantly obvious what's happening here.
franken is the sacrificial lamb, and with him and conyers gone now, they will be free to take the moral high ground on roy moore.
they can now bash trump and the gop over the head with moore 24/7.
and then the republicans will be like, "wow, the democrats have such higher morals.
we should vote for them."
/s no, but suburban moderate republican voters (notably women) who already despise trump may now have even more reason to turn their backs on the gop.
and they might at least not vote.
i know such suburban republican women voters.
i work with them.
they eat up everything fox news says.
the roy moore and trump accusations are left wing conspiracy theories, and only democrats have actually admitted to it, they say.
democrats always chase these "moderate" voters and don't get them while simultaneously alienating their base.
you're forgetting about abortion.
they'll always vote r, because jesus.
edit: ok look, i want to edit this comment to address pro-life people, because it's apparently mildly visible.
i assume we're all reasonable people capable of having a reasonable discussion.
i apologize for how dismissive my original comment was to your pro-life beliefs, but (as you'll see below) i think there are much more powerful, logical, goal-oriented reasons for being pro-choice (and remember, we're *all* anti-abortion – nobody likes abortions).
at times, it does feel as though pro-life people cling to a belief and close their ears to anything else, which leaves a lot of people feeling the sentiment i originally expressed in a shitty one-liner.
however, i do think that we all at least *want* information presented to us to challenge our beliefs and allow us to grow as people.
so, if you're pro-life, i'd like to give you three thought experiments below with questions included that i'd like you to answer in response to this comment if you have the time and inclination: **1)** 81% of the country thinks that abortion should be legal in at least *some* cases (source: [pew research](http://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion/)).
for example, in situations where the mother's life is in jeopardy, in cases of forced incest, in cases of rape, and other medical or moral reasons.
that's **81%** of americans.
restricting abortion at the federal level in *any way* allows states like texas to pass wildly restrictive laws that limit abortion centers' ability to operate and serve people in these demographics.
arduous state regulations are why there are only [*sixteen* abortion clinics in texas](https://fundtexaschoice.org/resources/texas-abortion-clinic-map/) vs. [218 in new york](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/state-facts-about-abortion-new-york).
breaking it down: - texas has 28m people, for a rate of 1 clinic per every 1.75 *million* people.
- ny has 19.75m people, for a rate of 1 clinic per every 90,000 people.
- tx has 268,000 square miles of land, for a rate of 1 clinic every 16,750 square miles.
- ny has 54,500 square miles of land, for a rate of 1 clinic every 250 square miles.
now, if you're part of the 81% of americans who believe that in *some – any – cases,* an abortion should be legal, you should understand why voting for republicans works against that goal.
any restrictions – any – at the federal level allow states like texas to logistically prevent women in danger from receiving a potentially life-saving abortion.
it is truly impossible for some women in certain states like texas to receive an abortion in *any* scenario because of state laws presenting wildly arduous regulations on the industry, and only left-wing candidates will actually see to it that women in need are able to get abortions when they've reached the point of no other option.
if you're in the 81%, which party do you think will allow life-saving abortions to be administered as needed to women in jeopardy?
if you're not in 81% of americans who believe this, then would you respect the wishes of 4/5 voters and vote for the better policies to pursue to achieve these goals?
**2)** financial pressure of raising a child is the #1 reason people decide to have an abortion.
there is one group of politicians – progressives – that push for tuition-free college, mandatory maternity leave, affordable child daycare, and broader healthcare coverage provided by a government option.
if these policies would all reduce the financial burden of having a child, what do you think would happen to the abortion rate?
additionally, access to contraception and robust sexual education has been proven to reduce abortion rates ([down 42% in colorado since free iuds were offered to women](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/06/science/colorados-push-against-teenage-pregnancies-is-a-startling-success.html)).
if the goal is fewer abortions, which party would you vote for to improve access to contraception?
**3)** a man is dying and needs a heart transplant to live.
he has 24 hours left before he passes, but if he receives a new heart, there is a 99% chance he'll live.
in the next room in the hospital, there is a woman with a healthy heart that matches his needs, and she will 100% die due to injuries sustained in an auto accident.
however, that woman is not an organ donor.
we, as a society, have decided that *her right to her own body* is so sacred, that we will *let that man die* in the next room if she doesn't consent to having her chest opened up and her heart harvested to save another life.
we, as a society, actively and daily choose to let countless people die, leaving behind entire families, because we so value someone's bodily autonomy.
would you be in favor of forced organ donations in cases like the above in order to save a fully-formed life?
if not, do you think that is consistent with your view on abortion, where you want to take away someone's bodily autonomy to save a non-fully-formed life?
very curious as to how pro-life people feel on all of these questions.
thanks for reading.
i am pro choice but i also think people should be organ donors by default, and that it should be pretty much mandatory, or at least very difficult to not donate your organs to save a life.
is that logically and ethically consistent?
i never thought about it like that before.
thanks for the brain teaser.
there's no such thing as the mythical middle-class suburban moderate democrats have spent the last decade chasing.
oh, sure, the middle-class white republicans typically aren't as backwards on social issues as working-class republicans, but the things dems never seem to grasp is that's because they **don't really care.
** they **don't really care** about racism.
they **don't really care** about homophobia.
they want tax breaks for their small businesses.
they want regulations they view as troublesome to go away.
they may join with the dems in condemning far-right-wingers for their racism and sexism and so on, but when the time comes, they'll still vote for them, because they **don't really care.
** edit: the white middle-class voted for trump in the same numbers they did for previous republicans, and formed the core of his support.
they just voted for him _despite_ his racism and sexism, not because of it.
well said.
and this myth that conservative women "despise trump" is so toxically wrong it makes my blood boil.
white women (which encompasses nearly all of conservative women) cast more votes for trump than for clinton.
and if you think anything that's happened in the last year has changed that you're part of the reason progressivism constantly fails to make an impact at the poles.
it's a brilliant plan!
surely the people that voted for the pussy grabbing, compulsive lying, racist dog-whistling, handicap mocking, conman will appreciate the moral superiority of the democrats and shift allegiances.
republicans still whatabout anthony weiner even though he resigned, i guarantee they will whatabout al franken for years.
they couldn't give a fuck that he resigned.
they'll clutch onto this franken scandal with white knuckles.
how about not electing moore to the senate?
people on the right or the center wont care.
&gt; they can now bash trump and the gop over the head with moore 24/7.
as they should........sexual harassment and sexual assault aren't supposed to be partisan issues, yet here we are.
as much as the democrats are going to hurt over this one (love him or hate him, franken is a big character in washington) the democrats would have never maintained their legitimacy in criticizing the republican sexual assaults if they gave al franken a pass.
he's a loss for their party but he granted them some legitimacy in this discussion.
i seriously think this is the biggest reason that they pushed for the resignation so quickly, as opposed to waiting for the investigation.
i worry if this will have the effect they intended.
it now appears only republicans are innocent until proven guilty.
franken has denied most accounts or said they're not as he remembers, but still resigned.
resignation is seen by many a sign of guilt.
whether or not he is or isn't.
they will say, "see, now that roy moore is a senator he can't be actually guilty as he would have stepped down if the claims were legitimate."
ugh it is an extension of prosperity gospel.
"these men are rich because they're good christians," "franken resigned so he must be guilty," "trump and moore won their elections and are completely vindicated because they won.
they must be innocent because they won and are standing firm and tall" you are correct, the worst kind of correct.
let’s see what happens with roy moore.
i’m sure he’ll do the honorable thing and drop out.
/s for many pedophiles, it’s impossible to make ends meet.
these sex criminals are often shunned both socially and professionally, making it extremely difficult for them to find any sort of gainful employment.
but now a group called the gop is trying to change all that: this amazing organization helps disgraced pedophiles rebuild their lives by getting them elected to political office.
if that doesn’t lift your spirits, we don’t know what will.
while most americans are openly disgusted by pedophiles, the bighearted people over at the gop seek to help them find decent, well-paying jobs where they can shape national policy.
you only need to look at the amazing work the gop is doing with pedophile roy moore in the special u.s. senate election in alabama to know that this organization is looking out for the people society tries to put in the margins.
[stolen from clickhole] democrats and liberals need to realize, they aren't playing the same game as the republican party.
the american people need to realize that there's actually really no guardian diety protecting the united states, preventing it from sliding into just being another shithole fallen empire run by idiots into eventual global impotence.
because the rest of the world, especially russia, already knows this.
yeah i don't think so.
i think it's going to be that awesome pattern of democrats taking the high ground and republicans taking advantage of it.
1. they try to reach across the aisle and compromise and aren't able to get much done when they have a majority.
republicans steamroll them when they get into power.
1. they create (relatively) fair voting districts and allow republicans to get into power.
republican state officials create the most egregiously gerrymandered districts in history so they can cling to power despite widespread negative approval ratings.
2. they delay their right to nominate and confirm a lifetime supreme court justice, and effectively give it to the republicans (this one i'll never forgive them for.
as soon as repubs said they'd refuse to see any nominees they should have grown a pair and just pushed him through), and now: 4. democrats encourage their own sexually-harassing senator to step down, republicans simultaneously criticize him while openly supporting a statutory rapist / child abuser, who will become the next senator of alabama.
then of course there's the massively higher amount of money republicans take from corporate interests, and then just coincidentally vote in their favor on even nonpartisan issues like net neutrality.
i'm not saying franken shouldn't have stepped down.
it's just hard when your opposing party's elected officials literally have no values.
&gt;they delay their right to nominate and confirm a lifetime supreme court justice, and effectively give it to the republicans (this one i'll never forgive them for.
as soon as repubs said they'd refuse to see any nominees they should have grown a pair and just pushed him through) i don't have a clue what you're talking about.
how were they supposed to push him through?
republicans controlled the senate.
the president's party does not have a right to confirm a scotus appointment, the senate does.
that was written by someone who literally has no idea how the senate works.
the only way garland could have gotten on to the sc is if obama had made a recess appointment, which would have been very out of the realm of norms (though now, would not look that insane).
nothing the people in congress could have done though.
i thought i heard that they kept like 3 republican senators around at basically all times to do a roll call even over "breaks" so that they could contest a recess appointment (which would have been temporary anyway).
the far out there argument i saw was that the justice is appointed with the "advice and consent of the senate" and some were arguing a refusal to advise meant consent was unnecessary and therefore obama could simply appoint garland with out a hearing at all.
i think the real reason is that even if there was an investigation and it found that accusers stories were embellished or whatever the scandal alone would hurt franken's chance for re-election.
look at hillary's approval ratings before benghazi/emails and you can see that an investigation alone is enough to erode people's trust of a politician over time.
franken's seat will likely be given to a democrat and the democrats still have a good chance to retake the seat when franken's replacement is up for re-election.
of course, this is all only true if the person being investigated is a democrat; if they're a republican the investigation is a witch hunt and fake news planted by the dems to discredit a good christian family man just trying to make our country great again.
&gt; of course, this is all only true if the person being investigated is a democrat; if they're a republican the investigation is a witch hunt and fake news planted by the dems to discredit a good christian family man just trying to make our country great again.
yep.
the christian right is so horned up against the media that moore actually got a 9 point bump with evangelicals after the initial accusations came out.
"well if the liberal media is making up fake news against him, he must be a great guy!"
oh good, now whatever smear campaign (swift boat, benghazi, etc) the republicans come up with, we should just roll over and have that person give up.
yeah, because what's good for political discourse in this country is for people to immediately be forced into resignation the moment they're accused of something.
democrats have the moral high ground.
republicans have the house, the senate, the potus, the supreme court.. it's politics.
the moral high ground doesn't mean shit.
if it did, trump wouldn't have been elected in the first place.
this is what kills me though.
dems are acting as if they needed to do this in order to be credible in asking republicans to do the same--but republicans literally could not care less.
moral high ground or not, they're going to straight up ignore everything and do what they want.
when, in the last decade, has it happened any other way?
all that's happened here is we've lost an important senator.
we gain nothing.
&gt; moral high ground or not, they're going to straight up ignore everything and do what they want.
the republicans get away with this time and time again because their voters allow it.
remember when we were all outraged that a gay soldier was booed during a republican debate?
remember when we were appalled by trump's access hollywood tape?
republicans didn't bat a fucking eye, they stood by their candidate and they will stand behind moore.
&gt; they stood by their candidate and they will stand behind moore.
probably because they don't want moore standing behind them.
&gt; remember when we were all outraged that a gay soldier was booed during a republican debate?
remember this every time they shout about supporting the troops.
i prefer to think about trump shitting on pows because mccain hurt his feelings.
the pro military party shitting on the people who were tortured, not to mention that they don't give a fuck about helping veterans.
its like their feelings on babies, once they're out of the army (womb, though that comparison is admittedly bad), they can literally go die as far as republicans care.
&gt; we gain nothing.
and even worse, we've morally compromised ourselves by selling out actual **justice** for the court of public opinion.
&gt; we posed for the shot.
he immediately put his hand on my waist, grabbing a handful of flesh.
i froze.
then he squeezed.
at least twice.
this was the accusation yesterday that broke the camels back, he posed for a photograph.
no reasonable, rational person would consider that a serious allegation of sexual misconduct, period.
an issue for the left is the perception that they lack backbone and over react to things in order to be unoffensive.
they proved it again yesterday.
republicans are playing checkers while the democrats hit themselves in the face with stick.
man, this gave me a good laugh.
thanks for that.
jesus.
i'm a woman and i am 100% certain i've squeezed people (both male and female) while posing for a photo.
i guess my political career is over.
also a woman.
there are numerous photos of me grabbing other women's boobs when i was in college.
there are also pics of guys doing it to me(in jest) i'm not a victim or a harraser.
this is insanity.
it's fucking absurd.
what's next?
will sherrod brown have to resign because he told a dirty joke?
will john lewis have to resign because he bumped into somebody in an elevator?
omg he squeezed a grown persons waist for a couple seconds?
lock him up in ultra-max!
they stumbled a little bit when pelosi called conyers iconic, and he was allowed to simply retire after using taxpayer funds for his affairs.
i know there are settlements on both sides otherwise the republicans in congress would be making a bigger deal out of these sealed settlements.
i want them all opened so we don't get a tactical application of the truth for political gain.
what good is legitimacy when it doesn't matter a lick in terms of voter outcomes?
do you think republican women or really anyone is going to switch their vote from rep to dem over this?
moore is still leading his opponent in alabama according to several polls!
it doesn't make a lick of difference!
alabama is already a lost cause for democrats.
i think they are trying to reel in the midwest moderates they lost in the last election.
this whole debacle is lose-lose for them though.
they will only appear either hypocritical or weak compared to republicans, no matter which way they choose to go down this road.
they're trying to play prisoner's dilemma against immoral opponents, and it's just terrible game theory.
god we suck at strategy.
it’s friggin alabama.
the democrats shouldn’t be depressed that they’re losing there.
&gt; democrats would have never maintained their legitimacy in criticizing the republican sexual assaults if only the reverse were true.
i honestly have no fucking idea what to think of the republican voter at this point.
what do these people typically get outraged about on a routine basis?
- they get outraged about young girls having sex.
- they get outraged about people who don't adhere to christian/moral values.
this guy fucked a teenage girl (who was underage and couldn't consent) and they are honestly debating whether they should reelect him or not.
i'm not a christian.
i know plenty of good christians who would nail themselves to a cross to end some world suffering.
anybody who calls themselves a christian and would willingly consider reelecting a child rapist is existing in a headspace i can't ever hope to rationalize.
no hate on the good christians.
shame on the ones who overlook scum like roy moore.
the really stupid thing is that the only rationalization for a *lot* of these people is the fact that so many are single issue voters whose main concern is abortion.
and it's demonstrably true that the abortion rate tends to be lower under democrat leadership than conservative leadership.
furthermore, the specific concern of late term abortion is bogus: only 3 abortions occurred in alabama after 20 weeks in 2016, and all three were due to medical necessity (i.e., to save the life of the mother).
doug jones has stated that he does not oppose the current laws which basically say it's legal up to 20 weeks, and after that it requires 48 hours counseling and the practitioner to sanction the procedure based on special circumstances (rape, incest, medical necessity).
so yeah, anyone who's making the argument "child molester vs. murderer" is woefully off-base.
republican voters are a very interesting group, and i am not being sarcastic.
for reference, i grew up in the middle of coal country utah, where both my parents and siblings still live, and i currently live in massachusetts.
culturally you probably cannot find more opposite places in the us.
one difference i have noticed across my own family is that conservative voters play politics as if it is a win-lose scenario.
they enjoy it when republicans win and enjoy it almost as much when liberals lose.
do they love trump?
nope.
but they do love sticking it to the liberals.
in fact, they love pissing of liberals more than they love their own parties political ideas.
i have never received on of those strange fwd: re: fwd: fwd: that quickly summarizes an entire political argument in the caption of a political cartoon from my liberal friends but receive them all the time from my conservative friends.
i am sure they exist in both groups but it the idea of quickly distilling and summarizing an argument in a situation that does not allow for conversation or discourse only exists among one of the sides of my family.
my dad works really hard, there is no doubt about it.
he wants to work at his job, put in his time, go home play some board games and go to bed.
my sister on the other hand loves long complex arguments and discussing the complexities of every point.
my dad does not care about that and doesn't want to spend his time that way and that is how he follows politics.
he wants everything to be easily summarized in a soundbyte and those are his political views.
now look at some of the major ideas behind the political parties and where they stand on issues and try to sum it up in a single sentence that he would be willing to digest.
gun control: r: they want to take your guns.
why: constitution says we can have them.
d: we want to discuss reasonable limitations to purchasing guns, such as background checks.
why: we believe this would reduce firearm deaths and mass shootings.
when you question the republican side you can just keep repeating those two lines again and again and the argument stays the same.
the democrat line is much more complex and when pressed will have a bunch of "we aren't sure", "other countries do it" and after just a few sentences is becomes apparent that the argument on one side is more complex and as such, easier to poke holes in.
many other political arguments follow the same logic.
abortions: god says no.
while the opposite of a woman should have control of her body gets much more complex.
what if the dad wants to keep it?
what if he doesn't?
taxes are the same thing.
everyone wants to pay less in taxes but one sides argument is more easily distilled.
it becomes apparent that there is a pattern between the politics.
one side has much clearer, cleaner messages and those messages resonate with a certain type of person.
it is much easier to digest a soundbyte.
take taxes.
my dad wants less taxes and if the government makes less it will spend less.
he likes that idea and it makes sense to him.
now, he is not going to engage enough in politics to understand that the republicans will tax less but spend the same and this just leads to greater national debt as there is larger deficit spending.
he will not research it well enough since he does not want to devote more than 25 seconds a day to following politics.
now my dad is not a stupid guy.
he was a college professor and has a phd in psychology.
however, his complete lack of interest in politics lets him be taken advantage of since he refuses to follow politics.
he doesn't know who roy moore is.
he doesn't know who al franken is and he couldn't care less since he wants to focus on other things.
if you can pin him down for 15 minutes and ask him specifically about his views on gay marriage, gun control (of which he owns 40), abortion, government spending and how it should be allocated, money in elections and so on he would realize his representatives have never voted the way he believes a single time in 60 years but he would be damned if he would ever vote democrat.
tl,dr: simple messages resonate with certain people who do not care about politics.
one side cares about politics more.
plus it is pretty fun to watch someone who really cares about something you think is stupid not get what they want.
i think this is true its a team sport.
their team is winning.
that's the republican world view.
republican's will never recognize democratic legitimacy, so his resigning won't help with that.
the left that demanded his resignation abandon always abandon the party at the first opportunity anyway.
they'll forget about his resigning on election day and have a new reason why democrats aren't good enough.
bottom line, the only people who feels franklin hurt legitimacy won't still won't care enough to vote d come election time.
can’t wait for reddit next tuesday.
most liberals i know or see on the internet are very pessimistic about the alabama race and assume roy moore will win regardless of polls.
doug jones and moore are tied in the latest polls.
when credible evidence of pedophilia and abuse of authority come out about 1 candidates, and he _still_ has reasonable chance of winning, what reason is there to be optimistic?
it's important to remember that they're probably tied in the polls because people are too ashamed to admit they're voting for the pedophile.
see: trump polling.
no, the polls last year were actually quite accurate.
they put hillary winning by roughly 2%, which she did.
it was the analysis of the polls that were wrong, not the polling numbers.
people weren't ashamed to admit they were voting for trump.
overall nationwide, maybe, but the individual state polls were flawed.
eh, it could go the either way too: too ashamed to admit they’re voting for someone pro abortion or a democrat.
i don't think anybody in that position would vote for doug jones, they just won't vote.
i've seen most polls with moore up by more than the margin of error though i have seen one poll with the reverse (doug jones up by 4-5 points).
here's one that has moore up by 7 points: http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2017/12/roy_moore_vs_doug_jones_latest_1.html sadly, i believe it.
so... see you next tuesday?
watch your profamity.
every democrat i know has already made peace with the fact that roy moore will win next week.
our opinion of alabama is that low.
i'm a republican and refuse to vote for roy moore next week.
hopefully there are a few more like me.
the real question is will you vote for jones or abstain?
this is the question i want answered.
it's great and all that some people are ashamed of roy moore but unless they are going to vote against him, it's all just symbolic and doesn't really mean anything it's honestly not going to be that interesting unless roy loses.
most people are expecting him to win, even democrats.
quote from his speech on the senate floor: *"i of all people am aware that there is some irony in the fact i am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the oval office and a man who repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the senate with the full support of his party.
but this decision is not about me.
it’s about the people of minnesota," franken said.
* just wanted to provide you with the exact quote: “i of all people am aware that there is some irony in the fact i am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape of his history of sexual assault is in the oval office, and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls has the full support of his party,” franken said.
without the rest of that first sentence the quote sounded like a misdirection.
he's done a fairly good job responding to the situation throughout, better perhaps than those who are openly pressuring him.
even though i suspect most of us will remember the blow-by-blow rather than the words exchanged, it's still a relief to see someone behaving like an adult for once and taking responsibility both for mistakes and obligations.
regardless of how his trials go, this quote made is resignation even more important than it already was.
i was praying he'd put the spotlight right on trump after seeing he had an announcement last night.
limbaugh has already primed his audience (of 20 million devoted followers) to expect this.
he told them to expect a franken resignation as part of a ploy to make trump and moore to look bad.
he also told them the ploy it wouldn't work (and then waved his hand like a jedi).
trump and moore need absolutely no help looking bad.
limbaughs a fucking idiot.
&gt; limbaughs a fucking idiot.
i'm not sure if you know this or not, but al frankin (the same dude who's resigning right now) [actually wrote a book](https://www.amazon.com/rush-limbaugh-big-fat-idiot/dp/0440508649) called *rush limbaugh is a big fat idiot*.
it's actually a really entertaining read.
i was not aware, actually, but thats hilarious.
so is the book!
i suggest that one and lies and the lying liars that tell them (with a picture all the fox talking heads on a large tv screen behind al in the cover photo).
and limbaugh was an idiot long before he said this.
so it goes holy fuck this comment chain is amazing.
despite most being negative, i highly suggest reading it.
people's worldviews are fucking vitorol right now.
thanks for recommending.
it's a good reminder of how people think and behave politically we are living in a cold civil war.
he said he's going to resign "in the coming weeks."
he hasn't actually resigned yet, and may drag this out for some time.
the only reason i see him saying he will resign in the coming weeks is he wants to be there for final resolution on the tax bill and the bill to keep the government funded and prevent a government shutdown.
i've been through this entire thread and the amount of polarization is just disheartening.
this country is so fucked.
the anonymity of online forums like this allow people to be much more extreme in their views then they allow themselves to be in real life.
does the anonymity of the ballot box not do the same?
i was talking more about debates in public forums as opposed to debates online.
oh, gotcha gotcha.
i was just defending the aspect that the representatives of the us are at a polarization never before seen, and that's ultimately far worse.
the extremes said on here are put into action during secure majorities.
i've had the opportunity to live in a few countries and rest assured every country has its strengths and its weaknesses, and every country is made of a populace of generally good people often governed by generally shitty people.
america isn't as unique as you may think in that regard.
anyone else feel like sexually assaulted women are being used as pawns in political chess moves?
the mistreatment of women has always being used to incite wars.
those damn romans.
stole the sabine women.
those damn trojans.
stole helen from sparta.
amazing how democrats get together and say "you gotta go, you're hurting the party."
but republicans can't show the slightest hint of integrity and do the same with roy moore.
edit: i see a lot of people missed the story where trump has doubled down his support for moore: auburn, ala. — president trump on monday strongly endorsed roy s. moore, the republican nominee for a united states senate seat here, prompting the republican national committee to restore its support for a candidate accused of sexual misconduct against teenage girls.
from here: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/us/politics/roy-moore-donald-trump.html &gt; amazing how democrats get together and say "you gotta go, you're hurting the party."
republicans don't say that because it's not true for them.
this shit actually hurts the democrats because the people who vote dem actually care about this stuff.
republican voters do not.
"but he molested teenagers!"
"did you *hear* how many times he said he loved america?"
"yes!
america was 14!!!"
it actually is.
republican identification has dropped from 42% in november of 2016 to 37% now.
that's a pretty significant drop.
http://news.gallup.com/poll/223124/democratic-party-maintains-edge-party-affiliation.aspx precedent set.
sexual assault, misconduct, and allegations of the like lead to resignation on the left, but political backing from the right.
voters will decide who they support in the next round of elections.
until then we wait.
that’s not how precedent works.
at all.
ignoring for a moment the tribalism that has become us politics, the descent into sexual assault madness is troubling.
mere accusation is sufficient to ruin someone’s life.
with franken there was strong evidence but there is an ethics investigation and a legal process in the works.
running a campaign of harrassment is close to a modern lynch mob.
and that’s why has happened here with the nonstop pressure for him to resign.
i’m a little troubled by how this has ended.
it’s not healthy from a judicial perspective.
did he do it or not?
in the eyes of the public, yes.
but the public is gullible and easily manipulated.
if mob mentality is where we are going to take things it’s going to get ugly.
i don't know many people who aren't troubled by this.
the average person can see that the situation is completely spiraling out of control.
but what can we do?
we've watched, apathetically, for years as the ingredients for this mess have fallen into place.
i'm disheartened and concerned, but certainly not surprised.
once again, dems have hanged themselves by their own standards, while gop doesn't even agree that it's a standard.
do they really think that trump or moore will step aside now that franken has?
as if they follow his lead or respect him in any way, shape, or form?
i'm not saying that he should have stayed on, if you're a sexual harasser you should step aside.
they have just completely failed to get mass consensus from their opponents.
they will regret franken resigning so soon.
i don't think he should've resigned.
this sets a precedent where accusations alone can destroy careers.
make no mistake, this problem is only going to get worse.
i don't know if he's guilty or innocent, but damn the democrats really turned on him.
almost seems like he was sacrificed to pressure moore.
america stands on the precipice of a fresh moral panic.
buckle up, buttercup.
on the precipice?
we're full on in it right now.
america is always in a superficial moral panic of some kind.
it was mtv, then video games, then rap music, then video games again, then rap music again, then drugs, then rap music again, etc etc etc.
the rise of 24/7 network news only exacerbates this problem by making it entertaining for people.
the outrage becomes fun and rewarding for viewers to engage in.
meanwhile, no moral panic about the actual problems that are getting worse in america like lead in our water making us dumb as fuck and increasing wealth inequality with a forecast of automation making that problem exponentially worse and creating the perfect conditions for violent revolution.
jfc all these democrats climbing over each other to shoot their own with republican-provided bullets.
taking the high road didn't work in 2016 and won't work the next time.
i'm sorry, no matter what, don't start you're resignation speech with shooting fire at others- even if it is trump- when you're being called out for the same exact thing.
he had no other choice almost every democratic senator said you have to go now i'd like to see what republican senators say when roy moore steps into the building.
here, i'll answer that: "welcome!
please vote for our agenda."
"the other guy (who prosecuted kkk murderers) is weak on crime.
so vote for our candidate!
so what if he's a pedophile, he's *our* pedophile."
not only did he prosecute kkk members, he also prosecuted child predators.
ironic.
he could save others from predators, but not his seat (assuming he loses)
i guess i could understand banning books called "how to escape from prison."
not sure how a book about the true meaning of christmas made the list.
they ban pop up books.
nothing to do with the content.
other banned children's books are out for similar issues, the hardcovers of many kids books can be extra durable and thick and this has led to contraband or weapons issues.
i had to scroll way too far to get to an actual explanation, damn.
thank you!
this seems perfectly reasonable, to me.
i'd rather they're banning books for practical reasons rather than political ones, no matter how abhorrent.
the only real inconsistency i found in their policy in this article is that freakonomics was banned in part due to the segment on race, but mein kampf and some of david duke’s books were allowed (i’ve never read any of these books but i can’t imagine you can get much more incendiary than professional racists).
freaknomics also pretty much explains how to set up an organzied crime ring, which is a direct threat to prison safety.
mein kampf really only sorta explains why an early 20th century european should hate the jewry.
it's more of danger evaluation thing than an ideology thing, i think.
mein kampf is also damn near unreadable: even people who have to read it is part of a requirement rarely manage to do more than skim it, if that.
i have read it, it is probably partly translation issues, but it was not particularly easy or fun to read.
it has been over a decade since i read it, but i remember it being tough to get thorough.
it's worse in german.
a drunk 8 year old could write more coherent.
apparently the whole title is "my struggle with the german language."
mein kampf (mit deutsch) i am imagining an 8 year old saying "hold my beer" so, a german 8 year old.
*coherently source: am a drunk 8 year old.
i always completely fuck up that word... english be hard man.
it's supposedly just as awful in german as well.
its not translation issues yeah, i read in ian kershaw's biography of hitler that it was kind of a common joke in nazi germany that everyone owned mein kampf but nobody actually read it because it was so poorly written.
misdirection titles on reddit are popular these days ~~god forbid you read the article!~~ heh, i would've, but i'm out of nyt articles this month.
why not just get softcover versions?
oh man they could do “prison edition” releases just like international edition textbooks they might, the article cites specifically the pop up version.
also maybe children's books don't have softcover versions, because if you've ever dealt with toddlers, they'll tear up pages and covers of books for fun.
so it completely depends on if the publisher makes a soft cover version available.
i don’t know if this is true but it sounds good &gt; according to the texas department of criminal justice's policies, a book, magazine or other publication can be banned because it contains: &gt; * information on the manufacture of explosives, weapons and/or drugs.
&gt; * "material that a reasonable person would construe as written solely for the purpose of communicating information designed to achieve the breakdown of prisons through offender disruption," like strikes or riots.
&gt; * "graphic presentations" of illegal sex acts, "such as rape, incest, sex with a minor, bestiality, necrophilia or bondage."
sexually explicit images.
"naked or partially covered buttocks" does not constitute reason for automatic disapproval.
staff review medical journals, reference materials, art books and other publications containing nudity on a case-by-case basis.
&gt; * information on criminal schemes or "how to avoid detection of criminal schemes."
&gt; * the book can also be banned for how it's manufactured.
if the binding, cover or other parts can be used to hide contraband, it won't be allowed.
&gt;that's why several pop-up books, such as harry potter film wizardry and the amazing spider-man, were banned.
other children's titles like hello kitty and the homer simpson book were put on the disapproved list because they had "uninspectable" covers or "multi-layer pages."
&gt;waldo may have stripes, but he's a no-show in texas prisons this christmas because his book "contains stickers."
[ source](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/2017/11/27/texas-prisons-ban-freakonomics-big-book-angels-adolf-hitlers-mein-kampf) prisoners can be crafty as fuck.
this is so true i saw a guy who liked to take top ramen packets and make purses, belts, and photo frames in jail!
oh and a shank made from the center of the deodorant.
i would however put out there i was not a fellow inmate just a 16 year old criminal justice student so they showed us all kinds of crazy things.
ey, boy, you wanna learn about criminal justice?
how about you learn some street justice first!
*stabs you with deodorant, you wind up smelling amazing the rest of the day* when you're stuck in a cell for over 20 hours a day, you'll eventually find a way to kill someone with the little resources you have necessity is the mother of invention.
the article states it is a book that could easily hide contraband (presumably because of its extra thick pages).
assuming that it's a normal pop-up book, it's got thick pages, as well as gaps in them to account for different pop-up scenes.
it's rather logical.
i've heard people argue that die hard is a christmas movie.
never heard the one about men kampf being a christmas classic.
it is if you want a white christmas.
rudolph the anti-semitic reindeer is one of my favorite christmas songs.
santa claus is comin to poland is definitely my all time favorite i'll be home for kristallnacht is a classic "rudolph the red nose panzer" is better.
grandma got run over by the wehrmacht walking home from mein haus gesternacht, you may say there's no such thing as nazis, but as for me und opa, we believe.
you better shut up you better not cry in the attic we hide and im telling you why eva braun is coming to town all i want for christmas is jews nazi the snowman is a personal fav.
all i can picture is a tiger tank with the end of the barrel painted red..... don't forget about the drumming classic "little jewish boy" all i want for christmas is a two front win 🎶*”waffen in a winter wonderland*”🎶 on the first phase of dday my true love gave to me.. this all got way too dark "slayin jews are you listening.
see their blood as it glistens.
it's a wonderful day i'm happy to say waffin in a winter wonderland."
deck the halls with shower heads... it's a mouthful, but "all i want for christmas, is a genetically pure superior race" has a catchy rhythm to it.
"alll i want for christmas is jews" my family gassed by him purrumpupumpum.
our finest jews we bring par rum pum pum pum now get in there and clean out that gas chamber purrumpupumpum.
little gunner boy who could forget the classic “all i want for christmas is a thousand year reich” or ‘fairytale of auschwitz’ and the boys of the waffen ss choir were singin' "stile nacht" until on top of their heads, some bombs were dropped it was christmas eve babe, in the concentration camp, an old jew said to me, won’t see another day.
and then he sang a song, the rare old mountain jew.
i turned my face away, and dreamed a world with out jews.
i like "rudolph the panzerkampfreindeer" much!
*good king hitler* will always have a special place in mein heart.
*in meinem herzen i just can't get enough of 'all i don't want for christmas is jews'.
kristallnacht kristallnacht, killing is okay, seeing our enemies blood makes us go cray cray with his trusty team of reindeer, led by rudolph lundgren.
what if his entire head is just one big red shiny nose?
write that down!
i like that!
he's one big red nose on rudolph lundgren's body.
polish santa claus goes up the chimney das heißt santa **k**laus!
you know dasher and dancer and prancer and vixen, you know comet and cupid and donner and blitzkrieg... [removed] frosty the pure white snowman rudolph the skinhead reindeer* what about the famous christmas classic "all i want for christmas is jew" i prefer "i want a little lebensraum for christmas" don't we all?
just a small town jew hiding in a lonely attic took a mitnacht zug going anywhere... but probably to the poland man, this just keeps going on and on and on... ah christmas, the day we celebrate the birth of (((jesus))).
it's ironic because this song was written by a jew whoa man you can't just drop a hard j like that... sorry, meant to say ewe.
my baaad.
reworking classics like frosty the aryan.
frosty the yes man, was a man without a soul.
fun fact: die hard is based on a book titled nothing lasts forever by roderick thorp.
it's a fun yet short book that any fan of the movies would love, as it shows the inspiration that sparked the classic film.
&gt; i've heard people argue that die hard is a christmas movie [people argue against that?
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0cl__tvp-o) it is a christmas movie!
i think everyone should read mein kampf once.
not because it's a good book but because it's a very bad book that romanticizes righteous indignation at perceived injustices.
for propaganda such as that book to be avoided and countered we must be well versed at recognizing it.
we live in a world where morality is recognized more often from who wins an argument than who is actually morally correct.
that book is a useful tool at demonstrating exactly how people can be manipulated against their own interests.
you have to understand the enemy if you wish to battle him as he will battle against you.
this point is decent.
once tried reading it but got so fucking bored that i didn't feel like bothering.
it genuinely has the feel of some low-budget religious pamphlet given out by fundies on streets.
it's almost impossible to understand because it has so much about local politics of the time i've heard it's also worse in german than it is in english.
apparently the translators tend to clean up some of the incoherence.
[deleted] it's actually a tradition in my house.
well that's because die hard *is* a christmas movie calling die hard anything less than a christmas classic for the whole family is sacrilege die hard is absolutely a christmas movie and no one can tell me otherwise.
they actually have a die hard christmas book now, hopefully that’s not banned too &gt; the pop-up edition of “a charlie brown christmas” is prohibited (could hide contraband inside it) just saying.
title is a little misleading... i wish that they had more titles like this.
i loved how they buried the reason a little bit in the article.
no one should mention the reason and just let the plebs argue over the title not just a 'little', it is meant to invoke outrage and create the false notion that the texas bureaucracy is incompetent/unwise.
i'm not an american and can't do anything about an american news outlet but i'm disgusted by this kind of journalism.
meant to elicit a response and it's the millionth time we've seen an article like this on all.
it's amazing how many comments here are raging on the book title being banned.
it's not the book title, it's the binding and construction of the book itself.
the pop-up version of mein kampf would be banned too no worries, the guards will still snuggle them in like they do with all the drugs edit: there is no fucking way i'm correcting my misspelling.
it's better this way.
&gt; snuggle what kinda guards do they have in texas?
cuddly ones i hope!
just a big teddy bear stuffed full of heroin!
it makes a great [christmas present](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/04/26/bags-heroin-found-hidden-inside-teddy-bear-police-said/lylnhp4rp7e1ji1aaxk1pm/story.html) this time of year.
*baby's first drug mule* either steers or queers from what i've been told.

that sounds fabulous all kinds!

* a few remaining old vietnam war era ptsd former .mil veteran types (guy shot a phone for ringing) * lots of younger middle eastern war(s) ptsd .mil veteran types * jaded, bitter middle-aged men and women.

don't forget the hordes of single moms prisons are the best argument against prohibition.
if you can't keep drugs out of prison how the hell do people expect to keep them off the streets?
"by throwing everyone who likes them in prison!
then there won't be a market for them on the streets, only in prison."
-someone, probably right.
its a strictly controlled environment with cameras and shit so how can they except it to work anywhere else.
the portugese have the right idea.
r/wholesomedrugs the going rate for one, butthole flavored pouch of dipping tobacco is $200.
prison break would be pretty weird if everyone was a little too cozy with each other i have charlie brown christmas for the kids.
was thinking this ban is because charlie brown christmas is big enough to hide contraband in.
it has spaces for sounds effects, batteries and such.
thinking the kiddie sound effects version of mein kampf has yet to come out.
(although his thoughts on exterminating jews as the work of the lord could be somewhat considered christmassy?
maybe not.)
i mean there was a certain amount of people going *up* chimneys some of those books are banned for perfectly valid reasons, like they might have potential to hide weapons.
they generally don't ban for content unless it's explicitly violent or depicts criminal acts.
&gt; like they might have potential to hide weapons sounds like a good reason to ban certain editions.
but i hear you can hide a rock hammer in a bible.
i mean i'm actually with the aclu.
i think they should be able to access the same books we get, but i just hate these clickbait headlines that suck the nuance out of everything.
they have policies that, however hamfisted, are at least consistently enforced.
this is the main push for a movement to tablets in many states, it's infinitely harder to smuggle material in this way.
lots of contraband moves through the libraries and with so many books it is next to impossible to inspect every single book on a regular basis.
it's also easier to track communication electronically.
one the second day of our facility using the e-messaging system on our tablets our filters caught someone threatening to commit suicide and we were able to send the local police to do a wellness check and pull the inmate into an office to let them know what happened and that everything was ok within hours of the message being sent.
a week earlier and it would have taken three days or so to find out anything was wrong.
interesting!
but aren't tablets themselves usable as weapons?
and contain a lot of pointy metal?
just curious.
yes, they could be used as a blunt weapon, but he amount of metal in them is quite small.
ours are made of clear plastic and cost $200, the inmate receives the first one free, if they are broken the inmate pays for a replacement.
this is of no-cost to the tax payer because a private company provides the tablets and in return generates a small amount of revenue from the use of phone and messaging services, which is still cheaper than a stamp for the inmates.
our tablets have access to six websites (cnn, whitehouse.gov, can't remember the others but they are all news sites) and no commenting privileges for those sites.
they also have access to music and a small number of games (company has to pay for the tablets and infrastructure somehow).
the tablets have been instrumental in reducing violence in our units because now people can remain in their cells and still access to phone calls and entertainment which allows potential victims to remain in the safety of their cells.
the units are also quieter now as there's less people moving around and less commotion, which makes it easier to supervise the units.
another advantage is that we no longer have to read every piece of mail, our filters flag suspect material for review before it is released, but over 90% of the mail goes through without a problem.
six months on we've had zero instances of a tablet being used as a weapon and we believe the pros far outweigh the cons.
we track all violence in our facilities and we have seen a dramatic drop in inmate-on-inmate and inmate-on-staff assaults since the tablets went live six months ago.
you guys documenting all this?
would make for a great paper or report for public consumption.
our warden has done several interviews with local media because this is a hot button issue, many people in this state watch the shawshank redemption and think those guys had it soft and prison should be more punitive.
easy enough to detect when a connected tablet goes dark/offnetwork and check in on it.
also, if you put enough valuable stuff on the tablet (commissary access, visitor access, card games, virtual library), and have the camera constantly feeding back to a security post, few inmates would risk messing with it as it would be extremely traceable, visible, and screw them over inside.
&gt;clickbait headlines that suck the nuance out of everything.
so basically ~~facebook~~ ~~reddit~~ ~~the internet~~ ~~america~~ ~~modern civilization~~ the fucking human race for all of eternity.
if you wet the pages, roll, squeeze, and allow it to dry, a bible *becomes* a hammer.
millwall brick anyone?
someone above in the comments pointed out that hardcovers of childrens books can be used to make weapons which is why they are sometimes banned.
well, thank god they banned "how to fake a moon landing."
we don't need any of these knockoff kubricks picking up tips while they're doing time.
let's face it, no matter what books are on the ban list there's going to be a bunch of fucked up titles that are allowed.
so, why bother banning any?!
alcatraz allowed a book titled "how to build a raft," so yeah, why bother?
i'm kind of surprised that building a raft would be enough of a topic to fill an entire book.
probably detailed multiple methods of raft building depending on the materials and tools at hand.
i like to think that there are factions within the raft building world, different schools of thought that they were comparing etc.
and then they have a tournament and fight.
there'll be an anime about raft-building with tournaments and drama and amazing fuckin' music.
about raft-making.
they can make volleyball entertaining, they can do raft-making, too.
dude, they made an anime about cycling that has more drama when people drop out of the race than people fucking dying.
it's great.
haha i can picture it now.
crazy music and monologues followed by an intense scream in agony as they decide they can't go on and have to drop out and continue their normal lives.
like all that shit happens than off camera the character just kind of looks around a little embarrased, grabs their bike, and walks home while the dramatic music disappears in the distance with the rest of the racers when tying a knot becomes 3 filler episodes.
knot-chan has noticed meee it's not like i wanted you to be tied, two-half-hitches-chan.
...baka.
id watch it.
you could easily make it some crazy shonin where it's crazy survive or die obstacle courses where only one team can live and be crowned raft kings at the end sponsored by red bull.
[relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1095/) exactly, they should have checked out building a raft from materials commonly found in prison when locked in that same prison.
no wonder they were in prison, the buffoons.
'monte cristo, you'll like it, it's about a prison break' 'should we file it as educational too?'
if the requirements for such a raft are tools and lumber and the like, then such a book would probably be useless to an escaped inmate on alcatraz anyway.
if anything keeping that book around was probably just their way of taunting the prisoners.
that's how the world's most famous prison break got away, they built a inflatable raft out of raincoats.
didn't read the article, eh?
most of what they banned were because of how the books were constructed physically could be used to smuggle stuff in.
it didn't have a lot to do with the actual content of the stories/books.
theoretically the ban exists to keep out things that could potentially aid a convicts in breaking out, getting outside communications, fashioning weapons, or smuggling contraband goods.
because, if you read the article, it's not always the content, it's also that the books can be used to hide contraband.
in the cases where it is content, its because some things just become masturbation material for sex offenders.
&gt;but the pop-up edition of “a charlie brown christmas” is prohibited (could hide contraband inside it), as is “the color purple,” the 1983 novel that won the pulitzer prize and the national book award (incest).
that said, its pretty obvious its arbitrary on what does and doesn't violate the standards.
the bible also has incest, and violence.
i don't know if mein kamph actually advocates violence, despite the horribleness of the author, it's maybe one of those that taken out of context of the author, doesn't technically violate any standards (haven't actually read it so don't know).
then again, if you're going to ban freakonomics for violating standards for discussing race, i don't think you have a leg to stand on to justify allowing mein kamph.
... you mean to say that you don't believe in curtailing the constitutional rights of incarcerated persons?
what are you, a communist?
*that was sarcasm...* i think its funny (in a very not-funny way) that we assume prisoners do not have rights.
they have all of the same rights as a free person minus, maybe, 2a.
i just started a documentary series on the miami-dade jail and its fucking eye opening how brutal the system really is.
if i was jailed i don't know what i'd do if released.
i would not want to reform.
the folks in this show (netflix) are innocent (pre trial) and its a fucking terrifying environment.
one dude had a suspended license and drove.
got his ass beat by 12 dudes and the guards look the other way.
cant remember the name of the show but its louis theroux who does the telling of the tale.
maybe read the article.
it's the pop-up version of *a charlie brown christmas* that is banned, and not due to content but because you can hide contraband in it.
its odd that they ban color purple for incest, but not lolita for... well.
i've never read the color purple, but i have read lolita.
the relationship isn't exactly celebrated.
unless that incest results in the character being exposed as despicable, pathetic monster and results in his total undoing, then it's not really a comparison.
the main character's father beats and rapes her.
so it was banned because it depicts rape and not because it was incest?
the article says the reason was incest.
will reddit read the article this time?
let's find out!
this is really misleading.
after looking at the list, other books **allowed** include the royal parchment of black supremacy, the communist manifesto, and the diary of che guevara.
way to mislead the public into seeing a deepening racial divide, nytimes.
this is the dumbest article i've ever seen &gt;but the pop-up edition of “a charlie brown christmas” is prohibited (could hide contraband inside it) so the non pop up edition is fine?
edit: supposedly, the pop up edition of mein kampf is also banned.
yes.
all pop up books are banned.
there was a better article about this that hit the front page a couple weeks ago that actually went into why different books were banned that's what it sounds like.
i mean, i find that to be reasonable.
&gt;this is the dumbest article i've ever seen that doesn't matter to the new york times, what's important is that their advertising sales people can tell potential advertisers that you (and x number of other people) saw it.
this article is so shit that its own subtext and content in parentheses argue against its main premise.
it was painful to read.
its not banned because of the content, its banned because its a pop up book with a hardcover that inmates use to make contraband.
for those being outraged by the headline of banning books, there are some reasons why they do it: &gt; according to the texas department of criminal justice's policies, a book, magazine or other publication can be banned because it contains: &gt; * information on the manufacture of explosives, weapons and/or drugs.
&gt; * "material that a reasonable person would construe as written solely for the purpose of communicating information designed to achieve the breakdown of prisons through offender disruption," like strikes or riots.
&gt; * "graphic presentations" of illegal sex acts, "such as rape, incest, sex with a minor, bestiality, necrophilia or bondage."
sexually explicit images.
"naked or partially covered buttocks" does not constitute reason for automatic disapproval.
staff review medical journals, reference materials, art books and other publications containing nudity on a case-by-case basis.
&gt; * information on criminal schemes or "how to avoid detection of criminal schemes."
&gt; * the book can also be banned for how it's manufactured.
if the binding, cover or other parts can be used to hide contraband, it won't be allowed.
&gt;that's why several pop-up books, such as harry potter film wizardry and the amazing spider-man, were banned.
other children's titles like hello kitty and the homer simpson book were put on the disapproved list because they had "uninspectable" covers or "multi-layer pages."
&gt;waldo may have stripes, but he's a no-show in texas prisons this christmas because his book "contains stickers."
[ source](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/2017/11/27/texas-prisons-ban-freakonomics-big-book-angels-adolf-hitlers-mein-kampf) there's a lot of reasons why they ban books.
some prisoners can be crafty little fuckers, so the prisons have to be very careful with what they allow them access too.
it'd be cool if some of the book makers made special 'prison editions' but i doubt they see much of a reason to do it unfortunately.
i would love for them to have access to a lot more literature, but i understand why a lot of the books go on the ban list.
god damn reddit is becoming fucking awful i’m sick of the misleading and flat out retarded headlines.
just a reminder - most of the banned books are because of physical attributes such as the type of binding.
"texas prisons ban 10,000 books.
no pop-up books or other contraband-prone designs.
normally printed books are allowed."
a more accurate and less inflammatory headline.
how many times have we seen this news now?
at this point, we should start calling it "olds".
what happened to not editorializing titles?
aryan brotherhood is a big deal inside of prisons.
taking away mein kampf would start some bad prison riots.
yea you don't want white power bill startin shit you mean dirty ears bill, right?
that's like giving a child what they want because they throw a tantrum.
except some of those children have nothing to lose and are willing to kill.
a few years ago i read an article about prison gangs in california.
it said that one out of every ten inmate murders in usa are committed by the aryan brotherhood, making them the most murderous prison gang in country.
these guys kill more people then the mexican mafia.
itt people who are outraged because they didn't read the article.
could be charlie brown christmas was banned for depictions of children.
could be its paper was used as rolling paper.
could be people kept stealing the pages as artwork.
could be people were getting so sad reading it they killed themselves.
prisons are weird.
pop up books are thicker and easier to hide contraband in.
as stated in the article why did you read the article when you could have just made assumptions?
the article clearly states that it was a pop up book and that all pop up books are banned because of the potential for hiding contraband.
we also don't know if *mein kampf* was actually reviewed.
just the pop up version is banned.
they were probably making shit out of the cardboard or ripping them out just because.
you could easily find out why by reading the article instead of trying to make a silly joke.
their logic for banning certain books is sound and the titles this writer picked in order to make this a sensationalist article remind why the new york times is the failing new york times.
oh another shit on texas article.
fun.
itt: people who didn't read the article and can't understand why charlie brown was banned politically charged title that doesn't explain the practical contraband-based reasons behind the book bans.
thanks reddit for being prejudiced, divisive, and race-baiting all day and every day.
what the fuck is with those judiciary decisions to grant those warrants???
jesus christ those judges need to be removed.
time to search the judge's house to see if he's a pedophile too.
it is the perfect place for one.
all that "trial evidence" in the basement for safe keeping with inexplicable stains all over them.... it was spooky ghost!
maybe he was just eating a salad when reviewing them and got ranch everywhere.
maybe not - but we should write up the case like "did you know your neighbor, $name, abused his position as judge to assist pedofiles?"
then deliver it to all the neighbors.
the same ones that make teens register as sex offender for sending nudes to one another.
they act as if they're some big moral compass deserving of praise when they're really just ruining teens lives that happened to me and i have ptsd now :) sorry to hear that and i hope you're coping with it in a healthy way!
from my few interactions with police i have bad anxiety just seeing one driving by.
i can't imagine what it must be like having your life torn up by them.. &gt;i can't imagine what it must be like having your life torn up by them.. the real killer is that i never thought i had committed a crime so i never had reason to believe the police would be after me.
then one day they literally kicked in my door and stuck a gun in my face.
i have constant anxiety attacks thinking the police are after me, because why wouldn't they be?
real life has showed me already you do not need to have a logically sound reason to be after someone, you don't need to remember you broke the law to have broken it, nor do you even have to try or want to break it.
i live in constant terror that i'm going to accidentally break the law and go to jail for my entire life and rarely leave my house.
thats not even discussing the pre-freudian methods (and *their* long lasting effects i'm sure you can imagine.)
employed in the sex offender therapy i was forced to attend as a term of probation even though i didn't need to be there.
have you considered doing an ama?
many years ago when i was freshly out of all that mess i considered it and was denied and my post removed because it "wasn't unique" you could try (forgive me if this is the wrong sub, i'm too lazy to check) /r/casualiama removed?
you are much nicer than me.
judges rarely actually read warrant applications.
it's one of the areas of our justice system that needs *massive* reform.
judges are supposed to be a check on the ability of law enforcement to search people's homes/possessions/cars/whatever, but are instead little more than a rubber stamp.
need to remove this current system.
and replace it with a system that has blackjack and hookers!
in fact, forget the system and the blackack!
it's not supposed to happen, but i bet often times a judge will just rubber stamp everything on his desk.
doesn't absolve them of responsibility.
an explanation isn't necessarily an excuse.
exactly.
he approved a child being viagrad up and forced to masturbate in front of a pedophile.
his stamp is on that form.
if my signature was on something like that i'd be in jail pretty damn fast.
i could throw around "i barely even read it!"
all i want.
as u/mikeavelli said, i wasn't making a value judgment really.
the judge as immunity though, more than likely.
the judge probably had a big stack of papers and just had his assistant stamp each one.
it doesn't make it right though, no.
&gt;when this bizarre effort was unsuccessfully attempted, abbott then obtained a second warrant authorizing police to escort sims to a hospital for an "erection-inducing injection."
this injection ultimately never took place after massive public outcry.
&gt;**abbott committed suicide in december 2015 when officers came to arrest him on separate charges relating to pedophilia.
** after all of that, the cop was a pedophile.
that's fucking insane.
i feel like that point should have been self evident during all that, not after.
maybe his coworkers thought he was just really, *really* dedicated.
/s this is disgusting on my part, and kind of shows how my mind works, but this story and your comment reminds me of a south park episode.
the one where one of the leading detectives becomes so zealous at busting johns that he goes undercover as a prostitute and spend the episode blowing and being buggered by customers and then arresting them, leaving his colleagues confused and wondering about his dedication.
"thanks baby, you gave my hole quite the stretch!"
“th... t.... that’s the code word guys!” this happened in real life with our very own president roosevelt - the newport sex scandal https://www.thedailybeast.com/franklin-d-roosevelts-forgotten-anti-gay-sex-crusade damn it you beat me to it.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/newport_sex_scandal the dollop podcast did an episode on it.
highly recommend.
idk, it seems less disgusting then a testament to how tapped into our sick culture south park is.
what episode is that?
i have to watch that!
butters bottom bitch bitch don't you want to start making some real fuckin money?
you knowimsayin'?
yes i think i know what you are saying.
it's the one where butters becomes a pimp.
yes i understand what you are saying.
daddy i did good.
i did real good.
can i have a smiley face sticker?
that whole scene cracks me up.
"do you *know*.
what i am *saying*."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imyci3uwxbg for the lazy the evidence bags... teens become registered sex offenders by having a photo of their own body.
that's, a criminal record and their futures ruined because they saw their own naked body.
in the meantime, there are cops looking at child porn all day.
they possess it as evidence.
in some cases, they're directly examining and photographing teenage boys' penises.
cops are just as prone to being sickos as anybody else... arguably more.
of *course* there's going to be pedophiles sprinkled into the police force.
but in the meantime, they are literally the only people who are viewing, possessing, and creating child "pornography" with impunity.
by policy, they are doing it.
and if that detective didn't eventually get outed as a pedophile, i'm sure everything he did according to this case would stand and be defended by the system.
my point is, how fucked up is it that your 15 year old kid can get a criminal record and be labeled a sex offender for seeing his own dick and balls, but any 'ol detective can come along and say "we need to see this kid's erect dick and balls" and a judge goes "okie dokie!"?
why isn't the judge's named mentioned and why isn't he also being sued?
the judge is expected to have more legal knowledge than an investigator i would imagine, and would think that the judge who signed the warrant would be at least as liable as the officer.
either way, pretty insane stuff.
yeah, if they're saying that the cop doesn't get qualified immunity because it was so obviously unconstitutional then that judge needs to be removed from the bench asap.
i am just picturing one officer saying "hey guys, i think this guy might be a pedo."
and everyone else going, "... no, that doesn't seem right" then officer a hopefully started to investigate.
what's *really* insane is that a judge issued a warrant to authorize an erection-induced injection.
that judge should be disbarred.
that judge should not just be disbarred, but fucking prosecuted and thrown in jail.
as well as the prosecuting attorney.
he is just as disgraceful, if not more, than the judge.
or do the same as abbott.
bet he was a pedo buddy of the cop.
open an investigation into him.
judge, abbot, prosecuting attorney and anyone else involved in allowing this to move forward should be removed from their jobs and a billboard showing what they authorized should be displayed in their hometowns and on their front lawn.
everything that i said above is crazy, but is it as crazy as a cop asking to see a kids pee pee.
abbot can't be removed from his job, because he's dead.
he committed suicide when he was being investigated for charges relating to pedophelia.
&gt; he committed suicide when he was being investigated for charges relating to pedophelia.
what an unlikely turn of events!
are you seriously telling me that the police officer who tried to use the legal system to restrain a teenage boy and educe medical professionals to use prescription narcotics to make him aroused against his will so he could photograph it was a pedophile?
i just can't believe it!
exactly.
the judge is supposed to be a check to prevent this sort of thing.
the judge is equally as culpable as the cop.
and not just *one* ruling, *but two* against the privacy and sanctity of a child's body.
disgusting.
i'll take "shit that doesn't surprise me" for $1000, alex.
&gt; abbott then obtained a second warrant authorizing police to escort sims to a hospital for an "erection-inducing injection."
the judge who approved this should be tarred and feathered.
i dont usually advocate for out-of-band justice, but seriously, fuck that judge.
that's my first thought as well.
how the fuck did abbott even got the warrant?
what kind of judge would approve such a thing?
an accomplice i can't decide which warrant is crazier though: * warrant to photograph minor's erection * if minor can't (or won't) get hard, warrant to take minor to hospital and (forcibly?)
have his dick injected with boner drugs.
ok now i'm genuinely curious... did the warrant explicitly authorize force during any of this... if it did, how in the hell is the judge still practicing ?
a porno judge.
did they investigate the judge for pedophilia?
imo he is more liable than abbott is.
cops ask for illegal warrants all the time.... because they don't study law for years.
it is the judges job and not the cops to determine whether a warrant is illegal or not.
i read it first thinking the kid committed suicide and then saw the name again and was like wtf?!!
yeah, when i first read that, i was so sad that these evil people made this kid kill himself.
then i realized it was the cop who committed suicide, and i was glad.
i know that's not a very christlike attitude, but that was my initial impulse.
i hate when the wicked take advantage of the innocent or weak.
my sense of "justice" trumpets, and i imagine a world without selfish, evil people who prey on others.
i'm trying to rid my character of said impulses; but, for now, it remains.
the world is a better place without him.
this is a human reaction.
i remember this.
totally sickening.
we’ll never really know how many people he got to.
i’m glad he’s dead, but would rather see him in prison.
why?
then he's just soaking up tax dollars.
good riddance.
i grew up in manassas.
there was a local sheriff's deputy who lived down the street from me.
he was arrested for possession of child pornography.
i know his name and everything.
manassas is a fucked up place.
they were the first locality to pioneer the kind of policing that made arpaio (the arizona policeman trump pardoned) infamous in the first place.
&gt;shapiro i think to you mean arpaio.
to us its insane.
to the pedophile police detective investigating child pornography, he probably saw it as an opportunity to obtain new pictures for his own purposes.
prosecutor that went along with this travesty should commit suicide too.
i'd rather he be kept alive and made an example of.
this type of behavior needs to be shamed in the most extreme way possible.
him killing himself and leaving behind a ghost story doesn't change the system.
him being made an example of and d.a.
's/judges/civil rights groups using him as an example would serve the system as a whole better.
trust me, i understand your sentiment and i agree with you in the disgust/outrage factor.
that being said, him being haunted by this and using this against the courts is better for the system as a whole.
his erection-inception injection suggestion was met with rejection?
good thing they questioned intentions despite his profession and dispensed poor reception.
seems like staff got on subreption prevention once he mentioned detention.
???
i cant imagine why anyone would require anyone to get an injection that causes an erecvtion for the lw.
why was this like five paragraphs in.
should be the lede.
pedophile cop forced teen to masturbate.
if you want to be really outraged, read king's dissenting opinion on this case.
to judge king all police officers have a moral duty to uphold the sanctity of every court order without hesitation, and there's nothing unconstitutional about forcing a 17 year old to jack off under duress in front of a bunch of grown, armed men.
our justice system, ladies and gentlemen.
that was the opinion of 1/3rd of the judges who decided this case.
https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4323254-162174-p.html#document/p21 edit: victim was 17 y/o, not 15. so the judge says “i was just following orders” is a moral imperative regardless of the situation?
couldn't even make up this crazy shit.
[the migram experiment is still very relevant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milgram_experiment) it shows that this type of thinking is extremely common in all people.
people extremely capable of rationalizing their evil acts as being the fault of an authority rather than themselves.
*milgram the results of this study are literally terrifying when you think about it.
really vivid lesson on why you should always question authority, at least internally.
sounds like something a nazi would say!
(oh shit they did) i think that was actually the rationale behind the study originally.
to understand how seemingly ordinary people could be capable of horrid deals in nazi germany.
i can’t believe preparing to take pictures of a minor masturbating would even be justifiable for collecting evidence.
wouldn’t the officers be especially making child pornography?
&gt; wouldn’t the officers be especially making child pornography?
no, no, no.
when the state does it it's not illegal.
cuz... reasons.
hm..... where have i heard this before?
/s you don't know how sarcasm works.
you'd be amazed how many people that logic appeals to.
whenever i bring up misconduct in the justice system to right wingers the response "but it's the law!"
comes up, as if a judge or politician ordering something is the only thing that separates right from wrong in america yeah... that's sexual coercion and maybe rape.
"do this sex act against your will or go to jail!"
"do this sex act or i'll stab you with a knife!"
what's the fucking difference?
a jail houses prisoners, a knife cuts things.
shit.
we need a new argument he starts quoting the federalist papers...i couldn't read anymore laughing too hard.
contains 1000% dv of dietary irony.
life in prison.
you don’t fuck around being a judge.
you can’t be that demented.
who knows who and what else this man has damaged.
life in prison.
definitely needs to be thoroughly investigated and *all* of his previous cases and rulings reviewed in excruciating detail.
this is just......my god, wow.
how is that not child porn?
the first thing that irritates me, which shouldn't, is the judge's use of m dashes.
i spend a fuck ton of time learning how to do shit like properly cite shit from some ivy-league shit guide called the bluebook.
when judges don't care, i don't know why i should, either, but that's beside the main point.
second, i don't understand how a judge could reasonably believe the police didn't violate any rights here.
per the dissent's opinion, on p. 25, the search warrant reads: &gt; to any authorized officer: &gt; you are hereby commanded in the name of the commonwealth to &gt; forthwith search the following place, person, or thing either in day or night: &gt; trey austin sims, date of birth [].
a white male, &gt; approximately 5’10” tall and approximately 150 pounds.
&gt; for the following property, objects and/or persons: &gt; photographs of the genitals, hands, and other parts of the &gt; body of trey sims that will be used as comparisons in &gt; recovered forensic evidence from the victim and suspect’s &gt; electronic devices.
this includes a photograph of the &gt; suspect’s erect penis.
i imagine that the methods of executing a search warrant vary and, depending on the circumstances, merit some action done at the discretion of the police to achieve its means.
thus, if obtaining the photographs meant retrieving the phone, yes the police are authorized to retrieve the phone.
police may need a separate warrant to unlock the phone if the user secured it with a pin.
a completely separate question, but also something that a warrant can be issued for.
but for a judge to think that this warrant authorizes police to achieve these photos by requiring a target furnish them live is absurd.
in the above hypothetical, police assume the pictures already exist.
it's just a matter of accessing them.
what the judge looks like he's condoning is requiring someone to create something that, but for the police's request, would not have existed.
gross.
if anyone can enlighten me otherwise, i'm open to conversation.
but the judge's dissent is disturbing.
judge king is a clinton nominee, believe it or not.
pedophile cop tried to use the courts to legally take pics of a teen masturbating, failed, got busted as a pedophile on an unrelated event and committed suicide.
court now says the teen can sue his estate.... what in the fuckity fuck... good he can sue but that is some crazy shit.
i vote for a slight tweaking of "the aristocrats".
at first i was like: "eeeeeverybody, eeeeeeevrybody, everybody wants to be a cat" and then i was like: "oh no.
god no.
no no no no no" &gt;at first i was like: &gt;"eeeeeverybody, eeeeeeevrybody, everybody wants to be a cat" are you my soulmate?
27 year old male, still watches old disney movies on a regular basis.
aladdin is my fave, though.
aristocats was my dad's fave.
you are the worst person on the internet.
take your upvote and get out of my sight.
&gt;court now says the teen can use his estate i'm...*concerned* about the way you said "use his estate."
you know what estate means in this context, right?
but yeah, this whole thing is wild.
meant sue in hindsight that should have been obvious to me.
sorry.
no problem thanks for pointing it out!
that shit is crazy, but i guess it does make sense that a pedo would go want to see a kid's dick.
if i was that kid's lawyer, id' also be going after the judge who issued the initial warrant and the one who ok'ed the idea of sending him to a hospital for an erection shot.
none of that is ok. and the prosecutor who gave the cop the go ahead and the other three officers in the room and the supervisors that that didn't put a stop to it.
the whole thing is just surreal and it saddens me that a bunch of adults who cared more about getting a conviction than what is right let it go so far.
that's prosecutors et al.
for you and what happens when we use number of convictions as the only metric for judging prosecutors.
of course that didn’t do anything.
they all probably go to the each other’s cookouts on the weekends.
it’s an old boys club, through and through.
i remember when this happened, reddit was around, and i was fighting on here against people who were all "the law is the law" and " if put have nothing to hide show them it isn't your dick" and whatever.
man, fuck you guys, if any of you are still around here.
in their defence, it’s not like there’s no legal precedent for penis viewing to determine if someone might have committed a crime - see [scott v. flenderson](https://www.instagram.com/p/yvkjbiadrq/) so if hypothetically they had got to the point of taking the kid to the hospital for an erection injection, how would that even work?
i would hope that any nurse or doctor would refuse to give the drugs because the kid doesn't have erectile dysfunction and it's therefore not medically necessary.
i have no idea.
how do even tell a medical provider, "we gotta see this kid jerk off, you know, for justice."
i've interacted with a lot of doctors and nurses for my work.
a very high percentage of them would react to that order with "get the fuck out of this office/hospital before i call security."
&gt; in a 2-1 majority opinion, the 4th us circuit court of appeals found tuesday that the initial warrant against sims was an "obvious, unconstitutional violation."
i'd like to imagine after the vote, the two people that voted majority looked over to the third guy and were like, "the fuck man?".
[another comment in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7i6n6y/forcing_kid_to_masturbate_for_cops_in_sexting/dqwi5mp/) goes into how ridiculous that judge is.
you find out your 15 year old daughter is sexting a [17 year old] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2016/05/26/teen-in-manassas-city-sexting-case-sues-prince-william-authorities-for-civil-rights-violations/) and you call the cops.
it's just two kids in high school, fuck off and do some parenting this.
why on earth were the fucking authorities brought in the first place?
these are horny teenagers doing dumb shit.
i get mom was pissed.
but calling the cops?
she had other options before the law needed to be involved.
one should not go to police everytime you get pissed off and demand immediate vindication.
there can huge unforeseen and horrific consequences when the law gets involved for somethings that could or should of been resolved privately.
that being said, that cop would still be destroying children's lives if she didn't call the police.
not to diminish the disgusting and reprehensible behavior of the cop, the prosecutor, the judge, and the like, but this is extremely rare to find the investigating cop a pedophile who has to prove his suspect is a sex predator all the while getting off on said suspect's naked body and forced erection.
thankfully, this all came to light.
it could have ended much worse and the boy branded a sex offender for life and the cop still doing his evil shit.
this makes me believe there is still some cosmic karma still floating around there.
if porn has taught me anything, the mom should have taught her daughter a lesson by fucking her boyfriend.
poor kid is probably scarred for life, tough.
ptsd.
i mean, he was violated in a horrible manner.
imagine being forced to masturbate like that.
that must have fucked him up badly.
that’s some sick shit.
i hope someone paid a therapist for him and he went on to have a good life and a mostly normal relationship with his own body, with masturbation - and with other people.
i’d never be able to trust any potential partner again after that (or their parents).
still can’t believe what the fuck i just read in that article.
&gt; it states that the incident began when sims’ girlfriend sent nude photos of herself to him by cell phone, which the girl’s mother identified at sims’ trial in 2014. sims responded with “an explicit video of himself via his cell phone,” glasberg wrote, though abbott testified that the sender’s face was not visible.
the girl’s mother reported the video to the manassas city police.
sims was then charged with manufacturing and distributing child pornography, but the girl was not.
glasberg said richardson and abbott only charged sims because he is male, a violation of his equal protection rights.
so their solution was to create more child porn for the department for forensic analysis and research.
wow anyone else pissed off at the mother for calling the cops over a 15 year old sexting another 15 year old?
easier to call the cops than do some actual parenting.
&gt;the female, who had sent nude photos to the male, did not testify and was not charged.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/manassas-city-teen-placed-on-probation-in-sexting-case-where-police-sought-photos/2014/08/01/c4d6ff62-19ad-11e4-85b6-c1451e622637_story.html?tid=a_inl&amp;utm_term=.5b1ae78b8bbe it seems that if a girl does it, it's okay.
i wish the girl had the book thrown at her so the mommy could see real justice be served - justice is supposed to be blind to gender, right?
if a teen girl was forced to masturbate for a bunch of cops (male or otherwise) this case would have garnered national attention and these guys would be in mortal danger and unemployed.
then the disgusting police department would get the heat it truly deserves and maybe these idiots/pervs would be replaced.
edit: just want to add for clarity that i honestly think this entire thing is fucked - just like most people in this comment section.
teens sexting consensually shouldn't be anyone's business but those involved (the teens).
i personally wish the girl had been given the same treatment so the spotlight could burn a massive hole in the lives of the girl's mother, the police department, the officers involved, and the judges involved.
(in a perfect world, the state would not be in any way involved in a sexting case between to mentally stable, consenting teens of similar age.)
i get the sentiment but the girl was probably mortified and humiliated at school so the mom already screwed her some.
i’m not comparing this to what happened to the guy his treatment was obviously worse but the girlfriend is equally as innocent in doing normal 15 year old things and having the “book thrown at her” would be just as much of a misstep in justice.
the whole “sexting” craze from adults that was going on while i was in middle and high school is hopefully over for being the massive overreaction that it was.
i think he was 17 and she was 15, right?
i can't believe the kid got probation over this.
this is the most trumped-up, ridiculous shit ever.
we portray sexual relationships between teenagers every day - fuck, our literature that *we force kids to read* portrays sexual relationships between adults and children (see *the crucible*).
some of the most popular porn categories involve teachers and students, schoolgirls, etc.
how the fuck are we going to be mad when teens wind up engaging in sexual behaviors with one another, and how the fuck are we going to impose a penalty a kid for sexting someone two years younger than him when we've all but encouraged these behaviors on an institutional and social level?
never call the cops.
yeah, that stood out to me too.
what the fuck?
save the kids from engaging in consensual activities with persons of a similar age by having adults use and threaten violence to force them to commit sex acts.
simply taking a step back sheds a clear light on how fucked up the term "justice" is.
well put.
&gt;lawyers representing the abbott estate argued that their client was shielded by "qualified immunity," the notion in american law that generally protects law enforcement officers in **gray-area** situations from legal liability how the fuck is this a "gray area"?
because it was a court order, which means the court found it to be lawful at the time.
but weren't the cops the ones who asked for the court order in the first place?
the american legal system is full of so many catch 22s i am beginning to think it's intentional.
and how the hell does his estate/family keep fighting about this after everything that came out?
you now know he was a pedophile, why would you want to bring even more attention to thism money talks, morality walks everyone involved with, and with knowledge of, this entire fiasco should be looking for a new job.
i thought this was just an over-dramatic, sensationalized title.
then i read the article.
damn.
that is messed up.
http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/08/health/students-grope-drug-sweep-trnd/index.html wait what?
did i read that right?
the cop who tried to force the teenager to masturbate in front of him and his buddies committed suicide because they were going to arrest him at a later date for pedophilia?
pedo cop just wanted to see the kids dick ... and the judge was like "as long as i get to see the video" another member of the [judical jackoff club](http://www.chron.com/news/nation-world/article/judge-faces-charges-for-masturbating-during-trials-1945301.php) at what point was this kid allowed to be alone with these guys without a parent.
wouldn't they need to consent to this?
the cops somehow got a warrant, which allowed them to force him to do this as a way to gather evidence.
the court here ruled that this warrant was unconstitutional.
regardless shouldn't the legal guardian have to be present of atleast able to see what's going on?
even when they asks kids about sexual abuse the parents or whoever are allowed or have legal reasoning to be there to see the questioning, or am i wrong?
...and it takes a court of fucking law to figure this shit out?
&gt; "we cannot perceive any circumstance that would justify a police search requiring an individual to masturbate in the presence of others," and yet a judge approved and signed the warrant...that's how it works.
the cops make a request and a judge decides if it's legal, reasonable, and warranted...so where's the accountability for the judge?
it seems like judges are never held accountable.
two warrants, in fact.
the judge who approved the warrants (there were two, keep in mind.
he approved the one to make the kid perform for the officer and a second for the kid to be forcibly taken to the hospital for the shot.)
should be disbarred, especially considering what came to light about the officer that wanted to watch the kid do it.
good fucking riddance to that cop, but the judge needs to face the consequences of his actions as well.
file this one under "no shit".
roses are red, justice is blind... ...pedophile cop commits suicide after child pornography find.
r/boottoobig forcing a kid to masturbate or get a dick injection was found to be wrong, as in wasn't automatically fucking apparent?
what the fuck [deleted] so..as long as you wear a badge it's ok to sexually abuse kids?
what the actual fuck?
this country really needs to take a deep breath regarding sex.
we've become neurotic and puritanical about it, and it's become a cudgel to be abused.
become?
we've always been that way.
how is the name of the judge who signed that warrant not available information here?
even getting a warrant fr that act in the first place should be addressed.
the judge is equally if not more at fault here than the police.
my question as well.
what kind of judge would sign this warrant?
what is more fucked up in all these types of cases is that the law system allows a kid to be arrested for exchanging pictures of explicit nature with someone of the same age as himself.
the protection of child pornography is to protect kids against adults, not kids their own age.
am i the only one pissed at the girls mom, too?
your teenage daughter was exhanging sexts, so instead of talking to them like adults as to why it's a terrible idea, you call the police and try to ruin the kid's life?
what the fuck is wrong with people?
&gt; abbott then obtained a second warrant authorizing police to escort sims to a hospital for an "erection-inducing injection."
our warrant system is fucking broken.
&gt; that warrant was ostensibly part of an ongoing sexting investigation into the then-teen, trey sims, who had exchanged explicit messages with his then-15-year-old girlfriend.
her mother reported the incident to the manassas city police department in january 2014. am i missing something?
why did the police even start investigating this?
two teens are in a relationship and send nasty messages.
mom doesn't like that and calls the fucking police???
on what ground did they not say "you stupid?
we got better shit to do!"?
phew, glad that's settled!
coulda gone either way on that one.
i'm sorry, *what?
* america: the developed country with third-world cops.
was that finding somehow ever in question?
jesus... “many have expressed concern at what they believe to be an extreme measure in this type of case.
however, when a criminal defendant, adult or juvenile, decides to exercise his or her right to a trial, it is necessary for the prosecution to explore all legal avenues of evidence collection in order to prepare for trial.
while those legal avenues may be explored, they are not always pursued and are sometimes, as in this case, abandoned.” this is a quote from the original story after the teen got sentenced to probation.
http://www.insidenova.com/headlines/manassas-teen-in-high-profile-sexting-case-gets-probation/article_87b32a7c-19f1-11e4-9e29-001a4bcf887a.html what is crazy is that not one person brings up what if this was a female, would they go to this extreme measure for a female, highly doubtful.
my point would be, whoever suggested they get this guy to whip it out and get hard should be looked at, very hard, because as we all know, the people that bang the drum the loudest usually end up being involved with whatever they are rallying others to hate.
you’re right but it’s not doubtful, it’s factual.
the article said they had the girls phone too and since they took the pics on their own phone and sent them to each other’s phone they’d have identical content, but the article then states that she was neither brought it or charged.
the issue was that they were creating and distributing “child pornography” and in this scenario it takes two to tango so they’re both on legally equal footing.
and yet, she walks scott free and he became a pedo cops new toy.
who we should be angry with is internal affairs, isn’t their whole existence to watch the watchers?
so things like unreasonable and immoral requests aren’t made, then granted by warrant, then carried out, with no oversight?
if it’s 1 bad apple, it’s that persons fault, if every apple is bad, it’s managements fault.
holding a child at gunpoint and forcing them to perform sexual acts should get you imprisoned for a very long time and put on a watchlist.
how is this a question?
forcing anyone to masturbate is wrong.
what year is it?
i'm so glad this court finally cleared this question up.
i was really on the fence for this one...... /s &gt; forcing kids to masturbate is wrong ya' think?
this story is bat shit crazy.
detective gets order to force teen to masturbate so he can compare with pic teen sent to his underage gf.
then detective gets busted for unrelated pedofilia charges and commits suicide.
basically this detective pursued this case just so he could get off.
ufb.
glad he's dead.
i had assumed this was going to be a /r/nottheonion sub.
a.k.a.
no shit sherlock.
circle of obvious ignorance that nobody notices.
interesting.
wait they need a court of appeals to decide that wtf.
the one guy said it was okay should we look into that guy?
the courts just found that out?
oh wow, i knew that one right away, and i am sickened by the idea of it.
feel like this should be from "the onion."
what fuckery logic makes that in any way okay?
i read the title in mr. mackey's voice.
forcing kids to masturbate is wrong, mmkay?
what the hell?
how does the judge who originally okay-ed not have their name plastered for all to see?
i think "the court finds" is the wrong term here.
it should be "the court *points out, with an irritated look on its face because the idea is so fucking obvious that even having to explain it to something is offensive to the very idea of human life on this planet*."
a court had to call that out... insane yeah.
let’s just add that to the “no shit sherlock” list you brain dead morons.
is the onion leaking or is the world literally starting to crash and burn at a faster and faster pace i don't know what sort of ethics medics in the us have to adhere to in such situations, but here in the uk, if i was asked to do something like that, i would tell the police where to go.
i have a feeling this would get 10 times the attention if the victim was a girl instead.
this was a 2-1 case.
in what way in this god-damned word is there 4th circuit court judge that thinks it's ok for cops to make an underage kid masturbate and in front of others and protect them under qualified immunity?
not to mentioned a judge said to himself i'll sign a warrant so a cop can watch a boy masturbate.
wtf.
without the video, this murderer would still be on the streets doing god knows what.
he gunned an unarmed man down who was literally running for his life.
we now know the man he shot knew the cop and knew his character.
obviously he was running for a reason.
he felt he was going to die, and he did.
i think the worse part about this was that a jury still couldn't convict him.
that's just embarrassing.
one juror absolutely refused to convict, the rest were on the fence: https://www.today.com/news/walter-scott-shooting-jury-foreman-explains-how-michael-slager-case-t105742 the jury had one african american, the rest were white.
i wonder why so many were undecided?
the prosecutor even gave them other options besides murder to cover their bases.
&gt; asked about why the lone juror refused to budge about a not guilty verdict, montgomery would not elaborate.
&gt; “he just had his own convictions, and i’ll leave that right there,” he said.
yeah, i wonder what those "convictions" were... well, that's the power of jury nullification for ya, reddit's own venerated legal concept.
disagree with a law or something?
refuse to convict, give no reason.
jurors can vote based on anything and do crazy shit and it is still upheld.
if you want to get really crazy you should read [tanner v. united states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tanner_v._united_states) where a verdict was upheld even thought a lot of the jury was fucked up the whole time.
&gt;after the defendant was found guilty of mail fraud, his attorneys filed several motions in which it was discovered that seven of the jurors drank alcohol during the noon recess.
four jurors consumed between them "a pitcher to three pitchers" of beer during various recesses.
[1] of the three other jurors who were alleged to have consumed alcohol, one stated that, on several occasions, he observed two jurors having one or two mixed drinks during the lunch recess, and one other juror, who was also the foreperson, having a liter of wine on each of three occasions.
juror hardy also stated that he and three other jurors smoked marijuana quite regularly during the trial.
moreover, hardy stated that, during the trial, he observed one juror ingest cocaine five times and another juror ingest cocaine two or three times.
one juror sold a quarter pound of marijuana to another juror during the trial, and took marijuana, cocaine, and drug paraphernalia into the courthouse.
one of the jurors described himself to juror hardy as "flying."
and i'll continue to defend it.
a basic tenant of our system that's seemingly been forgotten is that it's better to have ten guilty people go free than one innocent person punished.
what makes you think this was jury nullification?
it isn't necessarily, it just sounds like it- or rather, this is the safest form for jn to take and there's no way to tell.
if you sit on guilty/not guilty and refuse to budge, especially if you don't give any real explanation, there's a good chance you're not open to logic/convincing and are basing your decision on something other than the law.
even if you don't convince the rest of the jury, your individual action is still effectively nullifying any potential guilty ruling (bar the judge declaring a mistrial/hung jury and sending the case to a different jury).
better man that i would have been.
if someone did that in the face of the video evidence we had, i'd call them right out on their "convictions" so the whole world knew.
the same guy who stabilized the video made a documentary following the hype surrounding the video.
[frame 394](https://youtu.be/gzsb00oszuy) christ.
he didn't warn, didn't pull his taser instead, didn't even try to make pursuit.
what a psychopath.
agreed.
his taser was supposedly knocked from his hand according to the documentary, but still doesn't justify shooting at someone 8 times.
&gt; but still doesn't justify shooting at someone 8 times.
it's not the number of shots that is in question here....it's that he was shot in the back while running away.
too often people focus on the number of shots.
that's a mistake.
it's very hard, arguably impossible, to override the fight-or-flight aspect of the brain when it comes to deadly force.
now, before anyone downvote me based on cop-sympathizing......don't.
i'm pretty strictly critical of police-involved shootings.
it comes down to base-level brain function.when you get into a life or death situation...whether real or perceived.....the brain takes over.
you go into, for lack of a better term, a trance-like state.
the better trained you are...the better your actions can be mitigated...but when the metal hits the meat....you're on auto-pilot.
whether mr. scott was shot 2 times or 15 times is basically irrelevant.
the relevant part is that he was shot in the back while running away.
that's where the training &amp; intent matters.
again...for the record, it is my opinion that mr. scott was executed....murdered.
so let there be no mistake on my feelings of this shooting.
i still think he should've gotten at least 30 years.
the fact that slager seems to have attempted to cover up what happened (placing his taser next to the body) should have made this a life sentence.
we really need stronger deterrence against police coverups.
what i find most disturbing in the video is how casually slager picks up the taser and moves it next to him.
i mean, he didn't run over and check on him, or anything.
i panic more than that when i spill a glass of water.
how endemic must this behavior be if you can be that casual about it?
it's like he'd done it before.
casual indifference, that's the phrase that comes to mind about the murder of scott.
true.
i'm shocked (though pleasantly surprised) that even this murderer is facing justice.
honestly i expected him to get the same treatment as the rest - fired, slap on the wrist, and a new job in a few weeks in the next county over.
i'm glad slager will do time.
hopefully he meets some people inside who do not look kindly on murderous racists who put on a badge so they could bully people.
yeah that was pretty terrifying honestly, like recently i've been delving into true crime stories and listening to some of the serial killer interviews from prison and btk stuck out, he was just so fucking nonchalant and casual about tying these people up and choking them death like he was just having small talk about the weather or a sports game 19 years is a really long time.
19 years ago, i was in high school.
my life has changed 5 times over since then and can’t imagine if i was in a cage that entire time.
his life as he knows it is over and he might not even make it to see that 19th year.
i agree, and i think a scandinavian model of justice and prison is probably the way to go, but given america's history and deep political divisions it's more likely that we get universal healthcare than a re-examination of crime and punishment.
i suppose i think a life sentence here is appropriate only in relation to sentences for other crimes.
sadly, i fear that the stated goals of prison (removal, deterrence, rehabilitation) play second fiddle to the unstated racist goal of removing as many minority men from society as possible.
where's the video?
i am new to the case.
https://vimeo.com/124336782 it blows me away that his first *immediate* instinct was not to chase, but pull out his firearm and shoot the man.
he didn't hesitate for even a moment before grabbing his gun.
i feel like if someone makes a break for it, my immediate thought, after registering that they ran, would be to chase.
lazy fuck would rather kill someone than run a few yards.
he wasn't lazy, he was power tripping.
it's clear from the video in how calm he is faking the evidence.
he wanted to kill walter scott.
i wonder how much of police training hours are spent on shooting and target practice?
it was just so blatant they couldn't fabricate the usual bullshit excuses - they had no outs on this so they had no choice but to let him face appropriate charges without the benefit of the prosecution deliberately throwing the case.
also the union seems quite a bit weaker in sc than in ny - the pba guys will defend literally anything, no matter how heinous the circumstances or significant the evidence.
make no mistake, they had as much to do with many of the obscene exonerations as any other party involved.
that’s right!
however, in the case of eric garner, that shit was also videotaped and went viral.
i still don’t understand how those cops were exonerated.
i’m white, but i’m not stupid.
the cops in that situation had no call to use such excessive force on that man.
and then, when he told them he couldn’t breathe, they just let him die.
can't wait for the inevitable "but he was selling loose cigarrets and that's a͈̬̮̰͎̤͙̿͂̄̂͠͡ͅg̶̠̦̖̊ͧͭ̆̀aͤͨͩ̋͏̛̜̭ͅi̛̖̖̗̦̻̤͐̐͌ͦ̀n̗̟̔̿͌ͮ͟͡s̯̫̺̙̥̊ͬ͋̉ͯ̓̔͢t̴̨͈̰̥̫̤͓̄̀ ͖͖ͩ̎̍͒͋t̡̠̻̥͍̣̱̐͠hͥ̑̅̆ͩ́͞҉̯̹͓̞͖ẽ̡̧̟͈ ̛͉̭̬̠̮͕̻̌̄͂͜l͕̮͍͔̒͢ǎ̡͕̖̯̳͓̣̮̌̈́̑̉͗͡ͅw̛̻̗̼̼͇̱ͣ̌̌́."
as though so fucking minor an infraction as selling fucking cigarettes even warrants an immediate, forceful arrest.
fuck's sake.
we're one of the most advanced nations in the world.
our cops should be tasked with having a *basic* sense of proportional response.
you don't fucking need 4 (or was it more?)
cops to take down a guy for selling god damn loose cigarettes.
yes, i know they were there because there was a fight and they were trying to get info about it out of him, but come the fuck on.
confiscate his cigarettes, give him a court date, and move the fuck on with your day.
he wasn't even doing that at the time.
he just had a previous ticket on his record for selling loose cigarettes but they somehow spun it into this bullshit.
could you imagine being brutally murdered by a cop for no good reason and then it being justified because you had a speeding ticket on your record from years prior?
(is it snark time?
i think it's snark time.)
i can indeed empathize with black people enough to imagine how horrible that experience would be.
bonus points if you're killed by that cop for *someone else's* warrant because you matched the description with your """broad nose""".
this is where prejudice comes in to play, because selling loose cigarettes in the eyes of many seems like a "thuggish" thing to do.
just like with the hoodie for trayvon, it seemed like a good play to diminish his character and make his death justifyable somehow.
when i smoked, if you bum a cig, you best have a dollar bill.
yes because it's nypd.
they're basically a mercenary army to protect the value of all that real estate.
right!
for god’s sake!
like the man was hurting somebody!
smoking kills.
eric garner was slowly murdering members of his own community.
why isn't anybody talking about the prevalence of selling loosies and other black-on-black violence!
/s &gt; however, in the case of eric garner, that shit was also videotaped and went viral.
i still don’t understand how those cops were exonerated.
oh, i understand how it happened.
law and order.
the people are represented by two separate yet equally important groups; the police who investigate crime and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders.
notice an absence of justice in there?
the da and the police view themselves as being on the same team.
they work closely together and they work for the same goal; conviction rates.
even with that video, the da can guide a grand jury either way.
the most egregious grand jury abuse i have seen involved those georgia cops who disfigured a baby with a flashbang.
cops went before the grand jury and were cleared.
read their report.
they felt they weren't tasked with criminal prosecution.
they're job, as they understood it, was to make recommendations so that this sort of accident didn't happen again in the future.
that's exactly what they did, they presented a big list of suggestions instead of prosecuting the animals that nearly killed a child.
seems disingenuous to compare a case where the cop was deliberately shooting someone to kill them vs a situation where there was absolutely no intent to kill anyone well, ok, garner obviously had health issues.
i get that.
but like the previous commentor stated- they used an unreasonable amount of force in this case.
i don’t think that can even be argued.
i’ve seen this video a few times and don’t even see how it got to the point the police felt they had to bring him down.
they're both use of force.
and they're both unjust uses of force.
just so we're clear, you were in pantaleos mind?
you know his intent for a fact or are you talking the officer's self-serving claim that he never wanted garner to die while he choked him to death?
and after choking him, the police then refused to perform medical assistance to help garner, while the intent is debatable the results are not.
police killed this man through hate or incompetence but it was probably both.
&gt;appropriate charges he was charged with obstruction of justice and unlawful use of his weapon.
he took a plea deal and plead guilty to deprivation of rights and had the obstruction (lying about fighting for his taser) and unlawful use of his weapon (literally killing scott) charges dropped.
when he actually had "appropriate charges" i.e.
the murder charge (second degree murder is defined as intentional murder with malice, but not premeditated.
he didn't plan to kill scott that day, but shooting a man who was running away who *actually* feared for his life?
that's intentional.
and the planting of the taser to make it seem like the shooting was necessary shows the malice because he's fabricating the scenario and then to lying to the police department), it resulted in a mistrial.
somehow the jury was deadlocked.
as if [shooting an unarmed man in the back as he runs away](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/07/shooting_of_walter_scott.jpeg) is such a confusing and complex situation where it's impossible to come to a conclusion.
if there was video evidence of that and it *didn't* involve a cop, the judge and jury would have thrown 3 books at the shooter.
[this is unconfirmed.
it is not true.
#michaelslager has not yet been sentenced.
those are just the guidelines the judge said he'd use.
he also can sentence completely outside of them.
#walterscott] (https://twitter.com/megkinnardap/status/938804444669644800) i mean, the judge is likely going to do what he said he was going to do... right?
well, i just got the update, and slager was sentenced by the judge to 20 years.
so it seems the judge did just what they said they would do... he did!
should have been way more in my opinion.
slager still gets out in time to be with his family, something walter scott's family can't do.
oh, michael slager is definitely getting a reduced sentence for murder because he did it while wearing a cop's uniform.
that is terrible, and that kind of thing must end.
murder is murder, and cops ought to be held to a higher standard, not a lower one.
correction issued.
[correction: former south carolina police officer michael slager faces 19 to 24 years in prison for shooting death of walter scott.]
(https://twitter.com/abc/status/938805791863304192) [judge sentences michael slager to 20 years.
](http://abcnews.go.com/us/cop-michael-slager-faces-19-24-years-prison/story?id=51595376) any bets on when he actually gets out?
i'm guessing some time before 2037.
&gt; the pba guys will defend literally anything, no matter how heinous the circumstances or significant the evidence didn't they throw that one young rookie under the bus?
never forget that before the footage got out reddit was all in saying how the cop was justified in shooting him.
i dont remember that.
i remember people saying they were hoping it wasnt another travesty.
what subreddits do you hang out on?
r/protectandserve was all over defending this guy, though they'll defend anyone with a badge regardless of how guilty, so i guess they don't really count.
just checked out that sub now, looking for their reaction to slager's sentence.
currently, it seems as they are also disgusted by slager's behavior and thought a guilty verdict was correct.
they may have been defending him before the footage, and been wrong then, but currently, they seem to be against him, along with every reasonable person who's seen the footage matched up with the police scanner.
they clearly would be against this.
they are not complete idiots.
i don't know what that guy is about.
does he really think cops go online and admit that they think it's fine to kill unarmed people?
no matter what they really think no police mod would ever allow them to spew this kind of bullshit online.
of course they will.
they defend any scum who puts on a uniform that should remind them of the higher standards they should be subject to for wanting to put on that uniform.
reddit is full of bias.
those twerps are especially nasty, but not unique.
&gt; reddit was all in saying any time i see someone assert "reddit" did a thing or said a thing or supported a thing or protested a thing, i safely ignore that comment, because "reddit" is not a single individual with opinions.
if we used your logic on you, well, you're a transsexual, a racist, a furry, a politician, bill nye the sex junk guy, ea, and net neutrality.
because i've seen all those things on reddit, so that's what you must be, i guess.
actually i'm a black man over 40 yrs old so i'm very different from the hive mind types that come here.
i also don't ever come to reddit for news because i also saw how much this place fucked up when it came to the boston bombers.
if people come here for news and commentary, they'll eventually internalize these ideas into their beliefs.
it may not be intentional, and you may even have a discerning eye for bullshit, but the hive mind does have an impact on people.
just curious, i argued recently that "cops" aren't a thing.
officers are just people with similar training and job descriptions.
their beliefs, abilities and levels of competence vary by the individual.
i was lambasted, of course.
so after reading your comment about reddit...can you agree that this also applies to "cops"?
absolutely.
you and i would likely agree on a lot, given that.
&gt;reddit was all in saying cause you're the only individual here and the rest of us are some kind of borg entity.
i already forgot so i could use a refresher.
please cite a thread from a major sub where this happened.
thanks.
wow i'm pleasantly surprised.
we actually have a semblance of justice.
he hasn't been sentenced yet, these are just guidelines.
just an fyi, i don't know when it got updated, but it now says he was sentenced to 20 years, of the possible 19-24 he was sentenced to 20 years.
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/07/us/michael-slager-sentence-walter-scott.html he was facing life.
oh okay.
i was confused by the headline.
my apologies - it's my first submission to /r/news, and when the article appeared, it definitely said "sentenced to 19-24 years."
abc news has since edited the headline to the more correct, "...faces 19-24 years."
i thought the sentence had been determined, which i thought was news-worthy.
i guess we'll see what mr. slager actually gets sentenced to soon... 25 years for blatant murder seems a bit light.
i thought that was the standard.
even considered harsh by other nations standards, not that i agree 25 years is pretty much what you get de facto in most western countries for "regular" murders.
things get iffy because the us considers a lot of homicides "murder" (usually second degree) that would usually result in some form of manslaughter pretty much anywhere else.
no felony-murder-rule either.
20 years for civil rights violations (federal).
that's not a bad day for justice.
20 years is the max sentence in texas for some murders.
&gt; 20 years is the max sentence in texas for some murders.
which murders are those?
most people that commit **murder** in texas and are convicted get the needle.
it was pursuant to a plea agreement.
he faced life.
yea, but still a *semblance* of justice.
i was expecting him to get &lt; 5. it wasn't premeditated.
at least no evidence of it that's due to a plea deal.
his max would have been life imprisonment i think 20 years is still too short, but i'll take what we can get.
he was allowed to plead guilty to violating scott's civil rights.
he should have been made to stand trial for murder.
he did stand trial for murder.
one dumbass juror refused to convict, so it was a mistrial (11-1).
i know, but another trial was scheduled but he was allowed to plead before it started.
keep in mind folks that this case resulted in a hung jury.
clear video evidence.
clear attempt at a cover up.
still resulted in a jury going "hmmm maybe he didn't commit murder.".
it is a small victory that he's being sentenced to 20 years after a guilty plea which dropped a couple of other charges against him, but it's also a reminder that even when there is clear, indisputable evidence and a cover-up, police still will not be convicted by their peers.
rip walter scott.
fun fact: in dutch his surname, that being 'slager', *actually* means **butcher**.
fitting... go read the comments on this mistrial from a year ago if you wanna laugh at people who are clueless about our justice system.
all the officers who tried to help fabricate a cover story need to be in prison with slager.
[deleted] well, i suppose it's that it was recorded on video, which went viral, and seemed to clearly show walter scott running away from the officer, and get shot several times directly in the back.
the context of the video showed that walter scott was no threat at all, running very weakly away.
scott's death-penalty offense?
broken tail light.
the real difference is that officer slager was fired, and is now sentenced to 19-24 years in prison.
that seems rare for police (to actually be convicted).
&gt; well, i suppose it's that it was recorded on video, which went viral, and seemed to clearly show walter scott running away from the officer, and get shot several times directly in the back.
it also showed the cop moving the tazer next to scott's body.
being caught staging the scene to match his description (scott grabbed his tazer, so he fired in self-defense) cast everything the cop said in a very poor light and everything snowballed from there.
keep in mind they *still* couldn't get a state court conviction on this; the first trial ended in a mistrial and the retrial was pending until he pleaded guilty to the federal charges.
the state, apparently, is not pursuing its case further.
all because *one* asshole juror refused to convict.
11-1. that person probably never votes to convict a cop.
pretty sure the juror admitted that he'd never vote to convict a police officer never should have been on the jury.
disgraceful.
it was simply so blatant, and the entire incident was recorded.
people often look for any excuse to defend the police, but there simply wasn't one in this case.
castile is as blatant as it gets in my eyes.
this case was equally as blatant.
but he was reaching for his gun!
...after calmly telling the officer he had a cc weapon in his car...and after the officer asked for his info.
i think you forgot to put a "/s" at the end... one juror found an excuse of some sort at the mistrial.
someone up thread is trying.
just watch the video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynoi3ke-odw better quality video [on vimeo](https://vimeo.com/124336782) scott's family also received $6.5 million in a civil settlement from the city of north charleston.
at least some justice came out of this tragic event.
money can't bring him back to life.
they should have used civil forfeiture to seize **criminal** slager's possessions and money to subsidize the payment.
additionally his retirement account should have been drained for this.
i don't know, doing something like that seems super fucked up /s i get that money doesn't hurt the family further, but neither will it do anything to return the life of walter scott.
my father died in 2013, and if someone gave me $6.5 million and said i could have him back for even a few moments in exchange, i wouldn't hesitate for a second.
finding meaning in this crazy world is hard enough, and relationships with other people are the closest thing i've ever found... get money from the taxpayers that were probably just as appalled as the rest of us..... every time i see the "at that expense of the taxpayers" on police shooting settlements i always respond with "good."
maybe once enough of your tax money goes towards unfucking the wrongdoings of the police, taxpayers will be a bit more proactive about voting for politicians who enable it.
this needs to get pushed all the way up.
accountability has to be made widespread and see what a working system looks like.
finally, some fucking justice in this racist ass country.
"i feared for my life when the man ran in the completely opposite direction!"
get fucked scumbag.
with clear video evidence... you’re a cop: 20 years anyone else: life were it your average human being committing murder, the sentence would be life without parole.
still a 2 tier justice system.
&gt; were it your average human being committing murder, the sentence would be life without parole.
... you sure?
never heard of anyone committing murder and not getting life in prison?
this is evidence that we need to deport right wing racist cops.
if this racist cop wasn’t in this country, this poor victim would sill be alive.
it’s shameful that the flyover state shitholes have become sanctuary cities for racist murderous cops.
thank you to the person who recorded that murder.
otherwise, the murderer would still be in uniform, still committing crimes against citizens.
even with it being super cut and dry i wonder how pissed people on r/protectandserve are there's no mention of it whatsoever.
it's the top thread right now and it was posted immediately after the actual sentence was handed out.
i just clicked on the thread link and the top comment is "good, he got lucky that he only got 20. deserves life."
i don't know if it was an leo posting that though so take from that what you will.
that doesn't really fit with the circlejerk though.
i am jacks complete lack of surprise.
good, finally some sort of justice.
it is rather refreshing to see a lying, dirty, (ex)cop get his due.
too bad the other cops that kill unarmed people are given a free pass, and keep their jobs.
let this be a lesson to the cops who willfully commits misconduct throughout this nation.
this garbage cop should have gotten the death sentence.
garbage committed a crime, try to cover it up, all while being a public servant who the citizen of this could try put trust on him.
but this is better than him walking free though.
maybe this cop grew up watching too many black and white movies.
it's almost comical in old cinema where a cop's first reaction to a fleeing suspect is to draw his gun and unleash a hail of bullets, and it really doesn't matter how insignificant the suspected crime is, either.
i have no idea who you are, but you saw me and started to run?
stop in the name of the law!
*bang bang bang* acutal justice.
holy shit [worth a look.
](https://www.shortoftheweek.com/2016/05/14/frame-394/) i watched this a while ago and it really changed how i view this case.
it definitely is worth a look cop fucked up.
usually these guys just get suspended with pay.
another trump pardon?
wasn't federal so no.
dear god.
anyone else that's not a cop would've gotten life without parole.
i would like to assume that if there was no video, he wouldve still gotten sentenced.
i mean, they wouldve noticed he was shot in the back from 20ft right after looking at the wounds?
first trial was a hung jury lol even with the video i heard it was 1 person who refused to convict outright [deleted] in the back 5 times that's correct.
probably someone who has cop family members.
i'm convinced he was the ringer cherry-picked by the da's office.
multiple gunshot wounds to the back.
worst case of suicide the coroner's ever seen.
real shame, it is.
open and shut case johnson.
just sprinkle some crack on him.
no.
https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2012/08/20/159416070/death-of-handcuffed-man-in-police-car-ruled-a-suicide handcuffed.
searched twice.
suicide.
well, if we're the police then who will police the police?
ionno.
coastguard?
this guy gets it ^ honestly i doubt it.
i think the falsified police report and video is what did it.
&gt; the falsified police report tangential, *but* keep this case in mind when you're looking up stats on police killings.
most of these stats are based on police self-reports.
when a killing is reported as "justified" think about what happened to walter scott.
nope.
in the 3 days before the video was released a *whopping* 3 newspapers (all local charleston papers) reported on the story and all of them just copied the police report verbatim in their retelling of the story.
no no it's 5 warning shots in the back /s lol.
you know how common it is for these things to be covered up and give a slap on the wrist?
i'm actually surprised that even with the video anything happened.
that's good news.
you mean, when they find the body covered in pistols and cocaine, and a koran and some kiddie porn?
yeah, they probably would have figured it out.
&gt;i would like to assume that if there was no video, he wouldve still gotten sentenced.
you assume wrong.
slager immediately tried to plant his taser near scott's downed body.
with no video his bullshit account would have probably been enough to say it was a clean shoot.
even an exact record doesn't always help.
there was an audio of the kelly thomas murder.
look it up if you think you can stomach it.
[i wouldn't count on it.
](http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article188145129.html) i think that a lot of white peoples' eyes are being opened up as to how police really operate.
and from your extremely optimistic and somewhat naive comment, i can tell you're white.
white and black doesn't matter for the article.
what does matter is that clear picture of walter scott running away and michael slager shooting him in the back when walter scott doesn't present a danger to another person.
now that this one is done can we please get mohammed noor on trial?
&gt; now that this one is done can we please get mohammed noor on trial?
all this time and i don't think they've even taken a fucking statement from this guy.
disgraceful.
the police union is still probably working with their lawyers testing legal theories on mock juries to see what will seem most believable to avoid a murder charge.
and over at r/protectandserve , utter silence.
i just submitted the link there.
perhaps it will stimulate discussion.
damn, murdered because of back child support.
i generally don't support the death penalty but it is warranted in this case.
shame he will be in protective custody.
proud of my home state for this.
other places have obfuscated and protected bad cops but sc did what was right.
lol bullshit.
this is a federal trial that just convicted him, because your state had a hung jury over the original murder charge.
nothing to be proud of that the feds had to step in and do your job for you looks like he just got sentenced to 20 years by the judge... still wasn't set free like so many bad cops are.
edit: apparently he plead guilty so there was no trial and the judge assigned a punishment.
it's terrifying what police have gotten away with before the proliferation of smartphones.
this is steve jobs' true legacy.
weird, they actually sent a white cop to jail for killing an unarmed black man.
granted, it was for less time than he deserves, but it is something.
"the judge's decision comes after slager, who is white" this obviously had to be mentioned..... either fuck this guy, have fun being an ex cop in jail [deleted] we still have it in some states
&gt;starnes says the father isn’t facing charges and that he “really saved the day and protected a lot of people.” i love a happy ending.
this is why asian massage parlors are so popular.
lot of shooting going on?
something certainly gets shot, a load of it you could say.
face it you had to see this joke cumming.
you used too many puns, you jerkoff!
turn over prease.
you spelled "please" wong me no rikey your comment.
this is a happy ending, but let's all be real here: the father is pretty damn lucky.
instead of making the safe move and just handing over money and having the gunman leave, he risked his and everyone else's life by making a stand.
had the gunman reacted to the father pulling a weapon and he started panic firing, innocent people could have been killed over whatever small sum of money he had on him.
the father himself could have missed and shot someone else in the melee of two people shooting at each other.
fortunately this time ended well, and we all love to see a violent criminal scumbag eat a bullet, but honestly just handing over the money would have been a lot safer for everyone involved.
there's no guarantee the guy wouldn't have shot him after he handed him the money, either.
there's plenty of cases where after the guy gets the cash he just shoots the victim.
sometimes they shoot you first then take it.
people think a murder charge is a deterrent.
it isn't what you do know is this guy has a gun and is committing a felony against you with it.
he can shoot and kill you.
he's using the threat of lethal force to get you to do something.
that's what you should base your actions in the moment on, rather than gamble on 'maybe he won't' you can what if all day, what if after he'd gotten the money dude wants more and thinks someone is holding out on them and gets violent anyways.
i know this is reddit but if you're going to armchair analyze do yourself a favor and try not to talk like you know what you're talking about.
true, but you are forgetting the deterrence value.
the next would-be armed robber will think twice.
i doubt the future deterrence value played much into this guys decision making process in the moment.
i suppose.
but really, someone dumb or desperate enough to do such a stupid crime probably isn't considering many factors like that.
not sure why the down votes.
a general rule is *don't draw on a pointed weapon*.
i agree, the safer play would have been compliance.
maybe he saw an opening and seized it.
i'm glad it worked out for this good guy with a gun this time though.
could have easily gone south.
that's why it's important to practice your draw often, for a moment's opportunity to seize there are any number of robberies in which the victim complies with the robber's demand and is shot anyway.
robbers are rational actors, but their reasoning stems from a basic premise that other human lives have no value.
all wild conjecture.
if we are thinking on things that could have happened then i say the father acted perfectly, had he done nothing the bad guy would have killed everyone present to eliminate all witnesses.
&gt;he risked his and everyone else's life by making a stand.
no, the criminal did that when he decided to victimize innocent people.
&gt; instead of making the safe move and just handing over money you mean the move that gets people killed all the time?
ask the multiple gas station clerks with holes in their heads how often just handing the money over works.
everything you have said revolves around multiple failures that just plain didn't happen, the man reacted in the moment and executed perfectly, full stop.
you can comply and change your mind after if the circumstances change.
always look for an opening.
sounds like this guy saw and seized his opening before he had to comply.
play the what if game all you want.
more law abiding citizens are doing this and winning because they train and know how to use their firearm and shoot correctly.
&gt;the gunman demanded money and, when the father refused, the gunman turned his weapon toward the man’s family.
at that point, the father, who is licensed to carry a firearm, pulled out his own gun and fired.

how dumb do you have to be to threaten people with a gun in texas?
like aren't a shit load of people packing?
gun-toting texas is kind of an outdated stereotype.
only about 5% of adult texans are licensed to carry, which is about average for the country and well under some other states like florida, washington, and tennessee.
people who think texas is all gun-nut rednecks haven't visited recently to see what a melting pot it's become over the years.
i worked in texas and it may feel like alot more than 5% but then you realize how fucking big texas is.
now living in florida...... so many people are packing.
that's because floridaman is a big threat down there.
as is tradition hmm.
worked in florida.
everyone on my team had guns (6 people).
worked in houston the next summer.
everyone in my team there also had guns (5 people).
the twist, you work for a swat team.
seriously though, what do you do where 100% of a team carries guns on the job?
i work on a base, lots of people with guns; loe only though, in the hospital itself, all weapons are prohibited except loe, so it's weird to me.
also, would be weird if every other programmer on my team had a cc.
edit: there are a couple people that take some serious chances.
one guy regularly carries a machete, and another has a couple guns in his truck.
i don't think either of these are kosher for contractors to be carrying on base, but at least they don't bring them in the building.
if they get spot checked at the gates, they could be in some serious trouble, or at least a bit.
could lose their cac.
they weren't allowed to have guns on the job, but they all owned multiple guns.
i worked at kennedy space center and johnson space center !
though everyone on both teams were fairly close knit, so i'm assuming the one gun enthusiast that was there got everyone else into it.
are you a police officer?
haha, an engineer !
if i lived in texas, i definitely would go for the concealed carry license, just because i can.
i've only seen maybe 3 people open carry since the law past https://www.gunstocarry.com/concealed-carry-statistics/ i mean the stereotype that everyone has a gun in texas is kinda dying.
not saying a lot don't have it, but plenty of other states are more pro 2a than texas.
really fucking dumb and they're everywhere.
am also texan and can confirm.
confused by the other comments saying it's just a stereotype and not true.
i'm in austin, the city one is probably least likely to see guns in public in, and i see people with them holstered regularly.
there are 5 people in my department, two conceal and carry.
don't know what it is like now, but at one time it wasn't.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luby%27s_shooting score one for us responsible gun owners.
responsibility!
only use said gun when needed.
this is a good one for /r/dgu i’m not sure you want to keep score... [deleted] not quite what you'd call a 'responsible' one, though.
i think it's a net zero sum, given the fact that a guy with a gun was threatening a family in a restaurant.
and if he came in the restaurant with a machete or a knife, are we supposed to have hoped that somebody else was carrying a samurai sword or a katana?
challenge him to an honorable duel to the death then attack him with dual steak knives from the kitchen duh a restaurants steak knives are rarely sharper then the butter knives i work in a pizza place so my experience with steak knives is about 0 that would be worse, dull knives tear rather than cut.
that'd be a nasty wound.
i got a wwi pioneer bayonet.
it's 24" long with a saw on the back.
that's a nasty wound.
&gt; and if he came in the restaurant with a machete or a knife, are we supposed to have hoped that somebody else was carrying a samurai sword or a katana?
long blades and martial arts weapons in general are felony caries in most states and cities.
you can get a concealed gun permit, but good luck getting a permit to carry your katana.
legal in texas, i think.
correct, you can open carry blades, including swords in texas.
just don't walk around with a pair of chucks or a tonfa edit to add......have been closely associated with arrests for chucks in sa tx from a front yard.
you local regulations may vary.
how about collapsible batons?
usually also illegal and classified as bludgeons, even in more permissive states.
again check your local laws.
kickass 3:texas justice???
yes..it just passed recently all those years studying the blade for nothing.
:( the life of the blade choose you.
you dont choose it it was a fast food restaurant, not a beni hana, so no problem there.
oh sure, just completely discount the awesomeness of spork fights.
not at all, there was only one responsible gun owner there and *he dun gud*.
a gun just saved a families life.
guns don't save people.
people save people.

&gt; guns don't save people.
people save people.
i love this phrase.
i'm glad it went well, it could have very easily went wrong, the robber could have shot the father when he realize he was moving.. thank god for well trained gun owner.
from a gun, sure.
surprised to see a pro-gun article in /r/news that isn't heavily downvoted despite the best possible outcome having occurred.
well, this and the concealed carry reciprocity article.
https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7i39s5/house_passes_concealed_carry_reciprocity_act/ edit: which seems to have mysteriously disappeared without being deleted.
yep, quite awhile ago.
it was on the front page of r/news and then... poof.
the majority of the comments were in support of it so i guess that's why it had to go bye bye.
waiting for this one to follow the same fate... i'm respectfully on the opposite side, opposing it, but i agree that's its retarded that the article just up and disappeared.
it's was just a press release from the nra, so it got taken off the front page for "analysis/opinion".
i'm surprised it stayed up as long as it did.
isn't it weird how rational people support people who do rational things?
maybe those gunmen who shoot up churches and schools deserve an angry mob?
butttt thats just me.
that isn't what he's talking about.
lmao is there some other r/news that im not aware of?
this sub is massively pro gun there was a ccw reciprocity story earlier that disappeared quick.
i just noticed that.
really, reddit?
[link](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7i39s5/house_passes_concealed_carry_reciprocity_act/) for anyone that didn't see it before it was disappeared.
the mods don't want the nra getting traffic someone moved it to the opinion section.
really fucking crafty if you ask me well, a story about a bill passing the house is obviously not actually news, it's just an opinion that it happened...or something... /s if a story is about amazon buying whole foods and it is written by ap, then it is news.
if it is a story about amazon buying whole foods and it is from the amazon web site, it isn't news; it is pr.
why would you think that the nra is a news source?
you say that like it's a bad thing.
/r/politics in out in force.
they're salty over al franken.
30 democrat senators demanded franken's resignation.
who exactly do you think is salty and why?
doubt it, probably salty moore hasn't been removed yet, least the dems cleaned out the trash.
moore will win, gop will force him to resign and appoint strange... the guy trump originally supported in the primaries.
i'll bet a months pay, that moore will not be forced out.
he will happily finish his term.
is that how it works?
would it be an appointment by the governor or a special election?
what makes you say that.
way to many people still support him.
support gets you elected, but it can't keep you in office if you get impeached.
i think they have to run a special elections.
they don't have the stones to remove him.
yeah that thread has dissolved into a shitshow really fast.
one of my comments was sitting at around -7 the past 2 hours.
it jumped to -50 the next time i checked.
all i did was link to a list of some 20 prominent republicans denouncing roy moore in reaction to a statement franken made that said he had the full support of all republicans.
holy hell, they descended upon that thread and destroyed it.
what are you talking about, i see fatal dgus on /r/news all the fucking time, and in every single gun related thread here that's not a mass shooting, anything remotely pro gun control gets downvoted to fucking oblivion.
hell i can think of four examples to make it to /r/news in the past month alone, and i'm sure there were more.
4*12 = 48 on average a year, and there are only about 250 justified homicides a year in the country.
if you commit a justified homicide in the us you literally have a +20% chance of making it to /r/news.
that's a pretty fucking massive bias for pushing stories like this to the top.
if 18% of murders made it to /r/news we'd see over 6 articles about murder a day here.
not all dgu are legally called justifiable homicide in crime stats.
it's a recording issue.
many are seen by police and da as justified, the person is never charged, etc... but it doesn't make the official stats.
sounds like a concealed firearm owner acting responsibly and appropriately to save lives.
good riddance!
i think we should supply every american with a harpoon someone's been watching too much ttt i don't recall gandalf wielding a harpoon.
a poon is an istant sign of lewis never thought id see the yogacats referenced in here same.
i know the jinglejam for 2017 is off to a great start, but of all the threads.
a poon-off would be entertaining.
the nfl superpoon 2017 is this your way of saying america is too fat?
not fat, just good at floating or a netgun i want a trident... no, a slingshot with mini hand grenades give every american a gun with one bullet.
i think we should supply every ninja with a blowgun it's nice to see the good guy with a gun get some time on /r/news.
quick reminder to everyone that defensive gun uses like this one happen every day in the us.
some but not all of those stories are covered over at /r/dgu if only chris murphy could see this.
talk about shattering beliefs.
lul is he against guns?
yup.
he thinks its absurd that a good guy with a gun can stop a bad guy with one, so ban them so no criminals can get guns.
10/10 logic since, you know, every bad guy gets his gun legally through all the proper channels.
likely with a comment like that i figured.
i should have been more specific.
i meant is he against concealed carry / 2nd amendment rights / that sort of thing.
yes.
extremely.
i’ll edit with links about all of his gun control measures.
edit: here is one [example](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/07/chris-murphy-senator-gun-control-las-vegas-sandy-hook) that gives an overarching view on what he’s done to try and pass gun control measures.
here is a [hartford courant article](https://www.google.com/amp/www.courant.com/politics/hc-pol-murphy-guns-fact-check-20171017-story,amp.html) about how misguided he is about firearms, specifically “assault weapons” basically, him and dick blumenthal suck, but people listen to them anyways because they have the emotional support of the people after sandy hook.
to paraphrase homer simpson: "to guns!
the cause of, and solution to, all of life's problems" guns are the real life pandora's box.
unless the aliens come and poof away every gun ever created while simultaneously disappearing all documentation and knowledge on how to make them, they are a necessity.
man, i can't wait for hbo's gunpowder.
just realizing how much a fuckin gun changed the world is pretty damn fascinating.
what's that?
show about the history of guns?
that sounds interesting as hell.
it's a new show coming out on hbo.
it looks like game of thrones 2, except without all the fantasy.
takes place in 1603, about an englishmen on a quest for gunpowder to overthrow a king.
'what's a mob to a king, what's a king to a **gun.
**' i like to think that he pulled out his gun and shot him faster than the robber could react, i like to imagine him wearing a hat too, the whole clint eastwood outfit.
and he was smoking a cig while eating.
also the good the bad and the ugly soundtrack playing in the background, and he didnt flinch when he shot him, then he sat down and continued eating.
“do you feel lucky?
well, do ya, punk?” and also they weren't in a restaurant or eating, they were staring each other down in the middle of the street.
the fact that you turned the entire thing into a juvenile power fantasy sums up why america is in it's current state.
i thought this sort of thing has been proven never to happen!
no one says this it is more like people say it is extremely rare and you are more likely to shoot yourself.
but that relies on cherry picking.
you're being downvoted, but correct.
u/u5efull gave a [straw man argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/straw_man).
the actual argument is about costs and benefits.
do the benefits, like events where a good guy shoots a bad guy (e.g.
this thread's article), outweigh the costs, like events were a bad guy shoots a good guy (e.g.
[las vegas shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_las_vegas_shooting)).
if that really is what the argument is about (and i don't feel that's the case), the answer by the numbers is definitely yes.
[even by the most pessimistic estimates](http://www.vpc.org/studies/justifiable17.pdf) (note the very anti-gun tone of the text in general), defensive gun uses outnumber gun homicides 9:1. while most defensive gun uses don't involve the gun being fired or the bad guy being killed (so we're not comparing "bad deaths" to "good deaths" or anything like that), i'm satisfied with the potential number of lives saved per year.
what?
of course they happen, we've known they do.
there are just under 250 justified homicides a year.
but there are hundreds of thousands of dgus every year.
i imagine this was a waffle house, and everyone nonchalantly sat back down and finished their breakfast while the robber bled out.
....thats because of waffles, theres an unspoken bond between man and waffle.
i just refreshed this page to see how the upvote count changes.
it goes up a few then down a few, then up a few and down.
i think people are downvoting because they can't stand to see a self defense gun story where the good guy with the gun saves the day.
not good for the narrative.
interesting that the other stories on the "new" page the same amount of time have five, 21, and thirty upvotes, much less than this.
i don't know how reddit's upvote algorithm works, but maybe this one will go to the controversial section since obviously some people keep downvoting it.
but yes, that is interesting, i agree.
a couple of weeks ago, i noticed a story about a woman shooting an intruder was near the top of the "hot" news for over 24 hours, it was really nothing more than a local story.
i've seen several gun defense stories getting what seems like way more upvotes than any other report that would be considered just a "local interest" story.
that's not what's happening, or more accurately, that is not evidence that it is happening, reddit does that to everything that is voted on.
edit: reddit meaning the site itself not the users of the site as a whole.
it is like a gunfight with votes.
bam bam!
bam!
click!
damnit, i'm out of upvotes!
i need a spare mag asafp!
don't get between and man and is nom noms.
im gonna come back here in an hour or 2 to see what has transpired fascinating, keep us updated.
my bet is on it disappearing like the reciprocity thread.
threadlock, most likely.
not yet so the father just murdered a man with his *gun*?
that's all i read, why did he have to shoot him?
the father needs to be held for murder.
prayers for the victim, the could have just told him to stop and leave.
/s downvote cannons were locked on and armed, but stood down from red alert upon receiving condition "/s" many of my sarcastic people remain in oblivion for forgetting to wear their '/s' modifiers.
why didn't he just shoot him in the leg?
/s clearly, the father needed to dialouge with this individual to better understand his grievances obligatory /s i just hope the guy isn't suffering about killing a man or his family just witnessing it "starnes says the father isn’t facing charges" this seems to go without saying, doesn't it?
he had the gun legally, along with a carry permit.
if this isn't a textbook example of self-defense, i have no idea what would be.
this guy needs a metal stat!
good.
more criminals need to be stopped this way.
this was a really dumb move by the father and he is extremely lucky.
i am a gun owner, so not anti-gun.
if someone is trying to rob you at gun point, just give them the money even if you have a gun.
this situation could have been way worse.
the problem is, as i noted earlier, that you can give up the money and get a bullet in return.
its possible but unlikely in such a circumstance, you would just be driving up the charges against you and the pressure to find and catch you.
its not like you rob a restaurant expecting to kill all witnesses.
thats why the advice is usually, give the asshole what he wants and live to see another day.
like the first thing they taught me in my self defense class was don't try to fight your way out of such situations unless its a really last resort.
they will remind you of that every time they teach you something like kicking things out of a hand or something.
i'd much rather hand over my money than risk a shoot-out around my family.
&gt;i'd much rather hand over my money than risk a shoot-out around my family.
you're assuming the assailant (who is unstable and illogical enough to threaten violence with a gun over pocket change) will think and reason like you.
there's no reason why you complying will result in them leaving you unharmed.
google the brown's chicken massarcre... everyone complied, everyone was executed.
if someone threaten's my life or the life of my loved one, i will take the first available opportunity to stop the threat.
violent criminals committing armed robbery are not compassionate.
*hands over money to avoid confrontation* *gets shot anyway* can i ask what your home address is and what times you, your significant other (if you have any), and any children or roommates work or have class?
for research of course.
what happens when the guy wants to rape your wife or your kids?
you just hand them over too?
it's not like you have a choice.
life is full of ifs.
you know what's weird?
my fb feed has been constantly populated with (admittedly pro) posts about the issue for the last few months, but now it's actually a thing, nothing.
not a word.
i think how it was organised was all just a bit weird, isn't it?
the celebration was when the vote came out, this like the nirty gritty paperwork to make it official.
this part should be irrelevant.
with so much hullabaloo about whether it was legally binding etc, you'd think there'd be celebration for the rubber stamp too.
technically it's not legal quite yet, it has to get signed off by the gg.
i think for a lot of people (in particular those who are gay/bi) they're kind of still at a stage where it hasn't quite sunk in yet.
given the result of the survey blocking the bill would have been political suicide.
as much as you can argue it wasn't legally required there's no way in hell the government could let it be an issue at the next election if they wanted to be re-elected.
the gg certifying it is good as done.
they don't interfere in this, and if he did we would soon be a republic too.
its a ceremonial formality that's part of the legal system.
even in the uk, laws are not technically laws until the queen signs off on them - royal assent.
i think pretty much everywhere in the world, once a parliament/congress/legislative body approves a bill, it gets sent to someone else, generally the head of state, for a formal signing into law.
dude the gg literally staged a coup against the government in 1975 and they couldn't even pass the republic referendum after that debacle.
the demographics are a lot different now there are probably a whole heap of reluctant guys who have just run out of excuses for not marrying their other half.
and then there needs to be the 28 day intention to marry period.
so the 9th of january for about a week then most people will stop caring and it will not news anymore my facebook feed has been filled with celebrations all night wouldn't it be hilarious if the queen said "loli'm gonna totally fuck with those bogans down under" and withheld royal assent.
wait till january 9th.
that’s when the weddings start (two workmates left early to go register) wasn't the not-referendum a few weeks ago?
i guess it makes sense to preach more about an issue when you can potentially influence the outcome.
that's what happened here in the us, too.
before legalization = bedlam, chaos, riots!
people marrying animals and inanimate objects and hellfire and damnation!
someone please think of the children!
the next day... crickets.
all fucks ceased to be given.
it's all over american facebook feeds that's why.
we're hogging it all.
the general public aren't educated in how the "vote" actually worked.
it was literally a survey, however they thought it was the final say.
in this case, on this scale, i'd call it more of a "statement of public will".
there's no way the government *wouldn't* comply with it.
they can't get away with as much in australia without getting kicked out at the next election as they can in america.
now you can all get divorced just like me :d love wins!
except when it doesn’t!
my ex-wives didn't seem to mind.
wait... who has to pay child support if there is no ex-husband?
i pay child support to my second wife.
the first wife was really married to her vidya, she took half me steam list in the end :( what a shitty person, you can take my money, my house, my food, but never ever, my steam account.
i feel you man cheers mate :) child support probation officer here: i know you're joking, but mothers actually pay child support all the time.
it's an outdated stereotype about family court that we never side with the father.
if you file the appropriate motions, show up to court, and bring the required documentation, it's an even playing field.
a guidelines calculation is made based on income.
this calculation affects all aspects of the case, from custody and visitation to child support and medical coverage.
the guidelines do not give a shit if you're male or female--they're raw data.
tl;dr: the person most likely to provide a stable and safe home environment becomes cp (custodial party aka obligee aka parent of primary residence), while the other parent becomes ncp (non-custodial party aka obligor aka parent of alternate residence.)
most importantly, the person who takes personal responsibility and shows up to court prepared usually wins.
i was joking.
sadly however, having been an advocate in custody disputes my experience is inconsistent with yours.
far too often 'stable' is given precedence over 'safe'.
too often have i seen a negligent mother retain custody because the father is a soldier who despite having support arrangements in place might need to deploy at short notice.
in these cases, the disciplined loving father is assessed by the family court as a cash cow, whilst the mother lives fat and happy off the support payments - all the while seeking a new target to fall pregnant to.
who gets the house when gay guys divorce?
the bottom?
i spose it's up to the courts to decide really.
same-sex it up same-sex couples of australia, you've earned this day.
fuck it.
i'm straight and i might go marry a dude just to rub it in tony abbott's big dumb face.
how could you care about marriage when a man is getting eaten by a croc in north queensland?
it was a male croc so it was a same sex mauling and that is legal now.
just reminds me of smith streets "wipe that shit eating grin off your punchable face" don't knock it until you tried it can i interest you in an alimony payment when we divorce?
i mean tony abbott will surely see who’s boss /s how do you earn something like that, that is ridicolous my interpretation of what you said, was that you meant: it’s absolutely ridiculous that gay couples couldn’t get married earlier, and, that they should not have even had to earn/ fight for that right.
i'll bet benefits will extend to same sex spouses bc it just makes fucking sense, mate.
can't wait to watch australian gay divorce court.
divorce court shows gon b gud yup, prospect for divorce lawyers are rising further.
👊 and florists, and bakers, and candlestick makers and tailors and caterers and jewelers and wedding band players.
except, [according to america](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/05/gay-wedding-cake-supreme-court-280944), for the homophobic ones.
on one hand, i want everyone to have equal access to all goods and services regardless of sexual orientation.
on the other hand, i don't want the people who *would* deny service to gay individuals to get any business.
maybe we can force them to make the cakes, and then boycott them *anyway*?
yeah that was going on even before the federal legalization though, down at the state levels.
will there be any follow-up with muslim bakeries too (to bake wedding cakes for gays)?
this case also presents a precedence for people who might ask muslims to bake a bacon cake too.
human rights aren't things that should be approved by legislative or executive bodies because that means we concede such powers to our congress/parliaments.
as such, they can just as easily take them away when a society goes through a fascist phase, as all do at some point.
human rights are not up to any mortal entity to pass judgement on.
human rights and inalienable rights are a concept, not an actual thing.
as society evolves and morality evolves, different societies will change their views on what constitute human rights.
they do not become an actual thing until legislation is passed, and even then they are only a thing within that jurisdiction.
this is an unpopular view, but is the reality.
human rights were given to us by god!
i’m still nervous trump is going to do that.
he said he wouldn’t but he says lots of stuff that he ends up changing his mind on.
he’s pretty bent on rolling back everything obama did just because obama did it.
the president can't undo a supreme court ruling.
but then again, anyone can do anything if the people who hold guns for a living are willing to follow any order.
&gt; the president can't undo a supreme court ruling not alone but the goal of the gop, as outlined on page 11 of their official party platform, is to appoint conservative supreme court justices to help overturn the marriage equality ruling.
they already blocked obamas nomination and appointed their own, now trump is going to likely get a few more picks during his term.
once this happens their goal is to bring a case that can challenge it to the supreme court in hopes to overturn the ruling.
there's already one such case there right now.
you also have places like texas who decided on a whim that marriage equality doesn't mean marriage equality and that gay couples can still be denied benefits (which is currently happening in houston).
and trump actually did promise 4 times that i know of to attempt to overturn marriage equality.
first was on a (now removed) page on his personal site under the title "issues of importance to catholics" where he outlined the gop plan, then again in three more interviews.
religious people absolutely hate gay people, and they have lots of money and pay out to groups who constantly work against our rights.
who gets to determine what is a human right and what isn't?
op of course.
so what happens when you set up a brand new government?
do these rights just happen?
we don't have a bill of rights down under.
parliament giveth and parliament taketh away our human rights at its leisure.
(except for freedom of religion at a federal level, but state parliaments could take that away if they wanted to.)
parliament can't taketh shit from an armed and angry population that's ready to storm the bastille.
good thing the australian citizens are so disarmed good people should have their right to marry who they want to marry and idk why a government has a say in it in the first place while i applaud australia, i can't wait until the label "same-sex" isn't used anymore.
as a typical lazy straight guy, it's just extra words.
seems unnecessary.
how would you name the article?
australian parliament approves marriage equality all adults who love each other finally allowed to marry.
besides, how is that less wording?
the other person didn't want less wording.
they wanted the words same sex to go away.
what about already married adults?
that's why i said all.
some could before, now all of them can.
in a land where everyone is equally allowed to be terrorized by the wildlife, everyone should be equally allowed to live their lives as they please.
dilly dilly, you delightful aussies :) why does bbc never load on my phone?
meanwhile in america: "the president is fine with 'no-gays allowed' signs" -the whitehouse press secretary i find it interesting that the usa is the only ones that get shit on for gay rights.
it's 2017 and australia just legalized it, yet i've never heard a word about this.
i assumed it had been legal... trust me, if you were **in** australia, you'd have heard it.
here in melbourne some guy took his plane up to the sky and wrote "vote no" in the sky.
didn't you hear?
the usa is the center of the universe.
becoz you never been to other countries i beez on de interwebz doe it took a legal loophole to allow same sex marriage in the states because its society is so backward thinking it would have never been legalized in congress (which is the real representative of the people) but it's legal, what excuse does australia have?
you missed the point, australian society is actually more forward thinking than the statian, a same sex marriage law would've never passed the popular vote or the lawmakers vote about fucking time, looks like they worked out what country they work for!
useless pack of fuck knuckles.
[removed] you can feel gross all you like, it's not an argument against same-sex marriage.
you've been brought up in an environment where homosexuality is seen by many around you as in anyway wrong and have inherited some subconscious prejudice.
it's pretty normal and hard to help, but don't expect a pat on the back for it and maybe try and work on getting more comfortable around homosexuals i grew up with a gay best friend who is equally grossed out when i kiss a girl, care to explain again?
i'm as comfortable around a gay dude as i am a straight dude, that has absolutely nothing to do with what grosses me out you obviously aren't.
you compared same sex couples to wiping your ass.
you were against gay marriage in past (and possibly still)?
&gt; i'm as comfortable around a gay dude as i am a straight dude, that has absolutely nothing to do with what you find it difficult to be around gay people when they show affection which by definition makes you less comfortable around them than around heterosexuals.
either way, acknowledge that it is irrational and try not to share it with someone who may be hurt or offended.
i was against gay marriage in the past?
and uh try not to be hurt or offended makes no sense, you can't tell a person they aren't allowed to say something offensive while also not being allowed to be offended, if something offends me and i don't have the right to be offensive right back then the one offending me is being given rights and privilege that i don't have, while everyone tells me i have all the privilege in the world &gt;i was against gay marriage in the past?
yeah, it's in your post history.
&gt;you can't tell a person they aren't allowed to say something offensive while also not being allowed to be offended there is nothing rational about being offended by two men kissing.
&gt;something offends me and i don't have the right to be offensive right back then the one offending me is being given rights and privilege that i don't have yes, because their offense is rational and yours is not.
if i find your face offensive i have no right to tell you to wear a bag over your head, and if you tell me to get stuffed for airing that opinion you are right and i am wrong.
like i went and saw a live wwe event a week ago with a gay dude, wwe is already hella gay so certainly not contributed to my environment as one of those men you think are gross and disgusting, let me just say that its absolutely 100% ok for you to get weirded out or grossed out when you see me kiss another guy.
never apologize for how you feel, just be you.
if you think 2 people in love is disgusting then by all means, be disgusted.
but in the wise words of butters stotch, ask yourself: "what is it about **their** actions that makes **me** uncomfortable?"
what is the connection there?
why do you feel connected to that?
really explore that *why.
* are you automatically imagining them naked in bed together having sex?
are you afraid that you like it a little?
are you subconsciously afraid you might be gay?
because that's exactly what it looks like.
admittedly, i find it a little gross too.
no offense or anything.
and i'm all for gay rights.
but i can always just look away, and we shouldn't let stuff like feeling "gross" affect policy.
the thought of my parents having sex is absolutely disgusting to me... so then why isn't it gross when i see them kiss or hold hands?
two reasons: 1) i'm a mature adult.
2) i don't instantaneously sexualize everything i see.
if people are having trouble discerning the difference between "affection" and "sex" then there are other underlying issues at play.
that being said, its still possible for people to display their affection in public in distasteful ways, regardless of their preferences.
i've seen heterosexual teenagers kissing that made me feel gross.
it wasn't because of their gender, it was because of their tasteless pda.
gay people have to see depictions of heterosexuality everywhere else and besides saying that you feel gross just seeing it is extremely ridiculous and bigoted so ya you are kind of an asshole.
i don't wanna see heterosexuals or any other sexual anything, don't wanna see a straight couple making out either though i thought i addressed that no you did not “address” that at all because your post explicitly says “two dudes” it does not say “displays of affection by anyone” trying to retcon your post to sound less like a bigot?
thats extremely dramatic and unique to you then buddy.
most people on the planet can tolerate other people showing effection to each other in public who the fuck cares.
its not like they are having sex right in front of you.
oh sorry did the though of that make you feel gross?
honestly you can be grossed out about it but im just saying why do you feel the need to share that?
no one said you had to approve of it just live and let live.
you dont like it dont look.
so you never want to see or think about anything sexual, ever?
you might be on the wrong planet for that kind of life chief.
feel grossed out as much as you like, just keep it to yourself.
so... someone doesn't keep themself, i don't enjoy it and therefore i have to keep to myself?
seems like the opposite of "do whatever you like as long as it doesn't affect the happiness of others", it is certainly more appropriate to ask people not to make out in public than to ask the entire public to turn a blind eye ok fine.
i don't like football, so from now on that's banned.
um.
try "banned from being played in public" instead of reaching so far, banning football from being played in public aside of football-specific events wouldn't be strange, if you play football at walmart you're a moron and if you're making out with your significant other in walmart you're a moron yeah, but i hate football chants, football kits, and football supporters.
and since we're all about what *i* want to see, that's all banned from now on.
football will no longer be televised, not played on an open field where someone might per chance see it being played.
&gt;it is certainly more appropriate to ask people not to make out in public than to ask the entire public to turn a blind eye you said kiss earlier.
it is absolutely not appropriate to ask people not to kiss in public, people kiss in public all the time.
so it is appropriate for a couple to sit there in each other's faces while my family tries to eat a meal?
that makes me the inappropriate one for asking them not to?
i certainly can't see how, the progressive era is a cancerous one &gt;so it is appropriate for a couple to sit there in each other's faces while my family tries to eat a meal?
you are shifting the goalposts now.
your original post referred to kissing of any type.
if someone is being inappropriately affectionate you can reasonably ask them to stop, but this has nothing to do with their sexual orientation.
the trolling works better if you can keep it somewhat consistent, and save the “so much for the tolerant left” screed for a better moment, but otherwise, decent effort.
holy shit dude you're so much looking for fights in all answers.
the moment you compared two people kissing to you wiping yourselves you lost everyone.
the fact that you find it disgusting is a product of society.
you wouldnt bat an eye if society told you at young age it was normal.
you might thinkg im wrong, but there is literally no dofference between a guy and a girl kisses.
are you that disgusted by girl kissing ?
i can admit that 2 guy kissing still weird me out a bit but its just because its still a bit unusual to me and i just go over it cause im a grown adult and they are too.
no it isn't, it's called mind your damn business like an adult.
public space isn't yours to police.
you're just digging yourself deeper into a hole at this point.
it is illegal for a man and a women to kiss in public in india and muslim countries.
is that the direction you want australia to go in.
yep, youre an unlovable asshole.
90% of your posts are scolding people for same sex marriage.
90% of my posts are from today so yeah that would make sense, except i'm for same sex marriage so you are clearly quite confused you got to lighten up dude.
if you ever go to europe you'll just drown in grossness.
there men kiss in greeting.
oh come on, that's a light peck not a full on make out those two dudes probably feel the same way seeing a man and woman kiss.
you can feel however you want to feel.
don’t like it, don’t get gay married.
leave others to do as they please.
i dont get this.
so much music and tv shows and movies these days have depictions of couples being extremely sexual towards each other or straight up having sex and it is almost always heterosexual depictions.
which is completely fine but you never hear gay people bitching and moaning about having to see that because it would be fucking retarded.
i think its sweet when i see two people who love each other showing effection, whatever sexuality they are.
not that everyone has to feel that way but it is really dramatic to me to genuinely be grossed out just by a simple kiss on the lips.
not being gay doesn't mean you find men disgusting you just arent sexually attracted to them.
thats just my opinion though, since he did ask for it.
you need to ask yourself why you are grossed out.
the standard viewpoint is that you shouldn't care whether two men are kissing or not.
i see two men kissing and i feel nothing.
maybe i'll crack a smile if i can see they are clearly in love.
even seeing a dick in porn or whatever doesn't phase me.
i'm just like, "yup, that's a dick" and go about my day.
it is arguably conditioning or culture you have experienced that has led you to this repulsed reaction, because in many societies throughout history homosexuality was accepted, not to mention it occurs naturally in nature in most mammals (perhaps most species?).
are you religious, or were you raised in as religious/conservative family?
the freedom that allows same sex couples to marry is the same freedom that allows him to be grossed out by it.
yes, but being grossed out by it is confusing enough for him that he's coming here asking what's up with that.
that's a sign that you're not entirely sure why you are the way you are.
being grossed out by things you don't understand takes far more mental energy than simply not giving a shit.
[deleted] but he's literally just asked us all for our opinion.
and for what is worth, everyone should question themselves every day, on everything.
that's how you grow.
[deleted] are you seriously asking why questioning the things you believe and your attitudes has value?
[deleted] i think you read too much into what i was saying there.
[deleted] yeah i just meant that if he was confused enough that he needed to come here and ask for opinions on his being grossed out then he might want to ask himself why that is.
i wasn't suggesting that he absolutely must change his viewpoint lol.
i could have worded my original comment better.
i'm gay.
you can feel grossed out.
you probably can't help it.
cheese totally grosses me out.
everyone loves cheese, but i gag every time i smell it.
the key is, i don't restrict other people from having cheese.
i just sort of look away recognizing it's their right to enjoy cheese even if i don't.
so, you can be grossed out.
just don't try and stop people from pursuing their kiss because you get a little queezy, and we're cool.
well if you’re a guy the act of kissing another guy is likely to gross you out so no people are already downvoting haha like they're offended that they offended me which somehow makes me the bad guy... such hypocritical times we live in says the person retconning their entire post to try and pretend they’re not a bigot is whining about being downvotes and accuses others of being hypocrites?
pot kettle black your being downvoted because thinking it's gross is not a legal argument against same sex marriage.
where did he argue against same sex marriage, i must have missed that part.
you are making things up.
does it gross you out when you see two women kiss?
i was weirded out the first time i saw it too and i'm gay.
it's just not something most people are used to seeing so there's a shock factor to it.
many gay guys will tell you the same.
as long as you're not combative if you see someone kiss or want to deny us rights you're fine in my book.
[removed] right?
isn't love disgusting?
it must be nice to live in a democracy where these questions are settled by the legislature and hence the voters.
unlike in the us where these questions get settled by judges.
edit: to be clear - i have supported same sex marriage since 1996 when the issue first came on my radar.
i arrived at that position because i believe the government should have as small an impact as possible on our lives.
i just feel that these questions should be handled thru the legislative process.
things passed thru the legislative process have more legitimacy in the eyes of the public and therefor create a more stable society.
it wasn't really settled by voters.
this was the result of the government keeping a promise to pass the bill if a survey showed it was what australians wanted.
technically yes it was "voted" on.
i am more impressed by the fact that this happened under what is a historically conservative liberal government.
labor is secretly fuming that they just lost their prime electoral policy.
probably the main reason why they did it so that labor has less fuel for the fire you can only get so far with medicare scare tactics to be fair, turnbull openly supported ssm before shorten did.
he just had much stronger factional and coalition party opposition to placate.
given the number of labor held electorates with a significant percentage of no voters, i'm far more interested to see potential swings there.
i am legitimately concerned we may very well be on the verge of seeing ethnicly aligned minor parties hold seats in western sydney.
because judges are smart enough to realize that the rights of the minority shouldn't be allowed to be determined by the majority who *already has those rights*.
what the supreme court did was strike down unconstitutional state laws.
those state laws violated the 14th amendment and human rights.
yea!
why should judges ***enforce the constitution*** you guyz!?!?
maybe if us didnt vote shitty people who put shitty judge into power ?
its the same.
judges or whoever can provide the biggest ~~bribe~~ donation [removed] i can't wait to force everyone to make cakes for me.
i'm gonna demand they have a big ol' hammer and sickle as the whole cake so the whole gay family can have slices of communism as they celebrate how fucking gay we are.
or they'll just awkwardly eat our gay communist cake and not ask too many questions.
im not actually convinced the protection amendments are necessary - even for bakers and florists.
antidiscrimination legislation requires you to demonstrate the reason for refusal of service was on account of membership of a protected class.
a baker need only ensure that it isn't the sexuality of the customer he objects to, but the activity he is asked to support.
sexuality is not actually part of the legal definition and any argument to the contrary fails on account of no legal requirement to consummate the marriage.
two straight men can get married just as easily as two gay men.
providing the baker would deny service to both couples, you can't say either have been discriminated against on account of their sexuality.
you’re a joke.
can you imagine the horror those poor florists experience when they put those flowers in a jar?
can you imagine the horror that a baker experiences when they put that cake in the oven?
and someone has to *::gag::* take pictures *::dry heave::* of people in love?
so disgusting.
if i was a photographer and you asked to be my client i would refuse because photographing ugly and obese people is unholy and against my religion.
stop shoving your ugliness down our throats!
i don't know what business you are in, but what if you were forced, under the threat of litigation and fines, to perform your service in support of nazis or the kkk?
do you think you should have the right to morally object and say, "i don't support this, and i'm not going to give my time, efforts and talents to do this thing for them."
there's a name for the act of forcing or coercing people to do work for you whether they like it or not.
it's called slavery.
ok i'll entertain your ridiculous analogy.
i design elevators.
if for some absurd reason the us government suddenly forced me to design an elevator for the nazis i would **find a new job.
** nobody is forcing me to be an engineer.
next question?
but on a side note, if you actually seriously legitimately believe that baking a cake for 2 gay dudes is the same thing as supporting the nazis or the kkk then you're too stupid to be having this conversation at all.
plz legalise asexual marriage isn’t that already legal?
not for coral or jellyfish it isnt okay?
what’s your point?
plenty of asexuals are married - the physical act of sex and sexual attraction is a less important part of the coupling than in other people's marriage.
what part isn't legal already.
[removed] what's the difference?
you think 2 men or 2 women can't raise a child in the same way that one of each can?
[deleted] so when a woman’s husband dies, the child should be removed from her and given to a couple?
makes sense, too bad you aren’t in charge.
every scientific study has shown that children raised by stable same-sex couples have similar (sometimes better) outcomes to children raised by het couples.
better even because parents who can afford to adopt are usually wealthier and can afford more opportunities for their children.
well, given the sheer risk of that child being a criminal or otherwise malevolent actor in society from a single mother household, an unethical, but still foundationed argument can be made.
but what does it have to do with it?
one thing is to die another is to have 2 fathers or 2 mothers.i'm no against samesex marriage, but but what does the child have to do with it?do you know how many discriminations will the kid receive?
that’s ridiculous.
it’s like saying people of one race shouldn’t adopt children of another race because some people might make fun of the kid.
no, yeah, best to avoid that and deny a child two loving parents and a healthy upbringing.
this is my thought.
and you see nothing wrong with that?
that’s crazy.
i guess short people or people with red hair or minorities shouldn’t breed because what if the kid gets harassed for their differences, then, right?
this is the world my friend.
none.
the child won’t receive discrimination because of their parents.
harassment by assholes maybe, but why blame the gay couple for harassment by bigots?
this is my thought.
that battle has been fought and lost in australiaa few years ago.
all the foster agencies specifically target same sex couples where i am at.
so you'd rather an orphan have **no father** than him having two fathers?
wow that's fucked up.
literally the only sentence you ever have to say to destroy the no gay adoption argument.
loving your work.
this is my thought.
imo same sex marriage is not the problem.
trying to force others to validate a lifestyle that they disagree with through legislation is.
no-one forced anyone to become a celebrant.
the celebrant isn't personally validating anything, they're just doing paperwork.
if they don't like doing that paperwork, they should get a different job.
no no, you see, *being forced to tolerate their existence as equals under the laws of society instead of chasing them out of town or killing them like in the good ol' days* is forcing people to validate a lifestyle they disagree with.
lgbt people have been forced to "validate" hetero marriage since, well, forever.
didn't hear you moaning about that.
not gonna lie, i always check air bnb bathrooms and bedrooms because of this.
you should the same in motels and hotels.
happens there too.
i travel a lot for work so i definitely do.
i’ve never found anything in a hotel/airbnb but i have found one in an airline rewards programs shower room.
it was under the bench that looked into the shower.
honestly i thought it was super obvious, and the staff handled it very professionally.
&gt;the staff handled it very professionally.
this can be interpreted in many different ways camera in your shower room?
that's 10,000 free miles for you!
^20,000 ^if ^you ^let ^us ^keep ^the ^footage &gt;^20,000 ^if ^you ^let ^us ^keep ^the ^footage fuck it, you want a trilogy?
hell, if someone were filming me, they may pay me to get dressed.
either way, i win.
ya, you eat that cereal, you filthy filthy whore.
:0 if they were filming me i might get sued for emotional damage they don't need to hide it for free miles.
*cue in porn music* *r. kelly music seems to come from no where* it’s sex not pee man edit: nvm it’s pee &gt; pee man worst superhero ever.

i'll be travelling and using airbnb because it's the cheapest option for the area i'll be in.. there is no foolproof way, it is especially difficult to [locate pinhole cameras](https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/hd-composite-cash-machine-cam-v2new.jpg), but here are some general tips: * one way to detect infrared cameras is to use [your camera on your phone to look for infrared sources](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vssz3imuqye).
turn off all the lights, close the blinds, then turn on camera mode and look around the room.
(note that this doesn't work on every phone camera, iphones for example, only the front facing one works, the main camera has an ir filter), you can maybe use a webcam.
you will be looking for an out of place glowing, possibly purple, most likely just plain white.
(test your camera by pointing a tv remote at it and see if you can see the remote blink) * use a torch (your flashlight on your phone) to shine into vents, drains (especially showers, both in the floor and in the shower itself) and in dark areas, look for reflections, wires or mechanical parts you don't recognize.
* check the corners of the roof, look for anything out of place, bumps or lumps.
* check everything at or below waist level, under sinks, toilets, beds.
* be wary of mirrors in places that you wouldn't expect * cover (sheets/blankets) any devices that you might be concerned with, this includes tv's, dvd players, clocks/clockradios/intercoms, [stuffed toys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzspiojegea), ornaments, lights.
they all could easily hide hidden cameras in their chassis.
keep in mind that some smart tv's now come with cameras.
if you are really paranoid, shower in your swim-wear, [change in a portable tent](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/aeef68af-a6e5-42f4-b5b6-e49c1cd69146_1.17b9bbb90d9e60eabfae25073fc8a645.jpeg).
you know you’re approaching middle age if you’re, like, goddamn, that’s a lot of work for a place i’m staying one or two nights, just watch me pee if it means that much to you.
i lost it at the "change in a portable tent" part.
shit's hilarious.
right?
i'd obviously rather you not.
but i'm not going to search your house making sure you don't get a video of me naked.
here, just have a video of my subpar naked body, you fucking weirdo.
to add one thing to this list.
turn the lights on and off in a room giving yourself about 10-15 seconds between each flip of the switch.
listen for a click after you do it.
most cameras that are used for this sort of thing are both day and night time cameras and you can usually hear a click as it switches from the visible spectrum to the ir.
not always the case but something to look out for.
fire detectors, dvr's and vents shouldn't be clicking just because you turned the light off.
well, you gotta look for a camera, but it can be disguised so also look for any object whose purpose you can't immediately identify.
lol.
then you wont find shit.
there's all kinds of cheap spy cams disguised as all kinds of everyday objects and look nothing like cameras.
a screw in the door could have a camera.
exactly.
spy cams need only a pinhole i heard a hotel magnate earlier this year say that cameras in hotel rooms can be in microwaves.
there was someone in my work place (one of the big 4) who was caught placing hidden cameras in toilets and showers, also in nearby coffee shops.
he had tens of thousands of meticulously categorised and indexed videos.
he was only caught because when they watched the recordings from the camera they spotted in the showers, the first recording on it was him putting it there.
lpt if you're going to do it, have a time delay on it turning on.
lpt don't do it the real lpt is always in the comment...thread.
wouldn’t expect anything less from the big 4 &gt; you should the same in motels and hotels.
but what about holiday inns?
not sure.
my girl started acting up.
screw her, maybe she has a friend you could take?
motel, hotel, holiday innnnn you'll never find them all https://i.imgur.com/pdvlq1e.png terrifyingly discrete.
that's why you have to always cover the smoke detectors :) lpt eta "/s" bc i feel that it's needed bc i actually recall a thread about someone covering it to hide their smoking.
i can see some idiot covering the smoke detector bc they think that someone's filming them.
honestly if someone wants to jack it to me shitting my ass dry, i say let them.
those lovable little scamps.
i always assume someone is watching at all times, and therefore, it's my responsibility to put on a good show for them.
poo diligence and be *professional*.
we owe it to the person who spent that much time/effort setting the camera up to begin with.
dear lord if someone has watched me when my stomach gives me trouble, they are scarred for fucking life.
they're going out of their way to watch people deuce and you think a little diarrhea is going to scar them?
you think i'm talking "a little" diarrhea??
i'm guessing the harder you spew, the harder they get.
“shitting my ass dry” is my new term for pooping.
is there an efficient and reliable way to check for cameras?
it's pretty easy to hide one so that they're impossible to find you have to wait until it's dark (or close the curtains).
turn out all light sources in the room and stand in the corner.
get a flash light or torch, and shine it across the room.
any camera lenses will reflect the light and you'll know to check that area.
also works with spiders in the garden.
but what if it's in the corner you're standing in?
o_o *scratches noggin* what if the spiders are in your room?
how paranoia are you willing to be?
http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/how-to/a7614/build-your-own-electromagnetic-interference-detector-8831727/ this is good but what i'm trying to detect electronic *infetterance*?
ever find anything?
i'm friends with one of the girls.
she was a cheerleader and this was where they all tanned.
http://www.tantoday.com/forums/news-about-tanning/18324-springfield-tanning-salon-owner-charged-videotaping-customers.html the tanning salon thing also happened in a tanning salon in a dirty little english seaside town i used to live in called margate about ten years ago.
the owner/perp went to prison for it.
also a friend's sister was married to a guy who who had a webcam in the bathroom filming his 15 year old stepdaughter.
she found it, told her mother and her mother sent her to live with her grandmother as she was determined "to stick by her husband".
how do you check exactly ?
visual inspection with ya eyeballs ocular patdown then you clear them for passage.
ah, the old mark 1 version 1 eyeball.
in another article they mentioned turning the lights off and use a flashlight, the lens of the camera will reflect the light.
won't find all of them but it's a cheap effective method grab a paper towel roll and a flashlight and hold the roll up to one eye and close the other.
in a darkened room, turn on the flashlight and place it at eye level next to the tube and slowly scan the room for the telltale white reflection.
you can pretend you're a pirate standing on the bow of your cutter if that helps.
arrr.
the best time to do this is mid day on a weekday at your office restroom.
this is when human activity is highest so you are much more likely to catch a camera in its natural habitat.
*this post brought to you by voyeurpiratefetish.com* set off a nuclear device 60,000 feet over the building.
the emp will knock out any cameras.
buy a $10 rf detector that also has a camera reflector.
or spend money for professional shit that can detect even more shit.
or just look with eyes and a light.
&gt; buy a $10 rf detector that also has a camera reflector.
i have one of these and it detected everything everywhere.
either it was faulty or i had multiple international government agencies with high interest in me.
no, there really is that much rf noise leaking everywhere.
if you find a phone or tablet that is filming, take the fucking evidence before you report.
finding a cam in a bathroom or bedroom is police report time; keep the camera and call the non emergency police line and enjoy the fun.
where i live the non-emergency line just transfers you to dispatch aka 911. yeah, i tried to call a non emergency line with a noise complaint because i thought 911 was for emergencies.
the secretary on the other end laughed and told me to call 911. had the opposite experience where my dumbass neighbor kept calling 911 to complain out noise from my family.
police had a policy to respond to all 911 calls so they kept having to come down to tell us that our construction work was fine they just have to show up.
i'm a dispatcher.
next time ask the officers what their department policy is on harassment by police.
at my pd you can be charged for repeatedly calling the police for an issue that isn't illegal.
this happened to my brothers neighbors.
some old lady kept complaining about the noise next door (duplex) and when the police showed up for the 3rd time when my brother was playing on his computer with headphones on, they charged her with something (i'm sure it's just a slap on the wrist) but magically the calls to the police stopped after that.
our term is harassment by police, which sounds a little misleading, but it's using the police to harass someone.
it's most often fake noise complaints or fake welfare check (ex-wife doesn't like dad's new girlfriend so keeps calling in concerned about the kids when she has no reason to be, so officers go check on them and end up bothering then needlessly).
where my gf at the time &amp; i lived, we had a neighbor below us (condo) and she was a nurse and worked various shifts.
so in the mornings (8-11) when shes trying to go to bed.
we were walking around or talking on the balcony, vacuuming, or etc she would call the cops for noise complaints during "sleeping hours".
she called the cops on all 4 units in the building.
she called the cops on the guy starting his corvette that was parked out front at 7am to go to work (told the cop "if he's going to work at 7am, he needs a quieter car!"
) she was off the rails crazy, and she was making noise "going to work" at 9pm-11pm she eventually moved.
and the cops stopped coming for noise complaints after awhile.
this complaint was due to a large construction dumpster right next to our bedroom window that for some reason at 4 am they had to lift several feet off the ground a drop it straight down in order to switch it out with an empty one.
it with the loudest bang i would awake heart racing.
i asked them politely if they could do it some other time, got cussed out.
called the cops, and it never happened again.
my department has a non emergency line, it’s the same people as calling 911 but the phone systems recognizes you as low priority.
also you might be placed on hold if there’s a surge of 911 calls came here to say this.
i called the non-emergency line and was on hold for 30 minutes until they answered "911".
realized i was on hold while they answered the emergencies and i wasn't an emergency so i had to wait.
was ok with that.
i called the non emergency line and told the person i wanted to do a test of my 911 service, and she said go ahead they would put a note down.
so i go to call 911... and get the exact same operator.
turns out it was the same people answering both phone lines and calls just flash up on their screen differently depending on what you dialed.
thats small towns for you i guess.
i once had a friend find a camera in the bathroom of the apartment he and his wife leased.
it ain't just airbnb folks.
this.
i always hated that 'maintenance' could have a key to your apartment.
there's no telling what goes on.
put your own camera in your living room then.
i have a pipernv system setup that sends me a 30s video of it detects any movement when i’m not there and if the doors or window sensors trip i get a text message.
took 5 minutes to install with the 4 door/window sensors.
yeah this is a pretty foolproof system, i'm thinking of getting one.
but $100-$200 investment for one of these at the very least.
&gt; but $100-$200 investment for one of these at the very least.
fuck that's cheap compared to a couple of years ago.
yeah, but $100 is really just the budget level products.
this is what i did.
any time i called maintenance i’d just check up on them at work.
plus, i had motion detection set to email me every time.
got a lot of footage of my cat, but there was always a piece of mind.
i recently moved from a really sketchy apartment complex and i flat out did not trust the management/maintenance, even better the maintenance people were a 3rd party contractor so even if they stole our shit while we lived there, apartment management couldn't be held responsible.
they often sent out notices for "inspections" for this and that reason and every time, i called the front desk asking what time my building would be inspected, as i would be taking an hour off work to be in the unit at that time.
amazingly enough, my apartment was never inspected...... also when i turned in my notice that i wouldn't be renewing my lease, they sent me a notice telling me that management would be doing an unannounced inspection sometime within 10 days before or 10 days after the end of my lease.
i called the front desk raising hell, and they told me that they had no such policy and didn't know what i was talking about, even though i was reading directly off the notice stamped with their management logo.
i know in va they have to give a 24 hr notice before they can enter to inspect.
so this " eh sometime we will come in and look" one time i caught maintenance guys going through my cupboards in the kitchen.
they didn't know i was home.
called my roommate, and she told them she wouldn't be home for a few hours, so they said they'd come in the afternoon.
turns out they were standing at the door when they spoke with her.
"uh, we're here to fix the leak."
"you mean the dripping faucet in the bathroom?"
i caught a maintenance man stealing weed from me once what a fuckin dick as a maintenance man.. we need access in case of an emergency like a flood or fire.
i can't tell you how many times i've entered a unit for a water leak where no one is home.
i know its unnerving but its necessary also we don't want to be there.
its too easy for some prick to accuse me of stealing a 20 that was never even there to begin with.
thanks for your perspective on this - it helps.
and it was a $100 and my priceless artwork.
and my axe!
&gt; also we don't want to be there.
that's the problem.
you can't talk for everyone.
there are always fucking weirdos in all professions, i'm certain all maintenance staff aren't exclusively 100% good persons neither.
why don't you buy a gopro and records your way in and out, no cuts?
nobody would accuse you of something, specially if the house has alarm and you need to disable it, and it has a log about when it was turned off.
edit: stupid idea?
how the fuck are you going back inside without turning off the alarm again and having it logged, just to steal?
if someone wants to steal so bad, they'll break in later, not during work.
then somebody could just say they stole something on a trip without the gopro on.
not that hard to record one "clean trip" then go back without the camera rolling and snatch something.
because you shouldn’t have to invest $300 for a stupid camera as a maintenance guy where i live they have to inform you 24h in advance if its not an emergency.
twice i entered my apartment and noticed they came to do stuffs without my knowledge.
then my sink pipe broke and it took 1 month to be fixed.
hated them.
i was wondering if there's something i could buy to detect recording devices.
i found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9kmzex3cpa).
illuminating.
(i can't attest to whatever he's selling though.)
e: apparently, there's this contraption called a cc308+ that can do the job for cheap.
here's [one video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vygva_ywx2w).
e2: more expensive (and probably more reliable) [options](https://www.uspystore.com/counter-surveillance/hidden-camera-detectors#).
an old standby is to turn off the lights in a room and use a flashlight; the camera lens will reflect a shine in a place where there shouldn't be a shine.
works but you have to shine the light at the same angle takes forever and a large room for error aren't most camera lenses convex, so there's a way bigger angle at which you'd see glare?
yes, to focus the light.
it should reflect from all angles unless they put a flat piece of glass on front to prevent people from finding it easily.
the same thing works for finding spiders.
during the summer head out to a dark area with a bright flashlight.
shine a flashlight at the ground.
all that sparkling you think is dew is actually spider's eyes retroreflecting the light you are shining.
i didn't believe this the first time i read it.
then i happened to be on a jogging boardwalk after dark with a headlamp.
i look down and see all these drops of dew...then i remembered my newly found fact.
so i got down for a closer inspection of these drops of dew.
sure enough...spiders...spiders everywhere!
thanks for ruining dew!
if they have wifi then you can also use an app like fing to see if there’s any suspicious devices on the network.
assumes they’re dumb enough to use the same network you’re on, anyway.
there's a good chance it's just offline recording to a microsd card, too.
huh.
one time i found a forum of people posting 'airbnb porn' on mega.
thought it was all fake.. now i'm not so sure i've stumbled upon a few of these on 4chan.
they look pretty legit.
plus those weirdos literally follow women in the street and film up their skirts so i believe it.
if the hidden camera has an infrared illuminator to see in the dark, turn off the lights and scant he room with you phone's camera app.
any illuminator will typically appear as blue or purple on your screen because the sensor on the phone can see ir light.
i have a thermal camera that plugs into my phone.
it can also be used to detect abnormal heat sources like recording equipment hidden in otherwise cold objects.
this presumes the cameras are wireless they usually are, wiring your home with cameras is expensive and done for more specific purposes, you have to tear up your walls usually, that's no joke.
only a very, very dedicated perv would do that just for abnb.
wireless cameras are cheap, small, no wiring, easy to hide.
i'd wager 99% of those cams in the article are wireless.
or recording locally.
amazon has [**a bunch**](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=a9_asi_1?rh=i%3aaps%2ck%3ahidden+camera&amp;keywords=hidden+camera&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1512657414) of hidden cameras disguised as things like usb chargers, smoke detectors, alarm clocks, etc.
and they all seem to record to microsd.
i wonder how you can find them.
i mean of course they are.
you’ve got to think that there are tons of people out there that only do airbnb to get footage like this not only that but the renters probably don't trust the people renting and want to keep an eye on them.
funny these cameras were found in the bathroom and bedrooms pointed at the bed.
you can put cameras in normal places for safety and let the renter know.
safety was not the purpose in these cases.
yep, i have been in an airbnb where the owner said there was a camera on the front and back porch, there was, but i also looked around the airbnb to make sure that is all they had one place had a camera linked to the security system iirc.
dude told us how to disable it if we wanted to.
except it's illegal in most states to film someone in a place where they have a reasonable expectation of privacy without their consent.
i agree, i'm not saying its right, i'm just saying i don't think its just guys trying to see naked people.
i think some of these people are under the assumption that its ok if you are trying to protect your stuff.
its not.
this is why my home won't ever be in the program.
it's literally blanketed in camera coverage and it would take too long to document it all.
the article mentioned switzerland so the issue spans more than just the us rentals seeing that airbnb is in almost all places.
tho it probably is also illegal in switzerland yeah i understand that logic, but at the same time that's one of the risks you're signing up for when you're basically getting paid to rent your living space out to strangers to a website that makes it super easy to find clients.
it's no different than being an uber driver and having someone puke all over, or physically damage, your car's interior.
you can't have one foot in and one foot out about this.
you're either fully committed to trusting the system (in return for what could potentially be good pay) or you just don't participate at all.
violating anyone's privacy isn't in the cards here.
there's no reason you can't disclose this.
there's even every opportunity to make sure that the cameras are only recording when it's reasonable to do so.
"i have security cameras all around my house for the protection of my family, myself, and my property.
these cameras will be recording before you arrive.
when you enter your primary access code on any of the entry doors, these cameras will be turned off automatically.
similarly, if you lock the doors, they will be turned back on.
this is as much for me, as it is for you - any damages that occur while you away will thus be recorded and will not be held against you unless they are the result of your negligence (e.g.
a vase falling over after you leave because you balanced it on the edge of a table).
if for any reason you do not wish the cameras to be recording when you leave the house - perhaps you are leaving your teenage kids behind but don't want them recorded - enter your primary code on the lock instead of the regular lock button; this will lock the door and leave the cameras off.
if you appreciate your security as much as i do mine, you may also opt to have the cameras remain recording after entering the home by entering your secondary access code instead.
the cameras can also manually be turned on and off at any time through the guest web portal.
see our welcome guide, available to you in the entrance hallway, for details."
had a group of friends this happened to earlier in the year, about 12 people rented a large house for a celebration (people traveled out of state for this) and they found hidden cameras all over the house needless to say they didn't feel much like celebrating after that and couldn't make a short notice switch for the party since they needed a house around the same size with a large kitchen for food prep.
not sure how they ended up handling it but i would have raised holy hell if it were me.
steal the cameras.
what would the owner do?
report that they had hidden cameras taken out of the tenant bedrooms?
this.
i'd steal the camera every time.
wipe them, place on ebay, enjoy the rental you already paid for.
the person renting it to you has no recourse as they can't report their hidden cameras as stolen to airbnb or police because it would implicate them in a worse crime.
reminds me of this scene on cops https://youtu.be/_jkwzuk3kng (1 minute) what a quirky little ecosystem.
think i'd prefer to file civil and criminal charges vs getting to keep a few cameras.
steal some cameras and do nothing else?
they'll just buy more cameras and do the same thing to their next victims.
during my trip to europe this summer one of my hosts somehow knew that i had switched my train ticket to an earlier time.
i never mentioned it to them because i was going to be out long before checkout time.
then the cleaning lady showed up 3 hrs before my original checkout time, right as i was leaving for my train.
got on the phone with my host and he somehow knew i was on the 1030am train instead of the 2pm train.
as soon as he mentioned it he started backpedaling and told the cleaning lady to leave immediately.
can't prove it but they either had cameras in the place or they were monitoring my internet usage, either way, creepy as hell.
this is why i always fluff my junk a bit before i take it out in air bnbs.
cant be looking small for the cameras anyone recommend a wand or something that you can sweep a room for cameras with?
hitachi wand would do the job 100% best buy we've made this year.
oooh, is it like a fun harry potter thing?
my kids would love that!
bug hunting is a pain in the ass.
you might be able to use some kind of sweeper that is tuned to the frequency of the cmos power converter or something.
whatever is noisiest on the camera chip.
i don't think there's anything publicly available.
i'll continue brazenly making coffee topless in my unscreened bnb room.
because honestly, even if they post the footage online, with billions of hours of hardcore porn videos out there, what are the chances someone i know will click on "topless girl makes shitty hotel coffee" filmed from a fixed, probably out of focus, angle.
"fat dude stumbles around in the dark for 5 minutes" no easy way to sweep for battery powered or plugged devices that record to a memory card.
at least not as a civilian.
it could literally be inside a stereo or even the cable box.
if it's not transmitting wirelessly you aren't going to find it with a wand.
yeah novel covert implants can be really hard to detect.
[like this famous one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_thing_(listening_device)) you can use an ir camera to find the ones that work in the dark.
you can use your phone camera to find those.
turn off the lights, turn on your camera, look for the light source.
if you point a tv remote at your phone camera you can see the ir light when you press the button.
my girlfriend and i found one.
the only way it got found was because she saw the colored reflection on the lense and recognized it from my fpv drones.
it's a little $20 aomway camera from hobbyking.
i'd post pictures, but there's an ongoing investigation right now.
i would immediately lose my shit.
was the person in the same house when it happened?
the couple times i’ve been in an airbnb, the homeowner was also on property for a good amount of my visit.
i would think for those that partake in this voyeur, it’s more of a complete residence rental rather than just a room.
since, you can't post a picture of the camera, [allow me.

creeeeeeeepy people are more numerous than we want to believe.
the place next door to me is an airbnb.
accordingly, i named my wifi network "airbnb_hidden_cam" move over "fbi_surveillence_van".
you've got one that actually approaches believability.
i wouldn't expect the fbi to be that dumb, but i could definitely see some "gotta protect my stuff" airbnber being dumb enough to call their spycam a spycam.
(on a related note, i need to rename my travel router "rm218_spycam".)
it was "wecanhearyoufucking" when i lived in a 20 unit apartment a few years back.
initially it was targeted at a particular neighbor, but i kept it after a new network showed up.
it was named "sorryaboutthenoise."
incidentally, the building got quieter.
check every bathroom that isn't your own.
also check your own bathroom in case you placed any hidden cameras to spy on yourself.
first airbnb i stayed at had one, my friend who stayed along with us was always paranoid about them and i thought he was crazy.
sure enough he found one behind the dvd player facing the couch, and right past that was the master bedroom bed that would be viewable with the doors open.
nice little place on the river in glenwood springs co. if this happens to you don't call airbnb.
call the police and then call a lawyer.
im currently staying in an airbnb right now with my so... i should probably check pornhub amateur section.
i thought that was a typo for “son” at first and was very worried.
i pitty the poor person that gets a video of me in the buff.
it'll look like a grizzly escaped from the zoo.
whats more offensive, that someone puts a camera in your airbnb, or that when you find it you realize they already deleted the video?
creepy.
why are people so horrible?
no idea.
let's check the cameras and find out.
i run an airbnb from the spare room in my apt.
i put a dark activated night light in the bathroom-for.
convenience.
it helps in a dark place you yave never been before.
it has a little glass light sensor that happens to point towards the shower.
i have had multiplw guests unplug it and put it under a towel- i suppose they were being paranoid it was a camara.
also, nothing new.
conventional landlords/maintenance workers/hotel owners have all been guilty of the voyouer.
i am not excusing it, it's just not airbnb specific or something new with airbnb.
to make them feel safe, consider putting a sign near it.
something like this: "totally normal nightlight.
nothing to see here.
no reason to unplug."
if multiple people have been creeped out by your nightlight why do you keep putting it back in?
why not remove or replace it?
this is why i always set off an emp whenever i stay anywhere.
in the soviet bloc, it was routine for hotel rooms used by westerners to be bugged for sound and video.
useful potential blackmail material.
even happened to james bond (although that was in istanbul) you mean constantinople?
man, you know that ain’t your business... yep.
i recently posted this little gem.
&gt; i recently stayed at a airbnb in boston for a family wedding.
the owner of the house had a bottle of louis xiii on display in the dining room.
despite the fact that it was an expensive house, the bottle display just seemed ridiculous.
so i looked around, and noticed the small camera pointed at the bottle hidden in a small display statue.
i wanted to fuck with it, but ended up just pulling the un-sealed top to give it a smell.
it was obviously very cheap cognac.
i thought hennessy vs. i took a whif, then gave the finger to the camera.
&gt; when we gave the keys back, the home owner said he saw me messing with his bottle of louis.
and i told him i knew it wasn’t louis.
and then i was kind of rude to him in response.
he kind of tried to laugh it off, while admitting it was fake and “just a gag.” but i got the feeling that he used it as a ruse to overcharge guests that may have touched it without knowing it wasn’t real.
that really seems like some shady form of baiting, and depending on where it was, there may be laws against it.
did u report him for having a camera?????????
so when you check into your room, the new procedure should be, set the room temperature, unpack your clothes, check room for hidden cameras?
yes, but the first thing to do, before you bring your suitcase into the room, is check for bed bugs.
then your list... there's a ca statute which says it's illegal to film or record without consent where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy i’m pretty certain that’s illegal in all 50 states yeah, but in california, it is also known to cause cancer.
and you have to have your emissions checked.
it is, but the definition of "reasonable expectation of privacy" varies from state to state seriously?
a fuckin iphone just sitting there?
that's next level dumb.
"hehehe, for the next 4 hours i'll get a great show until the battery dies!"
their logo is a ball sack and people are surprised there are people spying on yours?
i like to think of it as an opened up paper clip &gt; in june, a german tourist settled with airbnb for an undisclosed amount after allegedly finding a hidden "remote-controlled camera" at a property in california.
&gt; hilden said while airbnb refunded her for the switzerland stay, and reimbursed her for other travel expenses, she still felt it wasn't enough.
this is so stupid, sue the person who put the cameras up, not airbnb.
this is why we can't have nice things.
to the extent airbnb represents that the listings they have have been vetted and are safe, then they put themselves on the hook for legal liability.
sort of similar to how lyft and uber, despite referring to their drivers as independent contractors, expose themselves to liability by representing that they background check their drivers to ensure safety.
if they both put a big disclaimer on their site that says hey you’re totally doing this shit at your own risk, they’d have a much better position legally.
but then, not nearly as many people would feel comfortable using their services.
shut up and let me watch you pee.
airbnb do hold some responsilbility as it was rented through them as a service.
issue with a lot of these new businesses like this they want the money without any of the responsibly or regulatory commitments.
if someone commits a crime using their service they should be just as accountable.
see also: kickstarter et al.
project gets funded for $100,000.
kickstarter takes their 5% (or whatever it is now) for $5,000.
project ends up being a scam.
kickstarter absolves themselves of all responsibility and will tell you to go sue the person who ran the project.
the fact that they profited off of the scam is, as far as they're concerned, moot.
the only reason those platforms have for trying to keep bad projects, bad home owners, bad drivers off of their service is to make sure that public opinion doesn't sway too hard against them.
they don't want to become known as 'that place that has scammers'.
but if a few slip through - even if that's because they're only trying just hard enough to prevent that public opinion scenario - that's alright; it's just profits to them.
airbnb is also responsible.
they are offering a service and acting as the distributor, they have a responsibility to make sure the service they're offering is legitimate.
the lack of responsibility airbnb has evidenced so far, their incredibly shitty corporate practices, and what airbnb has done to the availability of housing in many cities are all reasons why i will never use their services and will continually fight against them.
i'll be checking the smoke detectors from now on.
how do you fit a phone into one of those?
and the co detector, and the radon detector, for chrissake.
a lot of these are fucking amateurs.
with shit like [these](https://www.amazon.com/corprit-hidden-600tvl-covert-security/dp/b074smm191) most folks wont even know when to look and what to look for.
buying a digital device detector the video mentions might be your best bet.
i have a friend who says this is why they will never stay at an air bnb.
for me, it's still not a good enough reason to go back to staying in hotels.
maybe i have no modesty.
cameras are found in hotels all the time though... yeah where do people think they were putting the cameras before there was airbnb?
yeah, i don't want to say "who cares," but never doing things because you are that paralyzed by fear seems way worse than someone having a pixelated video of my hairy asshole while i hump my wife.
yeah - about that- can you guys flip?
i live in farmington, and was driving to aztec on my way up north for work when this happened.
found out about it from my son's school in farmington going on lockdown.
the amount of people driving at high speed from farmington to aztec, assumably parent's trying to pick up kids... it was quite heartbreaking.
i'm in aztec and have a sister in school here.
thank everything she was in her main school and not the highschool today, same with my brothers girlfriend.
his girlfriends sister is unaccounted for though which is terrifying.
any news on his girlfriend's sister?
not among the dead or wounded, but unaccounted for.
may have ditched today.
well, i guess i couldn't be too angry in that case.
in farmington high, the lockdown started around 8:40 and ended around 11. tension was high.
i go to pv.
the events of today was just so...tense.
piedre vista, a hs in farmington (12 miles away from aztec), for non-locals.
yes, but having friends and members of the community that go to aztec was still one of the most frightening experiences of my life as our schooled was threatened over the past few weeks.
and the rumors of attacks happening at our school was terrifying.
i feel awful for those that had to go through the events at aztec &gt; assumably parent's trying to pick up kids... "i gotta fucking fly down this highway to pick my kid up from a lockdown where they wont allow them out anyways aaargggh if i die or kill other people with my shitty driving so what!!!!"
yeah.
heartbreaking.
i'm in aztec.
i graduated last year so a lot of the people are my friends.
we are a very small town.
everyone kind of knows each other.
can't go anywhere without running into someone you know.
casey jordan and paco fernandez.
i didn't personally know any of them but casey's mom is a close family friend.
we gave her our graduation decorations for casey so she could save some money.
my moms co-workers were all at the police station or wherever when a police man came to her and took her away into a room.
everyone heard her screaming when they told her that her daughter wasnt okay.
the locked down all the schools in the area and bussed all the ahs kids to mcgee park to reunite with parents.
caseys mom didn't get go go to the park to pick up her kid today.
my sister said she knew her.
my sister had to go take a psychology final right after finding out she died at the college.
all my friends are devastated.
they recently confirmed that it was another student who was the shooter.
one of us.
its nice to see everyone come together though.
i've never seen our school united so quickly.
once a tiger, always a tiger.
stay strong people.
we are trying our best.
sorry if my grammar or spelling is off.
i'm talking to so many different people right now.
dont really have time to make sure everything is 100% right.
thanks for the support.
love you all i’m from farmington and my brother is a cop there, this kind of news is like a punch to the gut.
there are always people impacted by these things, it sucks when it hits close to home.
my cousin is a police officer over in bloomfield, he got called to aztec to help out when it happened.
i've never been so worried.
please remember: most info in the first hour is likely off and will be revised.
fox news reported "2 dead" within the first 30 minutes with no citation of sources, meanwhile everyone else was still saying "multiple injured."
that's the kind of reporting that really grinds my gears.
scaring people senseless with no proof at the time of the information.
well it’s looks like they were right so... you still need to say where the info came from if there is no other source posting it though.
this is news coming to terrified parents who worry if their child is dead or alive, giving info like that is reckless without sources.
i don't know why you're being downvoted.
the media is a joke.
exploit human emotions for higher ctr's resulting in higher cpms for their shitty inventory.
journalism is dead.
hey guys, i'm a local.
please keep us in your thoughts and prayers.
3 confirmed dead, 14 wounded.
one shooter dead.
my sister lives in farmington and works in aztec.
she luckily doesn't have any kids but is very worried for her coworkers.
stay strong friend &lt;3 i have family in school here.
my sister bounces between the middle and highschool for classes.
thank the gods she was at the middle school today.
brother's girlfriend was at the college instead, but her sister we can't find any info on.
i hope she is okay.
i'm very glad to hear your immediate family is alright.
pm me if you need to talk.
she's not among the wounded or dead.
she may have ditched today.
oh man i hope so.
thanks for the good news update.
yeah, in this case, no news is good news.
i don't understand why this is sitting at the bottom of /r/news.
we are so used to it unfortunately.
that's sad to just think about.
seriously.
idk if this will make the front page how fucked up is that.
because shootings are normal now.
this is considered acceptable and not a big deal.
anything with less than 10 deaths won't even make the national news.
weird.
it's a top story on google news.
sorry this thread isn't getting enough upvotes to your satisfaction.
clearly no one cares about gun violence because reddit news hasn't moved this story higher up on the list.
would be national coverage for over a week in any other developed country.
i had to search "new mexico" and sort by top/hour to find this thread.
nothing confirmed yet, those are just the numbers floating around.
local schools in preventative lockdown.
college is still open.
police are maintaining visible presence at all local schools.
aztec police are handing investigation to state and fbi.
edit: 3 confirmed.
no other reported injuries (1:01pm).
the police have confirmed the 3 and 14 here locally.
yep, ap confirms.
shooter is also dead.
http://www.koat.com/article/active-shooter-reported-at-aztec-high-school/14380005 yeah source it... cause i work in the media here and we do not have confirmation numbers.
from family on scene and in the school, https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aztec-new-mexico-high-school-shotin_us_5a29652be4b0b185e539e866 and a local media outlet with a more recent update http://www.koat.com/article/active-shooter-reported-at-aztec-high-school/14380005 thank you.
i'm also seeing the ap report.
we're on the phone with state police now confirming.
https://apnews.com/3621148a4443499788a38c2dcbe235ec edit: just confirmed 3 dead, including shooter.
no other reported injuries.
for legal purposes, i am not an official reporter, just passing on what i'm hearing from multiple sources.
also, per the so, students can be picked up from mcgee park at noon.
this actually coming from a deputies mouth.
i wouldn't have sourced shit with that miserable attitude there's nothing wrong with demanding sources.
fear mongering does nothing to help, and repeating hearsay is fear mongering.
he's right, though.
it could be read as terse.
if that was the case, i apologize.
it's been a... brain fog sort of morning.
:/ edit: smiley to slanty.
i don't feel like smiling.
i just did it out of habit.
we're all angry and upset here man.
i'm at the point of beating someone over the head myself.
hard to wholeheartedly smile when tragedy strikes like this.
especially at your own home, it seems.
small towns seem to have the hardest hitting impact when there's so much kinship.
my strongest sympathies to you lot.
they're not telling us who is gone... but one of my friends, who is a teacher there, has reported in, so that's good.
it's gonna be a hard night for all of us, especially so for the families who aren't getting good news.
:( i forgot where i heard/read but i believe the families of the deceased have already been informed.
i don't want to imagine what those families will deal with being informed their child was killed at a place that should always feel safe.
you don't need to apologize.
you have no time in your line of work on a day like this to write overly worded, super nice requests for sources.
http://www.koat.com/article/active-shooter-reported-at-aztec-high-school/14380005 and here's the local news source for you all.
http://www.koat.com/article/active-shooter-reported-at-aztec-high-school/14380005 i don't understand why this is sitting at the bottom of /r/news.
hardly news anymore in the us small town, mostly, i imagine.
a lot of mass shootings are it's up there now.
3 dead.
no injuries.
police had a response time of under a minute.
its a good thing their station is only a couple blocks away are the dead people students?
the victims names are as of yet being withheld, but at least one was a shooter.
love from ca.
it's awful to hear about the deceased, and i hope the wounded recover soon.
sorry if it’s been already updated but they just showed the press conference with the governor and local law enforcement and they said there were no other injuries beyond the two student fatalities.
sending love from albuquerque abq journal is saying no one other than the deceased are injured.
that's nice, both my first responder brother and the local news says otherwise.
posted sources below.
abq journal is local as well just trying to figure out what right, this is directly from their article &gt; reports had circulated earlier that 15 had been injured, but state police said no there were no other injuries.
abq is 200 miles away.
it's kob and dt up here.
koat and krqe are all saying state pd said no other injuries.
kob even says it isn't confirmed, &gt;15 others are injured, according to a statement by the navajo nation office of the president and vice president.
however, state police officials have not confirmed that.
not trying to argue just hoping less people are hurt me too, man.
me too.
but both my mom and brother were there, and both saw/dealt with wounded.
as shitty as it is, hoping it was the fatalities being taken out.
but... that's not what my brother was saying.
my mom works a block away and watched them medivac wounded herself, as well.
here's the daily times (local newspaper) story: http://www.daily-times.com/story/news/local/aztec/2017/12/07/school-shooting-aztec-high-school/930793001/ why do more and more kids these days feel the need to grab a gun and kill a bunch of their classmates?
why don't they just point the gun at themselves instead of taking out innocent people with it?
that's the million dollar question that everyone has been asking for decades since mass killings started at schools in america.
probably the stigma that comes with getting help for mental illnesses and all of the bullying that follows so kids bottle it up and never seek help and explode.
not to mention access to quality mental healthcare is terrible - over half the psychiatrists in the country don’t even take insurance.
there’s not enough beds in hospitals.
that’s not even getting to patient compliance and recovery.
costs are a huge barrier, even for me.
with insurance, a monthly appointment will cost $45, plus meds (luckily generic) at $10.
if i added weekly therapy, which i should, that’s an additional $40/week.
now imagine someone not in a stable place, not having a steady income trying to manage that.. they want the satisfaction of killing those that hurt them before they go out.
a lot of it has to do with mental illness as well.
i don't think there's anything that would drive a sane person to shoot innocent people.
it probably has to do with bullying.
schools often don't take bullying seriously enough and parents believe that sending letters to the school is either enough to help or they tell their kids it is a normal part of life.
how do underage kids keep getting their hands on guns despite the epidemic of school shootings?
that's the real question if you ask me.
either people aren't taking proper care of their firearms or more and more criminal dealers are approaching youths.
they're trying to express contempt for existence, and the darkest way to do that is to shoot someone whose extremely innocent, in a way that will get them the most coverage.
an alternate theory is they blame the population at large for their issue.
they have a specific target who's driven them to this point, and blame the rest for ignoring/enabling the abuse.
a few reasons (or combination of): - they want to take out those they feel are responsible for their own suffering.
- they know they won't have to face responsibility/justice for their actions.
- they want others to feel their pain and suffering.
- they can't see the value in life as others around them do.
in essence, their perceived existence is the same as any other...meaningless.
the same reason why terrorists attack ice cream stores instead of political targets.
1. because the targets are easy attach a sense of malevolence towards.
if you're in school you feel aggression, envy, etc towards your peers or happy people in general.
2. grouped together, not secured.
there's a whole bunch of people and not many people around to do anything about it.
3. shock factor, 4. imitation factor- these school shooters know they'll get more attention for killing a bunch of kids that opening fire on a cross walk.
it also sets them in a group of their "peers".
they are solving their problems the way they have seen others solve their problems, with violence.
crime, military, police, movies, music, video games, pop culture, books, magazines, news papers, everywhere you look, people are using violence to solve issues.
society as a whole is violent as fuck then we ask ourselves why people do these kinds of things.
we live in a profoundly sick society and few people want to confront the atomization, narcissism, nihilism, and futility people growing up now get steeped in.
the talking heads will talk about drugs, guns, "mental illness", but that's not quite it.
negative culture around mental health + glorification of violence in popular culture and identification of masculinity with violence + easy access to guns this is one of the schools i work with.
i was just there a couple weeks ago.
i thought it was a really nice school and the students were great to work with.
i'm just shocked.
this kinda of thing can really happen anywhere and the worst part is it seems like it's happening more often.
i've become so numb to shooting that this doesn't phase me at all.
it's realkly telling how 'normalize' this all is when it's not major breaking news.
edit: spelling i live in farmington and goes to high school here, although i didn't expirience the shooting i did see the affect that it had on people at my school, it all felt weird, because you don't expect something this tragic to happen near you, one of my friends had a friend in aztec high school that unfortunately passed away today shootings like these are just another daily reminder of our superior culture who did it and why?
we dont know who did it until the investigation wraps up hopefully tomorrow.
all my friends figured out who died.
the whole school kinda just messaged everyone until we knew who it was.
casey and paco.
casey is the daughter of one of my moms friends.
police won't tell us who it is for sure that died but we already figured it out.
still dont know who the shooter was.
at least i dont.
more info will come as the investigation gets more underway and wraps up tomorrow hopefully.
i'm glad all my friends are okay.
once a tiger, always a tiger.
so, are we ready to talk about gun control yet?
edit: too soon, thoughts and prayers, our hearts are with the victims, no one saw this coming, etc.
edit 2: lol, brigaded as fuck.
where did i get linked?
would love to read your comments.
post was only 3 minutes old when this comment was posted.
you need some control i expect to see these same comments when a muslim terrorist attack happens then, right?
well the thoughts and prayers from the last time this happened didn't keep the kids at this hs alive and well today did it?
as sad as this whole thing is.
right.
thoughts and prayers.
a heartfelt tweet.
those are more important.
ya, fuck him for bringing up the biggest issues as they happen.
when is the right time to talk about it?
not during a tragedy, not after... so we just ignore it forever?
i see this as a problem with violence, not a problem with guns.
but go for it, what would you prescribe?
if you can suggest a law that doesn't sound totally fucking stupid (ex: ban all guns!
), a law that doesn't punish 99.9% of law-abiding citizens because of the actions perpetuated by a few, a law that doesn't break the "due process" part of the constitution, then we might come to an agreement.
it's a problem with both.
we have a problem with mental health and a problem with guns.
it doesn't have to be one or the other.. we've got issues across the board.
i agree it doesn't have to be one or the other, i think there's lots of gun control that even the hardest nra members could get behind (and they have).
they don't want bad guys having guns any more than you do.
problem is, we know what most of the gun control you would suggest looks like.
you may not have been here for it, but we've had this conversation many times before you decided to join in.
we've been having it for over 20 years already.
when bad things with gun happens, politicians will scramble over each other to see who can be the first to pass a sexy new law that bans a plastic attachment... and their constituents will love them for it because.... like ralph wiggum, they get to pat themselves on the back and say, "i'm helping!"
i'm giving you the benefit of the doubt here to not just assume you're going to repeat the same 12 tired, talking points.
so i'll ask again, what would you prescribe to fix the gun issue?
ban all mentally ill, confiscate them and lock them away.
why aren't you for that?
because that's a terrible idea?
the mentally ill need health services.. not isolation and punishment.
i agree and the 299,998,000 guns owned by us citizens not ever used in crimes shouldnt be confiscated either "when" is when you come up with some real answers for the issue at hand instead of moaning about "assault weapons" (when rifles have the smallest amount of deaths attributed to them), concealed carry laws (when conceal carry owners are some of the most law abiding people studies), buybacks (which either don't accomplish anything in studies or are just your way of saying mandatory confiscation) or anything else that isn't exactly mental health (for suicides which make up most deaths) and urban poverty (that is connected to most homicides).
when your side does that, without an ulterior motive, there will be progress.
oh please.
he's not a politician or a law maker.
it's not his job to come up with the ideas.
it's his job as a citizen to express his concern on the issue to his representatives, who in turn, do fucking nothing about it.
go for it.
what “common sense” gun control would you like to talk about.
edit: still waiting for him to respond to me to talk about it.
still nothing.
replied to others with snarky comments but no real discussion.
looks like a troll.
possibly russian?
anytime someone argues with you, simply say “what do you think they should do?
how do you think it could be made better?” and 9 times out of 10 the arguer will have no clue what they actually want you’re right.
he wants to ban gun mods like barrel shroud or stocks.
dude is nuts.
i would love it if you could quote me on that.
don't keep me waiting though.
you called me a russian troll because i didn't respond within 2 minutes.
lmao i replied.
bolt actions and revolvers.
muzzleloading marshmallow guns what about marshmallow bow and arrow?
drive by comments, so useful don't you think?
i mean, we don't know motives, the type of weapon used, or how the shooter got his gun.
its silly to figure out what would've stopped this when we don't know what started it.
what legislation would have prevented this?
i like how you think your stupid comments matter enough for people to “brigade you.” normally i'd agree with you, but seeing as a legitimate discussion i was having with someone got heavily downvoted, i can only assume a brigade.
been long enough on reddit to notice the patterns, mate.
first we should talk about parenting do we really trust the average parent to parent?
i don't think it's gone so well in the past.
“are we ready to talk about car control yet?” “are we ready to talk about alcohol control yet?” “are we ready to talk about cigarette control yet?” i get it, you’re looking for a place to put the guilt, but it’s not that simple sure it is.. you're just not willing to make a compromise.
you don't want a compromise, you want to ban and confiscate all guns.
sorry no deal did i say that at all ever?
those were your words.. i don't think we should ban all guns, that's just stupid.. you're now just projecting your fears.. instead of having a real conversation.
gun owners have given up a lot in the last 70 years: * 1934 national firearms act * registration of short barrels, automatic guns, suppressors * 1968 gun control act * can't sell guns across state lines.
* 1986 hughes amendment * closed the 1934 registry to machine guns.
no more automatic weapons sold at all commercially.
* 1993 brady bill * mandatory waiting period to buy a gun.
mandatory background check.
* 1994 assault weapons ban * banned cosmetic features which were easily circumvented.
expired in 2004. when are we going to get any of this rolled back?
most of the laws listed above aren't really stopping any crime, so if they're ineffective can we just get rid of them?
here's a few things gun owners want: * national concealed carry so we can carry our guns for person protection while we travel to visit family, jobs, etc.
* national "buy/own any guns you want as long as you don't murder someone, including automatics, short barrel rifle/shotguns, etc."
* gun suppressors removed from nfa registry so we can shoot quieter.
reduces noise pollution, helps protect hearing.
suppressors were only banned because people were using them to poach during the great depression to feed their families.
* private access to background checks to validate private buyers aren't felons/dangerous.
* faster appeals process so that anyone denied on background checks can get answers quickly and sort things out.
very often denials are clerical errors, but it takes lawyers and $10k+ and years of your life to get the fbi to talk to you and get things set straight.
they're currently processing appeals from late 2015 last i heard.
jesus lol.. honestly everything you've listed is a good thing.. and all the thing that gun owners want are seriously illogical and should be shot down.
we've got the worst problem with guns and gun deaths in the world.. we're the only country dealing with this level of violence.
so.. i think maybe we should continue regulations.. and probably ramp them up.
&gt; so.. i think maybe we should continue regulations.. and probably ramp them up.
have you ever tried to purchase a gun legally in california?
la county?
how should we ramp up regulations?
like what specifically?
about 60% of gun deaths in the us are suicide, so the number is already inflated to seem more problematic than it is.
are those people killing themselves because they have guns, or for other mental issues?
less than 1% of gun deaths are accidental.
of the remaining gun deaths, a large majority of the perpetrators are not using legal guns and not carrying legally.
&gt;we've got the worst problem with guns and gun deaths in the world well that's definitely not true.
brazil, where guns are restricted to people aged 25+ and pretty much only restricted to your house (no open or conceal carry unless you are law enforcement), their gun death rate is double that of the us.
have you looked at where gun deaths are most prevalent in the united states?
just how much research about gun laws, gun safety and gun crime statistics have you done yourself?
you mentioned that laws and regulations should be put into place, but are you really fully educated on what laws already exist?
you know ars in canada can be any length.
they can have a sbr without any paperwork.
they can also have a sawed off shotgun and it's 100% legal.
you do that in the us you would be lucky to not get 25 years in club fed.
&gt; we've got the worst problem with guns and gun deaths in the world.. we're the only country dealing with this level of violence.
that is completely incorrect.
automatic weapons are largely made inaccessible and since then you rarely see them used in crime; i wonder why 🤔 because there are only 182,619 transferrable machine guns, ranging from $14k to north of $200k.
exactly.
i'm not suggesting we follow the same path for semi automatics (i own many myself), but it would seem that the strategy did work over time; if not to remove them from circulation but at the very least to prevent further saturation, no?
where is this mandatory waiting period?
i never waited more than an hour.
also nothing illegal about selling interstate.
we do it all the time.
the mandatory waiting period existed between 1993 and 1998. the bill required the setup of an instant background check system, and the waiting period was a half-step while we waited on the fbi to build nics.
you cannot sell a gun to a resident of another state.
you need to have an ffl (federal firearms licensed seller) to run a background check and act as a middle man for interstate transactions.
https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/docs/0501-firearms-top-10-qaspdf/download yeah of course you go through a dealer.
i do for all transactions.
who said this?
not anyone here.
it's never a compromise.
when was the last time the pro-gun people got anything out of a "compromise"?
oh my god, you're acting like a child lol really?
that's what you consider acting like a child?
shh let the bodies cool before you push your agenda funny how that's never the case when there's a muslim terrorist attack.
it's "ban them all now!"
or when something happens with an illegal immigrant it's "build the wall!"
hmmm, i think you're undermining your own argument here.
clearly you don't agree with the stuff president trump does, so are you saying this because you would agree with gun owners that making cuts to constitutional liberties in the emotional aftermath of national tragedies is a bad idea?
i mean, shit, that's how we got the patriot act.
that's also why we imprisoned japanese-americans after pearl harbor.
if you're just looking for another way to say, "fuck trump", ok fine, but otherwise it sounds like you agree that the constitution should definitely be looked to as a support in times of tragedy, and not as if it's an obstacle i never made an argument, i think you're wrongfully assuming i'm op.
i'm merely commenting on the hypocrisy of people (usually conservatives) who always love to say it's "too soon" to talk about these things after a tragedy.
but as soon as something that aligns with their political ideology occurs, there is no such thing as too soon.
i never mentioned trump specifically, i just used those examples because it's low hanging fruit.
it's stuff you see in every comment thread on every social media or message board.
i actually don't support many gun regulations at all.
i just find it absurd that it's always "let the bodies cool" for gun control but as soon as something with a republican talking point comes up people are ready to have these conversations while the bodies are still laying in the street.
&gt; but as soon as something that aligns with their political ideology occurs, there is no such thing as too soon.
this is just a fucking stupid way to frame a conversation and it's all too easy to turn around.
if i wanted to use low-hanging fruit i could talk about the *numerous* times democrats wanted to ban guns or even a subsection of them, saying, "pfft, fuck the constitution.
it's old and i disagree with it and i want people to be safe!"
but when trump wants to put a temporary hold on immigrants from dangerous countries they say, he can't do that!
it's unconstitutional!"
so let's just state the obvious that there is a sea of opinions out there and if i needed to find one thing, *anything* to reinforce my personal bias against one group then i could do that easily.
so let's not be stupid and open up that gate?
yea, inevitably other people are going to do that, but that doesn't necessitate that you have to stoop down to it either.
when it's a islamic terrorist attack it's omg the islamaphobia is sooooo bad right now let’s just wait until the next shootings, so we can say its too soon again.
of course, that's the usual excuse.
and after the thoughts and prayers have been distributed, out comes the "this is not the time to discuss" excuse.
the desire to prevent further shootings is an *agenda*.
yikes, this country is in a very bad place at the moment.
did we break a record?
i think that the last mass shooting happened around 2 weeks ago.
progress from the weekly basis.
watching american news make me feel so lucky that i live in germany.
america is somewhere between a developed western nation and honduras.
the news you see online doesnt reflect daily life at all.
in reality we live in a pretty sweet ass place.
the news is always super blown out of proportion.
just so you know i wouldn't call mass shootings on a regular basis, some involving kids, blowing things out of proportion.
the worst bit is you think it's normal.
no we defiantly have crazy amounts.
i mean the news in general.
i dont live my life freaking out about something that is all over the news.
day to day life isn't as crazy as its made out to be.
we all go to work and lead normal lives for the most part.
comparing the us to honduras isn't accurate at all.
it is pretty creepy having a shooting at the school i just graduated from.
all my friends are meeting at football fields and parks to mourn.
we will heal and grow stronger over time.
things like these happen.
life will return to usual not too long from now.
we are a small town.
not much like this happens where we are so normal everyday life is actually pretty chillaxed.
usually its pretty well known that by the time you graduate college some of the student will die.
some in drunk driving accidents.
things of that nature.
my sophomore year one of my best friends committed suicide.
a couple years before that a football player was killed in a dd accident.
so its been a few years since anything happened.
death is pretty uncommon at our school.
i'm just glad there was only 2 dead not including the shooter.
we dont know his name yet.
they did confirm it was a male in their last conference.
no injuries.
i'm so glad our police station is only a couple blocks away.
their response time was less than a minute.
i think it was another student trying to get vengeance or payback.
i'm not sure until they release details after their investigation.
seems to me like you could kill more than 2 people in a minute unless your only goal is to kill those 2 people.
i checked on facebook and the 2 victims where indeed friends.
i dont know if their is more to the story than that.
information is really hard to nail right now.
everyone is just kinda repeating other people information at the moment.
i didn't know either 2 victims.
my sister new casey a little.
her mom and my mom are friends.
her mom owns a dog grooming business in town and grooms our dogs for free because my mom works for the animal shelter.
it has broken our little town but we are putting it back together with cement this time.
we are closer than ever.
also politics are extremely blown out of proportion.
yeah its usually true but no one really seems to talk about politics openly around here.
its just everyone yelling at each other on the internet.
things like that.
i think the politics being so crazy makes it easier for people to turn little problems into big ones.
things like that.
just know that normally every day life isn't nearly has chaotic as the news makes it out to be.
we are all mostly normal people.
its the crazies that make things seem crazy.
make sense?
i've has a rough morning so i'm sorry about any confusion or spelling mistakes and what have you!
most people don't live their lives freaking out to news, they usually identity a problem and work on a solution if it keeps happening.
if it happened to your loved ones you'd likely give it more thought.
you only have to look at the top comments in this thread to see what it means when it hits close to home.
my sister has been crying all day.
all my friends are in tears.
one of my befriends walked past the dead shooter.
i dont need you to tell me what hits close to home.
i have strong opinions on gun control as it is.
we are trying our best trying to get over this.
all of us.
if you have a problem arguing with people who have literally been dealing with this all day thinking our priorities aren't straight then i have news for you.
i live in a very conservative area and hopefully this event will help change peoples minds.
sadly i live in 1 of the 2 counties in my state that are majority republican.
the people here can't win a state vote as it is so i'm not too worried about it.
unless you have been in a situation where you have to pick up friends from mcgee park after your old school was just shot up because their parents won't pick up the phone then i dont want to hear your opinion on how i should view gun control.
you dont know my stance on gun control until now, dont act like it.
i've been going all day just to find out if all my friends are alive and i'd appreciate it if you'd lay the fuck off the politics until tomorrow at least.
ill be there supporting gun control with the rest of you.
right now i'm just glad all my friends are okay.
my sister however new casey somewhat.
i think she is okay though.
all we want is for people to comfort their family tonight.
you never know when they will disappear forever.
have a great fucking afternoon sir.
btw i am one of those top 5 comments.
so i do know exactly what its like also if you are not far their is a candle light ceremony thing behind minium park in aztec at 6. the more the merrier.
even if its only one person.
help spread the love i'm not allowed to have an opinion unless i suffer a tragic experience?
i'm sorry to hear about your day but it's up to all of you to work at change if you really want it.
if not then more families will have these days.
[deleted] it's a comment chain on a news story, if you want to grieve i suggest shutting reddit off and not going to a place where people want to discuss the issue.
we're not in a fucking vigil.
what better place to put my discussion than a news article where people can hear the opinion of someone who was actually here.
its better than a reporter who was told to say something.
i could probably give you better facts than youre hearing in the news if you really want me too.
i have friends with videos on fb of it going down.
students hiding behind desks, bulletholes, you name it.
you dont see that in the news articles yet dont you?
&gt; watching american news make me feel so lucky that i live in germany interesting, i feel the exact opposite its called stockholm syndrome :) at least we can now fully understand why it's called that... i just hope germany doesn't get as bad :( the reason that sweden has so many "rape" incidents is due to its very wide legal definition of rape.
its also because in sweden the vast majority of victims report the incidents (something that doesnt happen in us, which has a low report rate) you cant find these info with just a quick wiki [search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rape_statistics#united_states) i'm happy you live in germany too.
*typed from my ipad while being dragged under the axel of a jihadist's truck.
the perception that you trump supporters have for europe is laughably false.
i dont even know how you can believe this bs &gt; the perception that you trump supporters have for europe is laughably false.
said the european who thinks the united states sits "somewhere between a developed western nation and honduras."
holy hypocrisy.
having grown up in the uk and lived in france and switzerland and now the us, i can safely say that yes, the us is somewhere between a developed nation and honduras.
while he's a little ridiculous, have you seen video footage of the highways through france?
google the calais route for some information.
[deleted] well seeing as it was a kid he/she wasn't suppose to have a gun in the first place......... it was probably the parents gun and they didn't properly secure it.
no law could've stopped this if that was the situation.
how about laws requiring guns to be properly secured?
they already exist.
not in new mexico.
not feasible.
too many guns, not enough cops.
another day, another incident of gun violence in america ... can the u.s. ban guns already?
this is ridiculous.... australia did it and it works really well.
if we do ban guns would you be the one to go door to door taking them?
because anyone who took that job wouldn't have long to live.
naw, he's going to send another young man with a family and full life ahead of him to go confiscate all the guns.
but hey, the real win here is that u/dj2short feels better.
do you actually have any idea on how that would work (and undoubtedly fail) or do you think someone snaps their fingers, and they go away?
this is idiotic.
can we talk about banning free speech already?
this is ridiculous.
if people didn't say mean things to the kid he wouldn't have felt the need to act out violently.
agreed.
bullying is a direct result of the first amendment.
we need to do away with it for the safety of our children.
should just do this with every amendment.
"can we talk about forcing people to quarter soldiers in their homes already?
this is ridiculous.
if we had soldiers in people's homes, they wouldn't act out like this" ban guns?!
let's ban all crime while we're at it!!
brother, you're asking for a weekly ruby ridge scenario with shit like that.
oh yeah, sure, ban all guns.
and all those guys who you have made fun of for talking about how the government is going to ban their guns, i'm sure they'll take it real well when you do exactly what they knew you were going to do.
i think the easier solution would be to simply ban murder and crime.
if we could make that illegal than we'd all be safe.
/s only if you want a war to break out.
because things are so great in places line baltimore and chicago.
no.
you’re a fool if you think that can ever happen or hat it would fix anything.
gun education is extremely important.
even if you’re not going to own one i think everyone should take a basic gun safety class.
and mental health is important.
we need to help the people who feel like turning a gun on someone is their only option.
these people are sick.
sure if you personally volunteer to come round them up australia has more guns now than it did then.
also the decrease in homicide in australia since is similar to the rest of the developed world, us included, regardless of the nature of gun legality during the interim.
to do a buyback in the us for our guns would cost, at $100 per gun, roughly $40 *billion* dollars.
frankly given that the government is constitutionally obliged to pay "just compensation", the cost would likely be higher.
since most people didn't bother to read the article: &gt;moving production of the as-yet-unnamed electric suv to mexico will allow the carmaker to boost planned output of self-driving vehicles at its factory in flat rock, michigan.
ford is boosting its investment by $200 million and adding 150 more jobs to the michigan plant as part of the shift yeah, the self-driving investment is good news, but i'm wondering where does... &gt; “our growing ambitions in autonomous vehicles really means we don’t have room” for the electric vehicle at the flat rock factory, farley said.
“we had to come up with a different manufacturing strategy for our ev.” preclude them from producing this "as-yet-unnamed electric suv" elsewhere in michigan?
or somewhere else in the us?
probably a lack of available production plants space.
they have 2 other plants in michigan.
one of which builds the f150 so thats gotta be maxed out, and the other is going to switch from making focuses (foci?)
to the ranger and bronco.
not sure about the rest of the us whaaaaaaat?
ford is pretty brave to resuscitate the bronco.
i wonder if they'll offer it in white.
don't blame the corporation, they are just exploiting the laws that were put in place by politicians who are owned by shareholders!
i thought trump was stopping this?
if you're believing anything trump says, there's your first mistake.
i mean he did ~~build that wall~~ , ~~lock her up~~ , ~~been too busy to golf~~ , ~~release his taxes~~ , ~~release his findings into obama's brith certificate~~ , ~~release his healthcare plan where everyone is covered~~ , ~~label china a currency manipulator~~ , ~~brought back jobs~~ , ~~found those 3-5 "illegal" votes against him~~ , ~~ended nafta~~ ... he ended tpp,, and everyone else carried on, so there's that?
hurrah?
&gt; he ended tpp yeah he ended tpp and inadvertently replaced it with a pro-china one that we aren't included in but everyone else is well he did recognize jerusalem as israel's capital.
so there's that.
that's a way way easier promise to accomplish.
also not a smart one apperently which is why no one's done it.
&gt;not a smart one apperently which is why congress overwhelmingly voted for it?
congress is your standard for intelligence?
how about it being ratified into the democrat party platform in 2012?
what have you accomplished?
i had breakfast for two meals today.
&gt; also not a smart one apperently which is why no one's done it.
yeah, "no one's done it" isn't usually a great way to know whether or not something is good/smart.
things can be smart even if no one has done them before.
i have no idea whether or not this is actually a smart idea or not, but your reasoning is stupid.
this is not a smart idea.
people in the region are super pissed.
trump's reasoning for the decision was effectively "whatever we've been doing in the past hasn't been working, so let's see if poking everyone in the eye will work..." it wasn't really trump's idea if the plan was already written out and all he did was not put it on the backburner anymore.
and it's not like what we've been doing has been effective so i'll go ahead and see what we get here.
just because a plan is written down does not mean it is a good plan.
there's a reason it's been put on the back burner for so long.
you probably wouldn't be so cavalier about the consequences of the decision if you lived in the area it will affect.
i dunno, maybe you would.
"just because no one's done it doesn't mean it's a dumb idea" "well i mean it was already written down so it can't be that dumb an idea" ಠ_ಠ so if i write down that i'm going to blow up the sun, does that mean its a good idea?
people in that region have always been pissed though.
so really why keep giving a fuck, what are they gonna do protest more and kill each other.
ohh nooo mooooslims are mad, better do like the 3 things that do not make them mad.
fine i'll reword it.
i think shaking things around in that powder keg of an area is a bad idea.
&gt;yeah, "no one's done it" isn't usually a great way to know whether or not something is good/smart.
we're talking about politicians here though.
if you went around doing the exact opposite of what politicians have done for the past 30 years you'd be in pretty good shape.
90-0 was the vote.
maybe not smart, but it’s what congress voted for unanimously.
https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-resolution/176/text as expected.
never understood the hardon for israel really.
the arab world respects strength.
what they are trying now is just challenging to see if he is bluffing.
the only out come of this is that leads to peace is jerusalem as an international city, split like svalbard.
only to inflame the me again.
classic republican move.
mission accomplished!!
inflame the me again?
the middle east was always inflamed ever since the inception of islam.
ask any old school indian hindu.
they weren't all that surprised when 9/11 hit us.
they would say, "now you americans know what we've been dealing with for hundreds of years."
tax reform also about to get done.
trump promised no new taxes for the middle class but only the wealthy are getting a huge tax cut.
middle-class families are still fucked.
i’ll be helped along with most everyone i know.
i’m not bill gates either.
sounds like you haven’t done your research lol.
that's exactly what someone who has no clue what's happening says because daddy is a republican.
consider the article you're saying this on.
trump also promised better cheaper healthcare for every american.
do you spew that same shit reply to that promise?
are you going to cite any references or just be a dick?
&gt;sounds like you haven't done your research.
take your own advice.
people keep saying that's going to bring jobs back.
well not exactly ... what people?
and what are you refuting?
the michigan plant will instead be used for a self driving car with 150 more jobs added in michigan.
[cnbc](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/06/ford-makes-room-for-new-self-driving-vehicle-moving-ev-production-to-mexico.html) trump threatened an import tax on vehicles made by american companies in foreign counties.
let's see what happens now.
you thought a businessman who is now also a politician would keep his promises?
just...lol the only thing trump has stopped is the ability to achieve an erection trump signs laws, congress writes them.
trump is working on this, unlike other presidents who think it's just great to move jobs oversees.
&gt;trump is working on this specifically what is he doing?
&gt;unlike other presidents who think it's just great to move jobs oversees.
such as?
at *worst* this has been passively accepted in the past.
&gt; specifically what is he doing?
playing golf at mar-a-lago.
and, you know, "golf" is the brand of a car.
and we're talking about car jobs here.
so, there you go!
you deep-state people will never give up trying to undermine our dear president, will you??
/s &gt; golf" is the brand of a car.
the name of a german car that's, i believe, made in germany by germans.
also made in mexico by mexicans.
but that wall will keep them out.
damn golfs always trying to break down my shitty wall!
jeepers.
are hondas made in mexico too?
or do they just use chinese slavery or?
good chance that your new honda is either made in greensburg, in or marysville, oh.
i don't have a *new* honda :0( i have an old acura (0: love this comment!
i have to use the reddit forbidden emojies to show how i feel: 👍 great point, had to downvote for the /s though.
absolutely kills the joke when you spell it out right after telling it.
don't expect a reply from a trumpster they have an empty bag of air... during the campaign season trump was floating ideas of having massive tariffs on imported goods, such as vehicles, to make it more profitable to have manufacturing centers in the us rather than building vehicles outside of the us and then importing.
at least to me, floating ideas around during the campaign does not satisfy the definition of "working" in the context of someone who has since taken office.
i have not seen any significant push from trump or the gop congress to get this done, let alone specifics.
the most i've seen is discussion over tariffs on chinese solar panels.
it would be extremely difficult for him to get the gop on board with having tariffs, as they like free trade, and even the democrats don't want tariffs.
i would expect that there will be a stronger push for tariffs from him during his second and third year in office.
&gt; at worst this has been passively accepted in the past.
sexual assault by powerful people has been passively accepted in the past, what is your point?
wrong is wrong.
when obama or clinton said that the country wasn't ready for gay marriage, that didn't make it right, that was weak ass leadership.
so, again, what is trump trying to do to stop companies from outsourcing jobs?
yeh but what about obama and clinton?
uhhh...what?
what part confuses you?
that part where democrats didn't support gay marriage?
it's true you know.
the part where gay marriage has something to do with us manufacturing.
it's called poor leadership.
poor leadership leads to nafta and bad china trade deals.
bad leadership is someone who says they didn't support gay marriage because the country wasn't ready.
you specifically mention: &gt;other presidents who think it's just great to move jobs oversees.
which presidents are you talking about?
not to mention, this isn't like sexual assault.
passively accepting that jobs are going to be outsourced is not necessarily a bad thing, if you believe it'll be more effort than it is worth to keep them here in the first place instead of expanding other industries or investing in things that will create new jobs in the future.
if that works or not is an issue that is separate from a president accepting that jobs will be outsourced.
&gt; which presidents are you talking about?
clinton started with nafta both bushes were on board, and obama seemed to think it was the right move too.
&gt;passively accepting that jobs are going to be outsourced is not necessarily a bad thing, why not?
it's almost as if you are making a conscious decision that those vulnerable people aren't worth saving.
if you are going to bring in low skilled immigrants into this country, you need to have low skilled jobs available for them.
it is not good policy to move low skilled jobs out of the country and bring in low skilled people.
&gt; trump signs laws, congress writes them.
presidents are fully capable of writing legislation and asking congress to pass it.
&gt;trump is working on this, unlike other presidents who think it's just great to move jobs oversees.
by making sure his ties are made in china, or tweeting at nordstrom for not selling his daughter's overseas made crap?
or is it the golfing?
is the golfing helping?
&gt; trump is working on this trump isn't working on shit but fattening his own pockets.
anyone who believes differently is a fucking idiot.
let's be honest here, trump doesn't really work at all.
he signs a couple of papers and waddles back to a golf course.
didn't we just give them a yuuuuuge tax cut so they would move their mfg here???
that was for the ford focus factory, electric suv factory was never discussed.
he's talking about the tax bill that passed the senate i assume.
ford didn't get any special treatment.
uh what?
ford is intentionally taking jobs from americans and giving them to foreign workers in order to save a few bucks.
you would think americans with a hard on for patriotism would raise more of a shitshow about these sorts of things.
we shouldn’t be defending corporations that fuck over americans just because corporations inherently strive to make more money at all costs and it isn’t explicitly illegal for them to do so in this way.
we could just not buy the vehicles.
you and what army?
the 501st imperial dodge durangos.
the california canyoneros probably the ones with the calvin pissing on car logos stickers.
*since you asked...* - elon musk call me when the regular joe can afford one, elon.
patience.
everything's expensive at first.
how long did it take for the regular joe to afford a car instead of another horse?
you'll be able to afford oen just as soon as tesla figures out how to weld steel chassis.
everybody makes their own decisions, and i'm not sure i'll buy another ford.
i hear nissan makes trucks in mississippi, and they are pretty good.
the full sized nissans are a nope depends on what you need it for.
toyota has a good reputation too.
&gt; twitter silence &gt; &gt; trump did not tweet his displeasure this summer with hackett’s plan to build small cars in china to be exported to the u.s., nor has he blasted the automaker after news broke wednesday of the electric suv’s shift to mexico.
it's been said they took twitter away from him.
he’s been tweeting this morning so might wanna check your source how do you know he made the tweets?
notice how they're coherent and inoffensive.
yeah, i should have known it was too good to be true.
his latest tweets have been coherent.
i’m convinced someone other than him have been sending them.
the china plant can be for china market but the mexico plant is for the us market so trump should react on the latter.
his money laudering lawyer now has it... no way, really?
make mexico great again lol.
“they have to do what’s best financially and this electric vehicle is not going to be huge” followed by... “we’re going for it.
we think electrification is a significant shift in propulsion for our industry.” so the entire industry is heading that way, but it's not going to be "huge"?
trickle down economics.
it went and trickled all the way down to mexico.
success!
i hope they can driver over that wall.
so mexico can build them for less than we can, and we get to buy a cheaper product while pursuing higher-value activities.
where's the problem?
edit: thanks for the responses.
i'm personally of the opinion that people cannot retrain quickly enough to find alternative employment in the modern age.
this will definitely hurt the local economy in michigan, although i don't know how to possibly rectify it.
i never understood the dichotomy of "we're going to bring back jobs to the us!"
while "we have to let the free market decide!"
it's like the expectation falls short on the global stage.
if you're a business, and a vendor says "i can produce 100 smartphones for $200" while another says "i'll do it for $100 and same quality" - you're not going to give a shit what country the vendor is in.
chinese factories have suicide nets.
americans wouldn't think twice to work in one that has one.
which is also the reason the iphone will never be made here.
i jump on breitbart every now and then and it seems like this is a concept that everyone has an issue with.
on one hand they want no regulations to business, yet they want to limit the cheap labor pool (immigration) and where business can operate (sending work abroad).
i don't understand how you can have both.
it's like the imaginary mexican that's lazy but simultaneously stealing your job.
it's just not possible.
it's the biggest sense of entitlement all americans have.
we don't believe in sweat shop labor or slave labor.
even where slave labor is used, i.e.
prisons, that cheap labor is used for everything from tech support to fighting fires in california.
no surprise why we have the largest prison population.
it's called nationalism.
&gt; which is also the reason the iphone will never be made here.
actually, mit did a calculation and showed that making one here would cost an additional.. $10 or so?
https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601491/the-all-american-iphone/ so apple must decide between paying $0 extra or $2.1 billion extra.
$10 x 211000000 (number of iphones produced in 2016) pretty sure anyone in their right mind would go for the former.
it has a lot to do with comparative advantage.
it's advantageous for apple to do it this way, because it's allowed.
if every company in a particular market, say the north american market, were required to source 80% of a product's parts from that same market, we could start to see some progress.
remove the competitive pressure pushing companies towards bad practices and it will naturally resolve.
edit: this is an idea that has been in place for decades in the firearm community.
a certain # of parts must be made in america or your gun is a felony.
(not yelling, caps for emphasis on felony status.
please don't fuck around with stuff like this.
i worked for one of the biggest firearms stores in the nation and it's really super important.
atf / batfe don't play.)
not only that, it's also because the support structure (engineering / design / logistics / supply chain) is just not as convenient in the us than china.
in china where the phones are being produced, the suppliers are right around the corner, and they can get a sample, or inspect the manufacturing line in matter of hours.
in us, the turn around time is days.
not only that, since the engineers live on site of the factory, it's much easier and faster to do a redesign should a problem arise.
http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html an excerpt: &gt;one former executive described how the company relied upon a chinese factory to revamp iphone manufacturing just weeks before the device was due on shelves.
apple had redesigned the iphone's screen at the last minute, forcing an assembly line overhaul.
new screens begin arriving at the plant near midnight.
a foreman immediately roused 8,000 workers inside the company's dormitories, according to the executive.
each employee was given a biscuit and a cup of tea, guided to a workstation and within half an hour started a 12-hour shift fitting glass screens into beveled frames.
within 96 hours, the plant was producing over 10,000 iphones a day.
manufacturing will never come back to the us unless americans are willing to live like this.
it's much better to focus on invention and innovation rather than pursuing these long work hours yet low pay jobs.
doesn't this eventually go out of the realm of business and into the quality of life in foreign governments?
if a ruthless dictator forced a third of their population into sweatshops, businesses would be chomping at the bit to get in on the cheap labor.
businesses would turn a blind eye because it's not in their capacity, nor interest, to govern and stop it since they're just a customer of that country.
i think the only way to resolve this is for an a global work standard to be adopted and enforced.
if one set of employees expect good healthcare while another expect a simple food ration, i imagine the latter will always get hired simply because they expect less.
seems almost pointless to try and fix this from within the borders of any one country.
&gt; were required to source 80% of a product's parts from that same market, we could start to see some progress.
google 'rules of origin', you're not the first to come up with the idea.
that assumes they couldn't pass the added 10 bucks on to the end user.
looking at the way cell phones are sold, i doubt 10 extra bucks would meant difference to sales at all.
don't spin it that way.
how much profit per phone?
$400?
(this is a real number) so $390 isn't enough?
going by your figure.
$82.3b isn't sufficient profit.
that is your position.
tariffs are essentially just subsidies on us employment.
the difference between us taxing imports from mexico and us charging extra sales tax on the same products and spending it on make-work programs is that the former will cause a trade war.
its because they dont care about any of that shit and just use the talking points to persuade voters the dichotomy you're referencing here is in the details.
the correct way to bring back jobs in this context is not through some sort of subsidy or tariff (anti natural market forces) it through making it more competitive to do business in the united states (through tax cuts and regulation controls) which are consistent with free market.
unless you have to abolish the minimum wage and all the labor laws people have fought for over the last two centuries them manufacturing is just never going to be competitive in america.
were competing with sweatshops.
this is where the government policy needs to be set.
this is more important than mandating people buy health insurance.
but the people who run the government listen to the people trying to make iphones and since they give more money to politicians than the guy in the factory, they screw thew guy in the factory.
the gop says the free market has to decide - the libtards want to have some protection measures in place to keep jobs here.
trump being the thief that he is took the talking points away and yet, delivers the gop style of fuck you america.
where are all those "higher value" jobs that millions of americans need and are looking for?
they don't exist.
this is the point.
:d the rate of re-education and re-training is fast outstripping people's ability to re-learn.
so what do we do?
if we install protectionist tariffs we get left behind in the global economy.
rethink the notion that people have to work full time in order to be allowed to survive independently?
i understand the concept behind ubi, but the balance between first work and third world countries is not there yet.
we cannot pull off ubi in our lifetimes.
also, i imagine everyone who has to live off of only ubi will end up living in giant apartment slums.
i seriously doubt everyone will get a single family house.
i'm sorry but it's a pipe dream.
i am for better labor laws, earned paid leave for all workers, and healthcare for all, but not ubi.
it seems to end with everyone who does not own means of production living in squalor and competing for lowest bidder part time jobs.
the obvious solution then is for everyone to own means of production.
the low skilled workers who used to build those cars now have no job.
it's easy to say do better, but then there is reality.
i assume you have a masters degree, don't you?
why not?
&gt; the low skilled workers who used to build those cars now have no job.
...who will then get further pissed off, decide to take the easy route and blame migrants, foreigners, and other scapegoats, and then vote for the next fascist into office who promises they'll fix everything by putting america first.
and then the cycle will repeat again.
we have a winner!
the rate of advancement and re-training is fast exceeding most people's ability to cope.
i don't know what the solution is, but manipulating the market to try and stay the inevitable is only distorting things further, and really hurting a lot of people who don't know better.
this director of it's heart breaks for everyone who's unable to support themselves, or have access to proper healthcare, because of the system we are all subject to in this country.
and this is only going to grow over the coming years as automation takes away more and more jobs.
vehicle drivers and what few factory workers we have left are going to be gone in a relatively short time frame.
couple that with the government ensuring that healthcare costs are going to continue to escalate out of reach and you're going to have some people ready to take up pitchforks.
and they will attack the easiest target they can find.
this country is in for a really difficult time over the next several decades, perhaps much longer.
this problem is because we allowed factories to leave.
the solution should have been better trade agreements.
even with automation, it's better to have those factories here.
agreed.
not retaining the means of production can be a achilles tendon.
one small cut and we're immobile.
you are off a bit i think.
from my own experience it is not the average poor slob (myself included) that says the foreigners, migrants blah blah blah are making life harder for them but other people usually people who are elitist snobs who put those words into the mouths of the lower classes.
people they deem unworthy, uncouth or any other measure of human degradation.
plenty of your people voted trump.
plenty of my people (libtard elites) wanted to fund better social programs, single payer health care and infrastructure upgrades that would have employed millions.
but no, the dumb effing white poors went for trump.
sorry assholes.
i still have my degree and high paying tech job on the west coast.
i tried to vote for a better option than trump, but too many easily conned "working people" fell for trumps lies instead.
and you guys will suffer the worst because of it.
wow, this guy really hates poor people.
do i?
i thought i loved poor people, because they're often victims of a complex system they don't understand.
because masters degrees are useless for most people the point is how much is the poster willing to change their life?
we live in a society that has very ambitious people and some very lazy people, that is just how life works.
to say those lazy people just need to step up is short sighted.
if it was that easy, nobody would get a d in school, someone would tell the student to do better and it would just happen.
you make it sound like laziness is the only reason people don't do well in school.
some people just learn hands on and can't learn about things easily just by reading about them.
they might be able to build/fix your car but can't understand the theory of evolution or analyze literature or read good and stuff.
that doesn't mean we should just throw them away, it wouldn't work anyways.
they know how to fix things, have you ever seen mad max?
you are making my point.
closing the place where they did physical labor, and telling them to get an education and a better job is ridiculous.
but that's is what people say is the solution to outsourcing jobs.
k well my point was that doesn’t make them lazy.
they will find a way to survive and you might not like how they do it.
go visit detroit sometime.
lazy is a bad term and i probably shouldn't have used it.
but those people have different motivations.
there is a segment of society that is willing to work, but not willing to sacrifice home life for it.
that means no secondary formal education, but that doesn't mean that they aren't smart or can't work.
but if you've been welding your whole life and you lose your job, you probably aren't real interested in programming.
&gt; telling them to get an education and a better job is ridiculous the world isn't static, plan ahead and adapt.
if it was that simple we wouldn't have poverty.
you cannot make people do shit, you can suggest, you can help, but in the end they make their choices.
i used to think like that, but with my 50 years of experience i know not all people will do that.
i have family members that i have tried to help, but they do what they want to do.
we have immigrants that won't learn the local language, what do you do with them?
society isn't set up to help the wealthy, but to help the poor.
nafta does not help the poor, it helps the wealthy, and an attitude of "plan ahead and adapt" while instituting nafta, gets president trump elected.
what do these low-skilled workers do then?
if exported manufacturing doesn't cost them their jobs then automation definitely will soon.
what we need to do is somehow get these low-skilled workers to vote for people who propose job retraining instead of government welfare for dying industries.
i'm not sure how we do that since some number of them actively [reject](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-effect-coal-retraining-insight/awaiting-trumps-coal-comeback-miners-reject-retraining-iduskbn1d14g0) the retraining that is available now.
we certainly can't coddle them forever with promises to "bring back jobs" because a large number of low-skilled jobs just aren't going to exist in the near future.
these are people that will end up on welfare and, if we're really careless, contribute to the opioid epidemic when they turn to drugs out of desperation.
&gt; what do these low-skilled workers do then?
if exported manufacturing doesn't cost them their jobs then automation definitely will soon.
not necessarily.
some can be re-trained, but others will acquire new skill sets.
instead of shutting down a plant and moving to mexico, they automate the plant in michigan.
those don't run by themselves, they still need people.
yes fewer people, but they are needed.
the machines to do automation?
can't we build them?
- jobs.
can't we maintain them?
jobs.
can't we re-program them when they need a different task?
jobs.
all those jobs we sent away, of various skills.
now that we have sent those jobs, if we bring them back, we have construction jobs.
but mexico becomes more wealthy and will probably consume more goods imported from the us and spend tourism dollars here, creating jobs.
whether that trade off is worth it is up for debate but globalism isn't just about moving jobs to a cheaper place and everything else staying the same.
that is the theory, but does it work in practice?
the numbers say no.
look at exports via imports.
this is good for ford, and for those who buy fords, nobody else.
i'm going to call this "tour down economics".
a ton of people depend on those jobs.
have you ever been to detroit?
go to detroit and ask around.
if dealing drugs is a higher-value activity than your absolutely right.
ford already builds their cars in other countries.
anyone who thinks ford are “american cars” anymore is out of touch.
i’m surprised they were building them in michigan to start with, to be honest.
ford is american in name only at this point.
similar to apple’s packaging: “designed in california.
made in china.” except at least that’s more honest.
ford is a scummy company with a low quality product.
no surprise here.
while our roads and schools crumble, who will inherit this awful country?
you, me, and dupree.
*(just humming the tune to i'm proud to be an american)* *(while listening to a 4th of july and president's day sale commercial)* *(while reading a be american buy american bumper sticker)*
good riddance, the stuff this guy did children and teenagers who trusted him was horrifying.
good.
i hope all the shitheads at usag who covered it up and failed to report end up going down too.
steve penny, the karolyis... they knew.
i hope so, the systematic enablement of this is as disgusting as the act itself.
it’s either that or gross negligence on oversight and both are unacceptable.
i'm pretty sure i read that some of the women who testified against him/spoke out about him said that they did report it to their parents and leadership of usag.
i believe strongly that those in power at usag knew about it for years and intentionally covered it up, especially given the favoritism/power dynamics that go on in that organization.
good (accidental) job to the driver of the trash truck on that day.
they should get a vacation, who knows how many other cases will be made in their absence!
lucky him-- one of those gym dads would probably make him pay if he were on the outside what a loser.
i hope this fuck running for office in al gets a gavel to the taint before he can do damage to our republic.
something tells me it's going to get it hard in prison.
he's small, and he touched a child.
that's a lose/lose for him lol.
he's either going to be in adseg/the hole/pc the rest of his life (which is 23hrs a day lockdown, 365) so no one kills or rapes him, or he's going to get raped and beat to death in general population.
a well deserved sentence.
why not just kill him?
an eyewitness said the victim said to the paramedic "then why does it hurt?"
after being accused of faking it.
can you imagine being shot with a gun and having a school yard debate with the only person who can save your life, trying to convince them you are injured?
that is so sad.
can someone correct me if im wrong but, i dont think they are supposed to argue about it.
they are just supposed to do their job.
have you talked to many ems workers lately?
i was recently talking to a suicidal ems paramedic who was suicidal because he couldn't afford to rent a home for his family and was barely able to fix up a trailer for them to live in.
corporations search for the absolute cheapest workers regardless of their qualifications.
20 years ago being ems was a middle class job.
now it's been turned into the burger flipper of the medical world, and the older more qualified ems workers are being forced out or into other jobs.
yup.
ems are chewed up and spat out.
after about five minutes of doing it, you've had it with people's bullshit.
some other stuff i found: - yosif was taking part in a religious ceremony at a mosque in hamilton.
he stepped outside and noticed two men harassing an older man.
yosif verbally called them out, and he was in turn shot by one of the two other men.
- dale burningsky, 19, is the primary suspect as of now with a second degree murder charge.
two middle aged men harrassing an older man.
yosif called them out, one of the two middle aged men shoots yosif, and now dale burningsky, a 19 year old is a suspect?
what?
oops, you’re right!
one site said middle aged, and then then they released their first suspect.
didn’t edit after, thanks!
they also pretended he was white.
don't expect facts from the cbc.
paramedics said on scene he was shot with a pellet gun, they arrested a suspect, no word in the article on whether or not it was a pellet gut.
note also that pellet guns have about the power of a .22 lr caliber round which is still lethal.
less likely of course than something bigger but still lethal.
a pellet gun is significantly more powerful than a bb gun which will penetrate skin and hurt like a sob i have a .22 pellet rifle that shoots 1300 feet per second.
it can shoot all the way through a metal street sign at around 50-60ft away (using a no lead, alloy pellet).
i have a .30 air rifle too that only shoots about 550 feet per second but it will still go through a piece of ply wood at 50 yards.
canada has a 500 fps limit on most pellet/ bb guns, regardless of caliber.
you’ll need a firearm permit to buy anything faster.
i can’t remember the full name of the license.
in new jersey if you have a plastic $10 spring-action airsoft gun you can technically be charged with possession of an unlicensed firearm if you don't register possession and acquisition license, or pal for short.
most people will be fine just calling it a firearms license.
there are companies that make .50 caliber airguns capable of taking game as large as a whitetail deer.
people in my area by .177 airguns to take out rats or iguanas.
these are serious weapons and not toys to fuck around with.
yep.
the big bore pcp (pre-charged pneumatic) air rifles/pistols are no joke.
the .50 cal ones are nuts.
fully legal for anyone to own, felon or not.
that is actually how i found out about them.
i had a felony for marijuana cultivation, so i checked them out and got a pcp.
multiple shots, even semi auto ones now.
there are even automatic .50 ones, made by evanix, harder to find though and expensive.
[pyramyd air](https://www.pyramydair.com/search-results-ext?ntt=evanix&amp;sid=1375a617a415&amp;n=0&amp;ntk=primary&amp;q=evanix&amp;cx=002970863286801882398:jlcminxfwdw&amp;cof=forid:11;nb:1&amp;sasearch) sells many of their models and dang are they pricey.
you can own black powder guns too, right?
no, at least not in california.
anything using gunpowder to shoot a projectile is considered a firearm in california and is illegal for felons to possess.
anyone saying different doesn't know the law in california.
for the down voters: 12021.
(a)(1) any person who has been convicted of a felony under the laws of the united states, of the state of california, or any other state, government, or country, or of an offense enumerated in subdivision (a), (b), or (d) of section 12001.6, or who is addicted to the use of any narcotic drug, who owns, purchases, receives, or has in his or her possession or under his or her custody or control any firearm is guilty of a felony.
and the definition of a firearm is: 12001(b) as used in this title, "firearm" means any device, designed to be used as a weapon, from which is expelled through a barrel a projectile by the force of any explosion or other form of combustion.
(c) as used in sections 12021, 12021.1, 12070, 12071, 12072, 12073, 12078, 12101, and 12801 of this code, and sections 8100, 8101, and 8103 of the welfare and institutions code, the term "firearm" includes the frame or receiver of the weapon.
(e) for purposes of sections 12070, 12071, and paragraph (8) of subdivision (a), and subdivisions (b), (c), (d), and (f) of section 12072, the term "firearm" does not include an unloaded firearm that is defined as an "antique firearm" in section 921(a)(16) of title 18 of the united states code.
muzzleloaders and black powder guns are considered firearms in ca.
there is no exemption for "felon in possession of an antique firearm" anyone saying you can be a felon and own black powder or muzzleloading guns in ca has not researched the topic.
i was a felon in ca until i got my record cleared by the state with prop 64. don't get yourself in trouble for lack of research.
ah, i didn't realize what state you were in.
well, at least you have something (for now, i'm sure that "loophole" is gonna be closed soon).
you are correct.this situation is specific to the handling of felons, and less of a firearms law.
legally, felons in ca aren't even supposed to possess replica firearms and airguns.
which are clearly not classified as a firearm, but specifically detailed in the stipulations of their release.
holy shit, what brand is that?
i just bought the gamo fusion mach 1 whisper.
amazing how far technology has come, these things are definitely lethal.
umarex octane .22 gas piston.
1000fps with lead pellets.
1300fps with alloy.
the .30 is hatsan 135 qe vortex gas piston.
i have an air rifle that literally takes the heads off of squirrels with hollow point pellets.
they're definitely capable of lethality.
yep.
i have a friend who blew his big toe off with one.
that's funny, i blew off the top of my index finger with one.
i thought i was the only retard that had to explain that to an er doctor.
my grandfather did that too.
he was trying to drunkenly prove to his friend that you could stop the pellet by plugging the barrel with your finger.
turns out he was wrong.
if only you could use an analog like a corndog or something.
instructions unclear.
name checks out that's nice, but where do you find squirrels with hollow point pellets?
they usually run around with nuts.
deez nuts.
got em.
does any one know if paramedics could be charged for involuntary manslaughter on this?
this is right they should have at least tired to treat him.
have the power of a .22 lr?
you have never shot a gun before have you?
i have like 15 while this is true, many times .22 will also not even penetrate.
it really is a case by case basis surprisingly did you seriously just say a .22 sometimes won't penetrate skin or am i misreading?
only if your sometimes consists of a 1 mile shot at somebody with some seriously armor-like clothes on or the .22 is firing blanks!
i think it's always going to break the skin, but there have been one or two cases of people getting shot in the head with a .22 in just the right spot and the bullet bouncing off.
from what i had heard .22 penetration can be an issue, of course i may be wrong... these are just from friends who are hunters.
a .22 has more than enough power to reliably penetrate skin and (not as reliably) kill.
with that said, it is low enough power to do things like richochet off bones of large animals (like humans), so that is probably what your friends were referring to.
never going to not penetrate skin with a .22 under normal circumstances.
ah, til are these men hunting rhino?
because .22 has always been able to penetrate human skin.
i guess it wouldn't penetrate rhino skin very easily, though... .22 will not be a viable hunting caliber, unless its very small game like rat or squirel .
that being said it can be lethal to humans at even 500ft.
burningsky?
sounds first nation.
what a conundrum for canada.
&gt;he estimates 20 minutes passed before they put him in the ambulance and took him to st. joseph's hospital, where he died around 10 p.m. &gt;"he was promptly taken to the hospital, from what i understand," he said.
hm 20 minutes doesn't seem too prompt to me, especially for a gunshot wound.
they also took him to the wrong fucking hospital.
they took him to a regular hospital when there was a trauma center even closer.
which would've been the right place to take someone with a gunshot wound.
i guess pellet gun wounds don't get that kind of treatment.
20 minutes does seem long.
but if he was under the care of emt or paramedic during that time it's not necessarily indicative of negligence.
they could have been working on him during that time.
however, telling someone that's shot is "acting" definitely is.
any emt or paramedic worth their salt knows their primary job is to get the patient to a doctor/er unless they are already dead.
and even then they'll usually keep up resuscitation for the sake of being thorough and for the family.
source: volunteer firefighter who watches ems work all the time.
there are stories where the paramedics told him to stop acting, walk it off.
that was from the neighbors, who were doing interviews on tv.
why don't you google the distance between his location and the hospital.
ambulances drive fast, but can't break physics/go through cars man.
i think they were saying the paramedics were on the scene for 20 minutes before taking him away, not that it took 20 minutes between the time of the call and when they left with him.
yeah, it seems odd.
it looks like he was mainly bleeding out internally causing the paramedics pause since the wound seemed too small for a bullet hole.
paramedics though are trained to assess, seems like they got it wrong and fucked up by trying to save the kid money because ambulance rides are expensive as fuck.
they weren't trying to *save money* for anyone.
come on now.
an ambulance ride is $45 in ontario.
these paramedics just fucked up big time.
this was in canada, he wouldn't of had to pay for anything.
the paramedics didn't want to treat the brown guy with the name al-hasnawi not true.
i know it varies by jurisdiction, and i don't live in ontario, but i had an ambulance ride a few years back in alberta.
cost me $375 if i recall properly.
first responders take patients to hospitals not by proximity but by specialization and the facility’s capacity.
taking a patient who is emergent from a gsw to a hospital without a trauma center because it’s closer is a beginners mistake at best.
the hospital was further away then the trauma center.
so then taking a patient who is emergent from a gsw to a hospital without a trauma center when it's farther, like in this case, would be negligent at best.
yeup, depending on the country’s ems protocols but i can’t imagine it would not be considered so.
i guess they could try and argue that the patient did not seem emergent, but that’s probably a stretch it was 20 minutes before they put him in the ambulance, could you perhaps elucidate how the laws of physics preclude loading him in to the ambulance any faster than that?
first responders sound criminally negligent.
it's because the ems companies are hiring the cheapest possible workers.
you would be astonished at how many ems workers are $10 an hour employees living in trailer parks, or even minimum wage volunteers who work part time at local grocery stores or other low paid jobs.
corporations don't give a shit about anything but their bottom line.
paramedic wages in canada range from $70-$100k/yr.
those medics should lose their job and license depends.
if it was negligence, then yes.
if it was criminal negligence, then they should be looking at jail time.
if it was neither, then nothing.
the article is not completely clear on what seems to be the case yet.
"nothing" is correct only if you'd be happy to see this happen again.
at the minimum they need some strong feedback on how to do better.
so sad just put him in the vehicle and get him to the hospital and let the doctors figure it out.
he probably could have lived too.
were paramedics racist, or merely incompetent idiots?
it's not clear.
likely classist.
it's not the worst neighbourhood, but also not the best.
probably idiots, if they thought he was just acting.
this may be hard to believe, but ems workers are often so poorly paid that they often have to live in trailer parks or the projects.
many ems workers only make $10 an hour.
many ems are volunteers only paid minimum wage for the time they are responding, and have to work second jobs.
this is especially the case in rural areas.
corporations have absolutely destroyed the ems industry for their own profit.
that might well be true in the us, but not in canada, where this incident took place.
parmedic wages in ontario start at $70k/yr.
my bad.
well, i was shocked to learn how low wages are in the states, so i appreciate the info.
&gt; his hair was long with a ponytail wrapped at the top of his head.
i believe that is called a bun.
utterly shameful form of conduct [deleted] first degree is when you have a deliberate plan that you execute, 2nd degree is an in the moment purposeful act of murder.
makes sense to me correct me if i'm wrong, but isn't everyone in hamilton an actor?
"amin al-tahir, a director at the al-mostafa islamic centre, said he witnessed paramedics telling al-hasnawi he was fine, and that he was acting."
someone says they said this.
it could have happened exactly like he says, but there's so much room for error in this little game of telephone.
a paramedic telling a distressed person "you're fine" to calm them down is quite reasonable.
unless "you're acting" is some canadian idiom with which i am not familiar, i highly doubt those are the actual words used by the paramedic.
is this a joke?
you can't possible believe a paramedic or public servant is negligent or racist that you suggest "you're acting" may be some canadian colloquial saying you are unaware of?
do you think "whites are the superior race" is a cute saying that some klansman say and you are not quite sure what it means?
you should read the post you reply to instead of spazzing out over your lack of comprehension.
well i think that it isn't a saying i haven't heard of.
i'm saying that i have never in my life heard another human being tell someone "you're acting" to mean "you're faking", "you're lying", "you're being dramatic".
i work with a lot of people who have learned english as a second (or third) language, and what it sounds like to me is an esl speaker paraphrasing something the paramedic said, so we have the media said that this guy said that another guy said.
do i find it impossible that a canadian paramedic is racist?
(i believe this is what you're trying to get at).
not at all.
i am merely playing devil's advocate, because i am always 100% suspicious of a news article.
wait until one is written about you, and you will see how inaccurate they are.
agree about the inaccuracies especially with the cbc hamilton desk.
they often misname the mountain accesses.
"someone says they said this etc..." so the witnesses are lying or mistaken?
it's possible.
or the journalist who got the story from the witness.
or the intern who probably typed it all up.
who knows how many sets of mouths and ears are in-between.
it's a game of telephone.
ah so there is no approximation of objective truth possible at all ever.
gotcha.
just a silly question but are there security cameras?
yes but one was disabled by someone before the event and the other one only catches people running to the scene of the murder but not the murder itself.
thank you for the answer.
i hope they get charged with criminally negligent manslaughter the musical?
my first thought too, but no, the city is named hamilton.
if he had had a gun himself he may have been able to protect himself.
criminals do bad things with weapons of all types.
[removed] the people that do this aren't going to go away once the "muslims are gone".
they will turn their attention to the next group.
gays, jews, this, that.
you should think about returning to your mothers' womb, you ignorant fuck.
stupid and ignorant people hate things they don't understand or things they are told to fear.
in hamilton?
i hear he kept saying "i am not throwing away my shot!"
without reading the article, i'm going to guess he was somali.
nope.
first nations.
name is dale burningsky king.
damn, ya win some you lose some.
rip to dude, ambulance services across the country are shit reliable.
not blaming the actual drivers.
well to be fair, piles of money would burn pretty quickly and spread the fire clearly their firefighters are just more productive than the firefighters of poor people.
&gt;more than 350 firefighters, 52 engines and six fixed-wing aircraft are working to contain skirball, according to the los angeles times.
that’s around 20 percent of the total number of fire engines operated by the los angeles county and city fire departments, though it’s unclear what percentage it is of all resources being diverted to the fire, including from outside sources.
skirball currently stretches around 475 acres, less than one percent of the total area aflame.
even the one percent's one percent portion of a wildfire gets special treatment.
do the insurance companies pay for this added protection?
what you are seeing is what it looks like when someone actually gets something for their taxes.
i pay as much taxes as most average households, yet even i don't get anything from it.
truly wealthy people get their asses wiped for them by the government using money from other people, even small business owners like myself.
it's bs.
my employees and myself don't even get medical from that.
we don't get proper police protection.
what the hell do we get?
i pay a road tax and water bills, so not even that comes from the main taxes.
wtf are we paying for???
you're paying for the welfare of your betters!
by god, they're job creators!
they need to be coddled and loved like enormous toddlers in their gilded cages, lest their homes burn down and they come to rip ours down and to build new ones.
you're saying wealthy people don't pay more in taxes?
that's at least the impression: "if you look at the forbes 400, they are paying a lower rate, accounting payroll taxes, than their secretary or - whomever around their office."
- warren buffet (http://www.azquotes.com/author/2136-warren_buffett/tag/taxes) he's #2 on forbes list you're paying for a three-trillion-dollar war in iraq and syria.
now get back to work so your lifetime's worth of taxes can buy trump another cruise missile.
these types of houses tend to be up in the hills, and that tends to be the first place the fires hit.
furthermore, what's the average acreage of a residential/commercial lot in la.
murdoch's place is 13 acres...so how does that compare on a firefighting level to a more common residential area?
if you divide 475 acres (skirball fire) by the number of homes in the area it does come out to about 36.5. so would that mean each home there is 13 acres also?
if so, thats 39 acres per firetruck.
please don't take my math as perfect, was always my weakest subject.
i'm still uncertain if this is just practical firefighting or favoritism.
they do not average anything close to 13 acres.
i didn't think they did....i wanted to know what the average acreage was.
i figured half to (maybe) 1 acre?
those homes are literally right there by the fires.
so are thousands of others fire fighters/stations are funded by property taxes.
those people better have more than the average fire truck coverage.
so what.
it's simple economics.
those neighborhoods provide more income for the city thru property tax, income taxes, and lack of welfare distribution.
would you let those houses burn and save a ghetto that is a net loss financially to a community?
then you'll have no firefighters left for the next prolonged emergency because there isn't any tax money left.
i heard something on the news today about the fire department strategically picking out neighborhoods in the path of some of the fires to try to fortify and prevent the houses there from catching and spreading the fire further.
makes sense to try to contain what you can, especially in residential areas.
isn't the majority of the area that's burning wilderness?
puerto ricans will now be able to purchase the "restore communications" package for $79.99/month.
naw more like 99.99/month and shitty internet service this ain't no chrsitmas, this is a dismas and unlock a sense of accomplishment.
use the coupon code "boricua" for an extra 5% off your monthly package.
my package already got 5% off right after i was born.
weird , my email had the coupon “quesejodabarcardi” for 15% off now to see how long it takes for that money to actually get there.
approving the funds is great.
contracting the work out, keeping tabs on each of those projects, and auditing the use of the funds is where the hell of bureaucracy takes place.
or who they get to restore the communications.
i am all for some google fiber.
the cost of submarine cables to support such a rollout would exceed $77 million alone.
google fiber is basically dead.
they continue in places where it already exists but there are no plans for extension of service and they've instituted layoffs.
google has no plans to be an isp.
yea it was like, gasp, actually not profitable to install internet throughout the country.
that's why the satellite thing is gaining steam, because physical interstate infastructure simply doesn't work in this country.
i keep seeing this batted around, but they announced and started a rollout in louisville, ky months after those layoffs (unless there was a second round of them i didn't hear about).
that's all new cable in that market.
now, i'd grant that maybe they're slowing down, and/or some kind of major mismanagement happened internally.
or maybe alphabet, inc decided its other pet projects should get some wind in their sails for a bit.
but i don't think fiber is dead just yet.
yep.
look at our money that went to haiti as an example.
not to mention where a majority of the money is spent.
just a pr move to get people to stop bitching about nn do you mean puerto relations, or public rico?
it’s moving the focus to pr for good pr so pr can then spend money on nn which will be really bad pr and for pr.
just enjoy a positive when it happens, good lord.
you mean 2 months ago?
yes, if everyone is somehow ok with people bitching here about something that happened two months ago, they seem to have no qualms about the time it happened.
i think most people don't pay close enough attention to even notice the date lol.
too excited to come and comment their opinion for those upvotes, they miss some important details it is a negative disguised as a positive, though.
how many folks in pr do you think will be able to even afford this if nn is killed off?
not many.
it's a positive made to disguise a negative that will far outweigh it.
afford what?
this is the repair of communications infrastructure.
"folks in pr" aren't paying for it.
you’re delusional.
this article is over 2 months old.
www.status.pr says 77% of the cell sites are up and 85% of the island has cell coverage.
you can lay a lot of fiber for $77m its honestly the perfect time for an upgrade.

something tells me that $77 million dollar contract is going to verizon.
i feel like for $77m, the u.s. government should own the communications infrastructure of puerto rico.
then i realized ajit would be in charge and i changed my mind for wanting it.
can't spy on people that can't communicate this article was written 1,532 hours ago.
why was it just posted today, 4 hours ago?
so now they move theyre grasp to territories that have no legal power.
great.
so we get to spend even more money on infrastructure we don't own.
i'm not saying pr doesn't need it because they do, but which company will end up benefiting from this?
normally this would be /r/upliftingnews however if ajit is behind it its probably a way of using tax dollars for $77 mil infrastructure of profiteering, especially once net neutrality vote is done and those additionally fees and pricing gradually rolls to ease customers into not being outraged.
how else will the fcc take net neutrality if their internet is down??

garbage pilling up in nyc?
what's the news here exactly?
so far as i can gather: "people struggle to learn how to sort recycling."
that the garbage isn't the giants.
new yorker, here.
the city always does these types of projects in a really half-assed sort of way.
the problem is they don't actually want to perfect the process because that would remove a huge swath of tickets that could be written up by sanitation police.
the city thinks they're slick but they work along a process that's similar to planned obsolescence in electronics.
they fully plan for people to fail at upholding the rules so they can add those ticket write-ups into the next budget.
**they don't predict ticket numbers, they set them.
** what the city needs to do is establish a lock-bin system for the schools that works similar to the uk system.
the uk has these bins for garbage pickup that are basically lock-boxes.
you can't get into them and they can only be opened and emptied by sanitation workers.
you need dumpsters created with this same mindset and then you leave it to the city to take care of the rest.
the city won't do it though.
you'll have to drag them kicking and screaming all the way to the bank.
would agree with this assessment, nyc does the same thing with traffic tickets.
and restaurant health inspections haven't heard of that, don't you loose a grade if you fail a,b,c.
this sounds like what they do with street cleaning at odd hours of the day in daly city, ca.
yep.
and now they rolled out the brown-bin organics recycling program.
we started using it as soon as it came out and then saw that sanitation was just emptying it with the regular black-bag trash.
most people on my block have stopped using it because of this, but i insist to my wife that we do because one morning those sanitation priuses are going to go around to collect that sweet, sweet ticket money.
why is a school using bins and not a dumpster?
it's nyc, basically all trash is curbside.
those bins are only for food/organic scraps.
everything else is divided into trash or recycling and goes in bags.
you're trying to tell me nyc doesn't have dumpsters?
fewer than you would expect.
that's crazy.
so what would make this school any different than any other business?
nothing, far as i know every business does curbside trash as well.
i believe the only dumpster pick up services are private.
i've only seen dumpsters used for construction projects.
there's not much room for them in most places.
most new york streets and buildings (outside of larger, full/half-block new developments with loading docks) don't have complementary alleyways to place them.
in a school you'd put it in the parking lot that's not even a lot of trash, by nyc standards.
that's like 1/4 the amount of trash i regularly see at a grade 6-8 school.
how long until the city needs to use it's mob connection's to get a rocket?
good news everyone!
has this poor little baby they interviewed never seen any other school or business in the city?
hell, he's doing the interview right next to the new fancy food scrap bins and their goddamn recycling.
iif he's trying to make the argument that the school's not being green he should try to take a picture when it's not recycling day.
this is a complete non story huh?
you didnt watch the entire video did you?
you really should before commenting.
there were multiple examples(with pictures) of 40-50 trash bags on the curb.
furthermore, the community board(not just the 1 guy being interviewed) has filed a complaint as well.
the mayor's office has already had to remind the school of it's obligation to maintain the same recycling standards as regular citizens.
this implies the school was not doing so.
lastly, the residents are not permitted to leave garbage out on the curb on non-pickup days and the school is violating this policy as well.
they put garbage out daily, regardless of pickup schedules.
it looked like 85% cardboard boxes in all of the photos.
the other identifiable things were food.
so i guess they need to forcefeed the children.
please go to the 0:21 mark of the video.
does that look like cardboard?
the video that says the mayor's office has been contacted, not that they've reminded the school to do anything?
the department of sanitation has said they'll be meeting with the school to ensure that recycling standards are being met, nothing that say the school isn't already doing that.
his pictures still look like recycling going by bag color, and recycling is picked up every day in the area &gt;his pictures still look like recycling going by bag color all of those at the 0:21 mark are regular white trash bags.
please stop making excuses for the school not maintaining sanitation levels required of the community.
again, you attacked the guy being interviewed, but it is the entire community board taking the issue to council, not just him.
&gt;the video that says the mayor's office has been contacted, not that they've reminded the school to do anything apologies, it was the sanitation board that had to do so: &gt;public schools have received extensive assistance and guidance from the department of sanitation on how to comply with the city's recycling law and the school organic program requirements, and it is incumbent upon schools to properly participate in the recycling programs.
in this case, we will set up a meeting with the pertinent school staff to ensure they are properly managing their material.
a meeting would not be scheduled if they weren't violating standards.
again, we are talking about a school of 3 grades.
if they are in fact producing as much garbage as the residents are indicating, that is a problem.
so how is the amount of trash produced by the school related to the "green"?
of course, it isn't.
but that's why this article was written and that's why it has these upvotes, so that ignorant people can say "see, i always knew that green stuff was just a bunch of bullshit."
&gt; so how is the amount of trash produced by the school related to the "green"?
if you ask basically anyone who's not an armchair reddit pedant whether a "green school" should produce a lot of trash or not much trash, they'll say the latter.
yes it is formally related to energy usage, however it's a bit silly that they focused on that instead of multifactorial waste reduction.
i'm not saying there isn't a problem with the amount of trash this school is producing.
i have no idea.
and i sympathise with the residents that don't want big piles of garbage on their street.
but this publication turned a local story about a public building mishandling their trash disposal into an ideological attack on environmentalism at large.
yep, and the fact that the school is on staten island means it's surrounded by people who would go out of their way to spite anything seen as liberal - it's the only nyc borough that voted for trump after all.
the video shows 2 bins and a few bags of garbage for an entire school while one of the guys complaining tries to say the school should be producing only a quarter of that - what is that based on?
the smallest amount of critical thinking would require asking if the school produces more trash than the average nyc school of its size, or finding out if the green label has to do with the utilities used by the school, rather than how it treats its trash.
the school was opened 2 years ago and i'm sure there were plenty of nimbys complaining back then.
the guys in the video are probably the only ones left keeping that fight alive, and the garbage is the only focus for them to complain about.
totally agree with this but why do they have bins and not dumpsters?
a dumpster would solve this problem immediately.
totally agree too.
my problem with this reporting is that they tried to create a nonsensical element of hypocrisy while exaggerating the amount of trash when the reality is there's a raccoon problem and the neighbors don't like looking at the garbage, so they want the school to put it in a dumpster and put the dumpster in a place that isn't visible.
i dunno, the mayor's office already has had to remind the school that it is responsible to maintain the same recycling standards as residents.
this implies they weren't.
furthermore, the complaints are that the trash piles up all week when the code specifically says it should only be put out on pickup days.
that is a legit complaint as it does lead to sanitation problems.
no, stuff run by diblasio, and the nyc schools is a bunch of bullshit.
i don't even like de blasio, but new york school performance has been shit for far longer than he's been around and is irrelevant to the conversation here.
reducing waste is a good goal; it lowers costs borne by the city related to energy, maintenance, sanitation and transportation.
the article says that the school is designed to produce the energy that it needs, this has nothing to do with how much garbage it produces.
nuance is deader than disco in america, sadly.
if someone started a political party based solely on an appreciation of nuance, i'd be all in.
i mean thats some trash, but is that really how bad it gets?
because if so this may be overblown, that doesn't seem like an absurd amount of trash for a school.
guess it's time for the trash barges in today's gotcha politics... is anyone here surprised by this?
and the school doesn't have a designated dumpster area because.....?
i commute to nyc and i think i might move south soon.
you spend 2 hour's a day commuting, no employer ever cover's the cost, and metro north can never get you in on time.
i'v about had it with nyc.
why dont they have a couple of dumpsters par for the course.
so called "green" is often not hey there captain platitude, how about you provide some concrete evidence or even meaningful arguments instead of just smearing shit and walking away?
smear shit and walk away... that's what my neighbors do.
the school being "green" is not the reason the trash is piling up.
did you even read the article?
nowhere does it say that.
it says the school is "designed to be easy on the environment by producing the energy it uses."
wtf does that have to do with trash collection?
you can't just see the words "green" and "trash" and shoehorn those ideas together without even thinking.
who said it was garbage from being green?
you did.
although i would love to hear the mental gymnastics as to what you "really" meant.
no, i said that sometime so called "green" really isn't.
not sure if english is your first language but most people understand the term really.
so you just felt everyone needed to hear that and it has nothing to do with the op, got it.
did you forget your meds or are you just a bit off all the time?
give the other members of the troll farm my regards.
i've heard that line before, every time an idiot can't defend their points.
like clockwork, really.
i do not doubt for a second that you have heard that line before.
you can try to pretend that's not what you were saying but it's pretty transparent.
what did you mean if not that?
lol, you are thinking too much.
could i possibly be saying that large quantities of trash isn't that green?
there are so many ways to be "green" though.
i don't see how producing trash makes them not green.
they're green because, as the article said, the school is designed to be easy on the environment by producing the energy it uses.
trash is unavoidable.
not everything can be recycled.
this article could have just left out the word "green" because in this case it's totally irrelevant.
clearly there's a problem here.
the trash isn't getting picked up.
is that the school's fault?
who knows.
it doesn't even address that in the article.
doesn't mean the school isn't green.
typically, green initiatives reduce the trash rather than create more quantity.
most of the stuff in the clear bags is marked for recycling.
everything is wrapped in packaging.
food, janitorial supplies, school supplies.
there is always going to be waste but ny is pretty good with recycling.
used to be you threw everything on one bag and it got shipped out to a landfill.
i totally agree, but those are not the schools touting they are totally green and they seem like they are much greener nope.
thats not the typical meaning of green.
like i said, it could mean many things.
in this case it means creating a smaller carbon footprint by self-producing the energy you consume.
electricity in the us is still produced by burning coal more than by any other method.
coal is harmful.
your original statement is just incorrect.
that's ok. it happens.
yes, sometimes "green" is bullshit.
sometimes companies/organizations market a green image when they're actually not.
it's called "green washing."
it happens but it's certainly not "par for the course" yet, i'll maintain this "green school " isn't being very green creating much trash.
how much trash is typical of a ny school?
does this one produce more trash?
less?
an average amount?
do you actually know enough to be able to say?
i just don't see why you're pushing this so much.
this article is a waste of space.
i feel like you were pulled in by the clickbait title and fell for it.
[deleted] i think this article counts as a pretty good example... did you read it?
the trash problem has nothing to do with the fact that the school is "green."
in fact, they don't even mention why the trash is piled up.
ok. the green school in the op apparently isnt all that green in creating all that garbage.
should they produce zero waste?
what is an acceptable level?
that row of bags is about half of what my tiny school produced.
green=/=zero waste did i say zero waste somewhere?
i trade cryptocurrency and bitcoin is going bonkers right now.
it's only skyrocketing because cme futures are launching in 11 days and this created a short-squeeze where: * people on the sidelines got major fear-of-missing-out disease (fomo) * short-sellers got squeezed and then squeezed again when 12,500, 15,000, and 17,500 got broken through this will fall back down to more reasonable levels soon enough and i'd say it will lose half its value in the next week or so but still close the year above $10k.
&gt; this will fall back down to more reasonable levels soon enough they said this at $500.
then they said it at $2500.
but no keep saying it i'm sure it will be true eventually.
&gt; they said this at $500 note what i said and didn't say.
i said it would fall back down to more reasonable levels.
i didn't say it was going to collapse and stay there.
bitcoin has had plenty of corrections, even this year with 40% corrections.
you can't go from $10k to $20k at multi-billion dollar levels - and stay there without ever correcting even if temporarily.
assets do not continue going hyperbolic without falling back prior to their next climb.
depends, actually.
it's not the steepest climb we've seen without a correction, and with enormous new interest, it's not a big stretch to say it's just the expanding userbase.
&gt; assets do not continue going hyperbolic without falling back prior to their next climb.
there has never been an asset like bitcoin before though.
its unprecedented territory.
and they were right, it crashes and then months later recovers.
bitcoin has gone a very long time since it's last sustained crash... but if you follow past trends it's due for a correction.
it will crash to 12k though it could be as low as 9k.
that being said, against following past trends, it will back back where it is now in 2-3 months.
basically, bitcoin tends to crash where the bottom is around, or slightly bellow, the last peak.
and they were correct.
bitcoin has already gone through 2 crashes.
&gt; at this point, bitcoin seems to be caught up in the self-perpetuating hype cycle of a bubble.
this has happened to bitcoin twice before.
in mid-2011, bitcoin's price rose from $1 to $30 in two months, before crashing back to $2 before the end of the year.
then in early 2013, bitcoin's price rose from $13 to more than $250 in four months—before losing 80 percent of its value over the course of 48 hours.
https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/bitcoin-surges-to-15000-a-25-percent-rise-in-48-hours/ his prediction of when and at what price it will come back to earth is worth less than the ink it's printed with.
however, it is a bubble and it will crash at some point.
a lot of people are going to lose a lot of money.
of course, a lot of other people will make a lot of money at the same time.
it's a big ol' bubble.
i don't understand how cryptocurrencies gain their value.
can someone post a brief explanation?
people think they will be worth more tomorrow than today, and it becomes increasingly more difficult to make new ones, so there is a effectively a finite source.
&gt; it becomes increasingly more difficult to make new ones, so there is a effectively a finite source.
like a gold standard or tulip bulbs, then?
if there is a finite source, then doesn't that prevent an expanding economy?
at some point, if day to day purchases were to become increasingly cumbersome, doesn't that ensure it's collapse?
yes, and eventually, i dont see a reason why bitcoin cant be a stable currency/investment.
however right now, no one (or not many) have an idea when it will get to the point where it costs much more to make a bitcoin than it is actually worth.
everyone is going crazy with a financial instrument they dont understand, and there is a lot of factors that may be artificially driving up the cost, and those factors are not accurately quantifiable.
&gt; a reason why bitcoin cant be a stable currency it costs $4 for a transaction to go through reasonably fast.
they can supposedly increase the number of transactions per block, but it'll require bitcoin to split again, and who knows how that'll go.
even with that though, it's still not necessarily "cheap" for transactions in an overall sense.
compare to merchant fees for credit cards, which are in the 20-40 cent range, or cash which is essentially free unless someone pays in pennies.
anyway, you don't want high fixed friction costs on everyday purchases when you're creating a currency, because who the heck wants to buy a $5 footlong for $9?
(in b4 /r/hailcorporate) don't credit cards also charge 1.5% of the transaction amount?
2.5% at minimum and some (amex) are 4%+.
depends on your credit card processor.
1-1.5% is common for safe businesses (low chance of chargebacks, low risk) also fuck amex.
well, it wont be used by ordinary people for day to day purchases, but $4 transaction is not a problem if you are dealing with international trade worth billions.
&gt;well, it wont be used by ordinary people for day to day purchases then it's not a currency in any real sense.
&gt;but $4 transaction is not a problem if you are dealing with international trade worth billions.
no, but volatility (in any direction) *is* a major problem for that.
also international money laundering regulations are a thing, so it'd raise the question of why someone needs to use bitcoin to transfer billions (or even millions) for legitimate business.
thats why i mostly refer to it as an investment, right now it is a terrible currency for several reasons.
im saying it could be viable if it stabilizes.
then it makes perfect sense for international trade because it cannot be manipulated by a government.
who the fuc are you or the government to tell me what to do with my money and how i should transfer it?
take your illegitimate bulshit and shove it.
or if you are doing something sketchy and want to hide the transaction.
or are doing something non sketchy like buying a car.
what is the advantage of using bitcoin to buy a car over regular money?
&gt; everyone is going crazy with a financial instrument they dont understand, smacks of 2008 this is why i'm selectively mining lesser known cryptos with stronger tech than bitcoin - these will be the ones that emerge from the tulipmania we're seeing.
not a bad idea but you'll need to be patient.
name some names.
any recommendations?
which ones are you looking at?
i agree that bitcoin might not be the dominant crypto in 2050. most of business history supports that thought.
monroe is around 300, monroe is gaining traction because it is a untraceable currency, unlike bitcoin.
darknetmarkets are slowly going to start using it more and more as the feds crack down on them.
do you mean monero?
&gt; everyone is going crazy with a financial instrument they dont understand this is an incorrect statement.
*some* are going crazy.
*some* don't understand.
many are not crazy.
many understand completely.
this is not a new thang.
this crypto-craze is animal spirits personified.
how are the costs of making bitcoin accrued?
at some point people would have to abandon government issued currency, trading it for bitcoin with no plan to return.
isn't that a bit presumptuous?
or am i not understanding?
im saying eventually it will be a much more stable, and understood investment, and its value will be more accurate.
it wont replace government currencies, but i would think it will fill a similar role as gold, or it could be used for international trading.
&gt; like a gold standard or tulip bulbs, then?
you think tulip bulbs are a finite resource?
&gt; if there is a finite source, then doesn't that prevent an expanding economy?
at some point, if day to day purchases were to become increasingly cumbersome, doesn't that ensure it's collapse?
bitcoins are divisible by 8 decimal places.
it's almost like a gold standard, if someone threw the old gold bars into a black hole and everyone else traded a more microscopic amount everyday.
not like tulip bulbs.
the tulip mania/bubble is a poor analogy for cryptocurrency.
how do i get a bitcoin?
i've been told that i can get them for free with my top of the line gpu, but this makes no sense to me edit: really?
who the fuck downvotes an honest question?
ignore the fools.
you can profitably mine altcoins with a gpu.
go to whattomine.com.
figure out what's most profitable for your high end gpu.
figure out how to mine it.
sell it for bitcoin every week or two.
you only have to pay for electricity.
enjoy.
it costs a lot of money for the electricity to create one.
i am more unsure on this part, but i think it is already getting close to be more expensive to mine a bitcoin than it is worth (perhaps its worth is directly tied to how much it costs to make), and that a lot of the bitcoin farms are essentially subsidized by the government in china with cheap electricity.
what does it mean to 'mine' one?
literally calculating out the block chain.
the currency in itself is a math problem that keeps getting harder.
this is a simplified take, and i dont know a ton about it.
hmm.
maybe they can just change the problem that has to be solved.
they kindve do, i think it is artificially controlled how difficult it is to control inflation.
think of it as looking for a needle in a haystack.
the more people looking, the bigger the stack and smaller the needle gets.
if people stopped mining, the haystack would get smaller and the needle bigger.
it's meant to keep the flow of new bitcoins to ~6/hour.
it was like that, but currently with a top of the line machine that goes for $1,500 list price you can make around $25 for every $5 you spend on electricity per day at normal us electricity rates.
however, it's difficult to get your hands on asic miners these days since the profits are so high.
they get harder to mine though as more people do it though, so it will likely not remain this profitable forever.
youtube "bitcoin under the hood" ... on phone rn and too lazy to link you can buy it from an exchange like coinbase by linking your checking account or using your debit card.
to mine them though, you need specialized mining equipment.
the current asic machines run at around 13 th/s, which is far higher than any gpu has.
however, you can still mine other lesser known coins with gpus.
people invest in them because they can't be devalued when your government prints money and can't be seized whenever your bank feels like it.
isn't it infinitely divisible?
or not?
can someone also eli5 on how you get cryptocurrency and how can you sell it.
think of like buying stocks.
you need to create an account at an exchange like www.coinbase.com, fund it, and then you can buy and sell it like stock.
i recommend using www.gdax.com - a coinbase company - you can buy/sell w/o any fees for limit orders.
i trade crypto so let me know if you have any questions.
also, the last few posts i wrote might be helpful.
somebody told me i can use my top of the line gpu to essentially get bitcoins for free.
is this true?
ignore the other guy.
in fact, ignore 95% of the people in this thread.
they have no idea what they are talking about.
you can very profitably mine with a top end gpu by mining altcoins.
use whattomine.com for ideas on what is most profitable currently.
sell altcoins for bitcoin.
profit.
thanks for the info, i'll have to look into it.
if i'm not mistaken, this seems like a pretty easy way to make free money you gotta pay for the electricity, but if you already own a nice gpu the returns are really nice... do your research and make sure you're practicing good security, and enjoy the gains.
thanks.
so i'm naturally limited by the power supply unit in my system, so unless i need to hook my gpu up to an external setup, i don't really forsee power being that big of an issue (i live in a small apartment btw) this was true a few years ago now everyone is getting asic's now a days (i.e.
specialized mining hardware).
it's not profitable anymore for a regular person unless you want to spend $50k+ on a small farm.
think of it this way: if you could spend $2k on a set of high-end gpu's and mine one btc per day that's worth $15k+ then why wouldn't everyone do it?
how long has it been worth 15k?
wasn't it only worth 700k 11 months ago?
its at $17k right now.
it is not normal nor safe for something to increase in price so drastically over such a short period of time.
depending on how tolerant you are of risk you could try jumping in, but it could also collapse at any time.
the peak could be next week, tomorrow, next month, or 5 minutes from now.
&gt; then why wouldn't everyone do it because most people don't understand what the hell you just said.
it's essentially "if being a doctor pays so much, why isn't everyone a doctor?"
because not all people are smart enough to figure things out.
[here is a short explanation](http://www.clickhole.com/video/dont-understand-bitcoin-man-will-mumble-explanatio-2537) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greater_fool_theory it's a commodity just like pork bellies or wheat.
it goes up when people want it and down when they don't.
i am in crypto, some of it has a lot of interesting use cases such as full anonymous transaction (monero, nav etc.).
bitcoin is famous because it is the first and thus the biggest.
it is a really big bubble right now and nobody in crypto really likes bitcoin anyways.
for me to send $100, it would cost me like $8.
they are a product that cannot be mass produced.
instead, they are slowly produced.
unlike fiat currency which countries like the us can print in any denomination and even just write down $800,000,000,000 in a ledger (no printing needed).
as such, they are seen as a viable alternative to fiat currency.
the market cap is seen by some as being equal to the global currency market.
that's a lot.
literally all the money in the world.
only so many coins in the world.
the more you have now, the more they’ll be worth in the future.
some are betting on crypto toppling fiat, some are trying to ride a speculative bubble and get rich quick.
supppy and demand.
same as every market like any other pyramid scheme, hype and promises of making a fortune.
going to be fun when it pops.
it's actually going to be terrible for a lot of people when it pops.
"it" being the dollar.
remindme!
six months bigger bubble is in bonds, stocks, and commercial real estate wait, bonds?
how are bonds a bubble?
this feels so incredibly bubbly.
i know a guy who claims he is a bitcoin millionaire though so part of me feels like i'm a damn fool for continuing to invest in traditional mutual funds.
you're only a damn fool if you think there's something wrong with what you're doing.
mutual funds are safe bets with modest expected gains and that's not going to change.
crytop is not.
crypto will be big.
but picking who those winners and losers will be?
good luck.
it's the .com bubble.
big things will emerge out of it, but a lot of stuff is going to sink when it jumps into the waters and doesn't figure out how to remain afloat.
bitcoin is positioned strongly, but it's not necessarily going to be the ultimate winner if it doesn't figure out it's scaling situation soon enough.
the bitcoin millionaire friend of mine is fond of mocking me for my mutual funds.
he cashed all his retirement out of the stock market (paying penalties) in order to invest in bitcoin and other cryptos.
runs a couple of mining rigs and the whole nine yards.
the salient point that i'd make to him is that until he actually cashes out, he has not realized any income.
if he wants to gamble, great.
but not only has he not left the casino, his money is still on the table!
remindme!
six months meh.
not as stable though.
i mean, one of those had a hand in almost collapsing the entire economy; so there is that.
sure, but anyone would bet on jpmorgan than bitcoin surviving.
yeah.
cause the taxpayers are required to bail those fuckers out.
not only that, but jpmorgan has many many many years of financial experience.
they've survived a lot of global economic turmoil, unlike bitcoin.
certainly investors trust jpmorgan more.
millenials may have other dreams though.
lol "i trust an organization fined multiple times a year for financial fraud more than math" -investors, apparently.
right after jamie called bitcoin a fraud, jp morgan got in trouble for fraud.... are we on a first name basis with jamie here?
does it matter?
no, i just thought it was a bit funny math works for jpmorgan too, ya know?
they've been dealing with math for many many many years.
:p yeah, but bitcoin hasn't needed a government bailout for its predatory business practices backfiring :p right... and yet jpmorgan is a company investors will value well over bitcoin, seeing as how the former has many years of experience, surviving countless economic meltdowns, including global catastrophes.
but, hey, millenials like to dream of bitcoin, therefore bitcoin is better to invest in.
lol &gt; but, hey, millenials like to dream of bitcoin i mean, i personally know a bitcoin millionaire, so... not really a dream.
not really.
jpmorgan works on human behavior and greed.
it's why it needed to get bailed out.
bitcoin is pure math, nothing more and nothing less.
speculation around bitcoin is another matter.
you realize you're comparing a company to a currency, in the context of which one has human behavior?
:p but hey, any one who can be convinced by that sort of argument deserves to invest in bitcoin.
i think we can both agree on that, right?
well you made that comparison first with your previous comment.
yes, but their math is concerned with how to make themselves money, where as bitcoins math is focused on ensuring valid transactions.
and your point is?
i honestly don't know since i didn't really get what you were implying with the jp morgan using math thing, but i think my overall point is that bitcoin is a system based on hard math with no self interest, where as jp morgan has shown time and time again they will abuse their customers trust if it means they make more money i don't think bitcoin is going anywhere.
the stories of success have alot of people beleiving in it.
they give it value because they want it to have value.
as long a people beleive in it, it will work.
the only reason the money in your pocket has any value is because enough poeple beleive it does.
value is not inherent, but given.
which means that more people believe in investing in jpmorgan than bitcoin.
can you back that idea up?
yes, that could change by the minute though.
bitcoin is a bubble.
most of the investors are fools who don't have any clue what it really is.
there are several other cryptocurrencies based on better technology.
in a year or two bitcoin will be worth a few hundred at most.
can't wait for all the morons who invested their life savings in it to lose everything.
remindme!
two years &gt; bitcoin is a bubble.
most of the investors are fools who don't have any clue what it really is.
there are several other cryptocurrencies based on better technology.
in a year or two bitcoin will be worth a few hundred at most.
can't wait for all the morons who invested their life savings in it to lose everything.
remindme!
two years since i'm sure if it does crash you will just ignore yours.
remindme!
six months because i'm not waiting two years, jesus you guys are petty damn you and your proactive ways!
eh, it's a gamble.
on some level, i guess all gamblers are morons.
but i made $80k in six months being a moron so what do i know.
i hope you actually cashed out said $80k, otherwise they are just theoretical proceeds.
and don't forget about taxes!
i've done a fair bit of crypto work this year but decided to at least recoup my investment with a tidy profit and keep the rest in the market as a gamble.
if i lose it, fine, if it goes up, that's just gravy.
if you're so smart and confident then why don't you short it?
"the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent."
not only that, you generally have to put up a margin to short.
if the price goes too high, there's a margin call, and you lose your shirt.
btc's price is going up exponentially.
even if you're 100% confident that btc will be worth $0 in six months, there's nothing keeping it from hitting $80k before that, and you're completely fucked if that happens.
even if he's right it takes a few years for a bubble to collapse.
nobody will know until then.
itt: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5z2_fggzli i'm just patiently waiting for when cryptocurrency tries to imitate ea's stock price.
basically its the current fad for money laundering and undetectable transfers.
yes, the currency where every single transaction is broadcast to everyone in the world is used for undetectable transfers.
you're correct in that anyone can detect that a transaction happened.
however, what the guy was probably trying to say was that the transaction are anonymous, which they pretty much are unless you seriously have a target on your back or you make your bitcoin address known.
the real difference from a bank account is that you don't need id to make a bitcoin wallet, while a bank will make you show two forms of id in person to open an account.
exchanges though do require id to cash out in the us anyway, so no one is pulling out cash anonymously in the us from exchanges.
of course that number does not include assorted brands of us taxpayer-funded ~~sellswords~~ private security personnel.
taxpayer funded private security?
that's interesting; hadn't heard of that.
got a source?
really?
the dod has long been hiring private security to guard base perimeters and entrances, etc overseas.
this isn't remotely new.
google the company blackwater or xe.
they're called academi now.
i'm aware of blackwater but was hoping for a reputable source on their receiving taxpayer funds currently.
private companies that work for the government get paid by the government.
that means taxes.
unless the government started having bake sales or selling pepperoni sticks door to door.
😂😂😂 "hello, sir or madam, would you be interested in buying any baked goods to help the good ol' usofa in pushing back against the terror group that is isis?
buy now and lemon cookies are buy 1 get 1 free!
just remember to mail in your blackwater bonus $2.00 refund!"
no shit i had a gas station attendant ask if i wanted to donate a dollar to the military... i declined.
then when i was driving off it hit me like, "the fuck did she just ask me?"
i am military we dont take donations.
lol...the f?
i'm hoping that was for some kind of veterans fund and she was just confused or something.
just phrased it weird?
lol...i hope... yeah it was po dunk.
could have easily been a scam as it was her just being mistaken.
the libertarian method.
this would work well in some states.
yeah, true..i think i'm probably just overthinking it.
so where else would the money come from?
wasnt that the point of bonds and "government cheese"to pay for things while technically not using taxes.
https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/08/iraq-afghanistan-contractor-pentagon-obama/495731/ really?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_united_states_defense_contractors look at number 1 under "a" gotta pay the contractors somehow :p they've been in constant use since forever.
you might remember how fallujah was sparked because of blackwater playing rambo (always gotta love how the civilian side of things always ends up bloodthirstier than the military side).
in theory, and under various regulations, these organizations are only supposed to operate as security.
we're not supposed to use them as a fighting force, but can hire armed companies to protect things.
and since they aren't paying themselves for the privilege, that means fat government contracts.
it's really good money.
you go to work and get paid every day.
turns out, some people's personal skillsets are more exciting than yours.
should they not be able to make money off them if there is demand in the market?
it's not like the us is using these contractors to overthrow african governments.
they're just bodyguards for diplomats and other state department facilities.
why is the government paying high dollar for ex-military private contractors for security when it get current military personnel for far less?
create a specialized detail in the army, extent the purview of the secret secretive, or whatever needs to be done but handle it in house.
because the law limits the number of soldiers you are allowed to have.
you can spend 1% of your budget and cover 5% of your low skill jobs, letting you use the real soldiers for jobs that actually matter.
out of curiosity, which law are you referring to?
is there some kind of budget cap that makes this impossible or is there an actual prohibition on the amount of soldiers the army can have at once?
because it is actually cheaper long term.
[deleted] cost-efficient solutions for private parties, maybe.
there's a reason that the us maintains an army, which is an enormous sunk cost.
and let's not even get started on the moral issues surrounding the use of private mercenaries, who can never be held to the same standards as actual us military personnel.
yep, your last point is precisely why they have to be prohibited.
they are going to be wielded to support us strategic interests when that involves illegal military operations the government can't be overtly associated with.
if we read in the financial press that academi is buying a robotics company, i'm just going to save time and go ask hideo kojima what happens over the next 20 years.
**“i will never send our finest into battle unless necessary, and i mean absolutely necessary, and will only do so if we have a plan for victory with a capital v,” he thundered.
“the world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies.”** --donald trump, april 27, 2016 "the numbers of american service members in syria rose after a decision by president trump in march to allow subordinate military commanders set the levels of troops they needed."
-from the actual article.
the pentagon also claims the troop numbers are trending down, but the history of lying makes that hard to trust.
regardless, leaving the war to the people responsible for the actual fighting seems like a good step, not a bad one.
yup newsflash all presidents are non-interventionists as candidates and complete hawks when in office.
see obama for the most egregious example.
only true non-interventionist whose ran in the last 30 years was ron paul but america fucked that up hard yeah as much as i hate trump, i also dislike that obama gets whitewashed.
especially for his foreign interventions.
obama deserves criticism for ramping the drone program up 1000% and associated missile strikes, but he never put us combat troops into a warzone like syria, either.
&gt; he never put us combat troops into a warzone like syria, either.
that's not true.
he increased troops in existing warzones and also put special forces into multiple new warzones (much like the current syria situation).
have people already forgotten about the libyan intervention?
special forces in advisory/teaching role aren't **combat** troops.
he moved troops from iraq to afghanistan, which he ran on in his campaign .
they are still combat troops, they are there to provide combat assistance where needed, and undoubtedly engaged in combat operations.
the same situation is true in syria, the official line from the government is that they are there to support anti-isis groups.
here's an article about the troops in libya: https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2017/03/24/the-pentagon-wants-to-keep-ground-troops-in-libya-and-go-on-offense-in-somalia/ if you can't tell the difference between a dozen special forces troops and tens of thousands of troops, i don't know what else to say.
are they literally boots on the ground?
yes.
are they sometimes forced to defend themselves in combat when going out with their students?
yes.
is it their primary order to seek out combat and capture territory?
no.
are they an occupying force?
no.
you're making a disingenuous false equivalency.
oh sorry, i didn't realize combat troop classification was based on numbers.
and "tens of thousands" of us soldiers in syria?
what world do you live in?
gotta give you some credit for using some bigger words there though!
congratulations on focusing on just the numbers, and completely ignoring all of the other pertinent categorizations.
yeah obama was pretty shit about that.
it's the one thing in his administration that i cannot forgive.
the military campaigns and drone strikes are such near-sighted crap that are only generating more problems for us in the future, all so military contractors can make the big bucks farming out bombs to the good ole' usa.
obama was the most egregious?
not the guy who started 2 wars with hundreds of thousands of troops but the guy who drew down and used mostly drones?
well i guess i'm not surprised the ron paul fan is a little delusional.
i think he means egregious in the sense that obama acted like a dove and ended up being a hawk, where as with bush we pretty much all knew to expect hawkish behavior from day one.
bush did far worse, but obama was more hypocritical.
the guy who drew down, catapulting the region into another civil war.
so you're going to have to be consistent.
should we be interventionist or not.
geopolitics are a little bit more complicated than “interventionist or not” i agree!!!
but if you're going to claim obama was egregious in his retreat from non-interventionism by intervening too much, then you're going to have to fucking decide if you want intervention or non-interventionism.
you can't criticize a president for going back on his word about being non-interventionism and also criticize him for not intervening enough.
or you can be like me and understand that non-interventionism is a fucking myth and that as the only superpower on the planet the us must be involved and that we must do it intelligently.
but you haven't done that.
you've gone the idiot route.
the president can’t be a non interventionist because the country isn’t.
even if paul had won, he’d be responsible for a whole bunch of interests that need intervention.
president ron paul would have been handed his first security briefing, and it would say isis is a threat to the usa and our allies.
he would be forced to either keep going, or go against 200 years of policy, and all his advisers.
and if an attack happened on his watch (which it would) he’d be roasted.
he also vowed to defeat isis, which in my unprofessional opinion, probably requires some number of boots on the ground.
remind me again, who was it that sold tow missles to these syrians and started this whole debacle?
&gt; and started this whole debacle?
bashar al-assad.
or you might pin it on the guy who set himself on fire in tunisia.
that's funny, i didn't realize hughes was making bgm-71 tows in syria.
they must have opened a new factory.
no, those came from the saudis store that came from the us.
i know you're pushing this back to obama.
that was absolutely a mistake on his and the pentagon's behalf.
i'm not sure what you want me to do about it though.
he's not the president anymore.
trump is and as they say in that biz "the buck stops here".
do you want me to let trump slide on these things because obama did?
how do you feel about trump's handling of the recent problems in africom concerning our sof troops being ambushed, executed, and their bodies desecrated?
or the seals killing a green beret?
or the massacre of a somali village?
&gt;how do you feel about trump's handling of the recent problems in africom concerning our sof troops being ambushed, executed, and their bodies desecrated?
or the seals killing a green beret?
or the massacre of a somali village?
obama, obama, and obama.
or obama.
or obama.
it's the universal answer to all things trump.
trump vowed not to send troops anywhere it wasn't necessary.
unfortunately, because obama pissed in the sandbox and didn't clean up after himself, it has become nessecary for the current administration to correct his mistakes, which is going to require more assets on the ground.
this would have been the case regardless of who won the election.
as convenient as it would be to just pull the plug all at once we've already seen how effective that is.
obama got us involved, and now we are stuck there, and now more us boys are going to have to die because of that mistake.
i don't want to see a single drop of american blood spilled for syria, libya, any of these countries.
as far as i'm concerned they could have asked their sacred allah for help and seen how effective that would be.
but now that we're involved, we've got no choice but to continue.
how do you feel about george w. bush and his middle east actions?
just as bad if not quite a bit worse.
did you prevent you from voting republican?
for me, the gop will have bush hanging around their necks for a very long time to come.
the bush family to me is like the clinton family to you.
i was like 11 in 2004, so no, i didn't vote for gwb.
and i'm no fan of the republican party either.
part of the reason i liked trump during the campaign was it was obvious the gop hated him, did everything they could to stop him and try to nominate that bumbling idiot ted cruz.
but they miscalculated huge, and had to grit their teeth and endorse trump.
trump was running on the republican platform in name only, in reality the gop establishment would have preferred to endorse anybody else.
he said "our finest".
how many of our on-the-ground military personnel are wealthy elites?
:p he made his two oldest sons into their own division.
donnie jr is the signal corps battalion while eric is the military intelligence unit.
trump keeps them way, way, way back behind the lines.
well if he sends the bottom of the barrel solders is that still our finest, or is that a valid technicality....obvious /s seems we have been dominating isis since he became president.
then you didn't see the trend that was happening when obama was still president.
you sound like the morons who say trump skyrocketed the stock market, as if it was 0 under obama and not already growing.
we were winning.
trumps policies rapidly accelerated such, saving countless lives.
&gt;trumps policies rapidly accelerated such, saving countless lives.
absolutely nothing points to that.
all the signs pointed to isis on its deathbed long before trump ever set foot in the oval office.
well the accelerated rate of coalition victories after policy changes does point to that.
at the very least, trump's policies didn't allow a rapid isis expansion in the first place.
thanks obama.
i see you trumpettes are still blaming obama for all of bush's failings.
the economy tanked under bush and obama got blamed for that.
the wars that led to isis were started under bush and obama gets blamed for that too!
you guys are hilarious in your stupidity.
no wait, i mean frightening.
it's frightening that i have to share a country with so many inbred redneck morons.
also you could totally count the lives saved or not by the policies.
we have pretty advanced math that can estimate populations, collateral damages, relative costs of actions, etc.
i don't really understand evaluating a president by their campaign promises.
it's like evaluating your life success by what your goals were when you were 10 years old.
the world looks different from the desk in the oval office.
we should judge a policy by whether it's good policy, not by whether it fulfills campaign promises.
the fact is that the military's work in syria has been great in 2017. isis is falling apart and we're gaining the sort of diplomatic leverage that could bring an ending to the syrian civil war providing that we're willing to accept a less than ideal solution (no democracy).
&gt; it's like evaluating your life success by what your goals were when you were 10 years old while absolutely true the world looks different from the desk in the oval office, this is a false analogy.
"it's like evaluating your successes by what goals you set for yourself a year ago" ftfy to be fair gaining the office of the president you learn the real story about a lot of things.
there are things only select people in power know that has to change your perspective when you learn them.
that is to say, i doubt we know the whole truth about anything going on anywhere in the world and i'm assuming people in the cia, government and white house are more privy to information than we are.
do you think candidate donald trump had spent serious time thinking about syrian policy?
do you think he even had the right information to think about syrian policy?
it would be stupid for trump to hold himself to a promise he made when he was ignorant of the situation.
i was talking about your false analogy, but i included this whole bit... &gt;while absolutely true the world looks different from the desk in the oval office... so i don't know why you are complaining.
but... yes, while he wouldn't have all the information of a president, i would absolutely expect a candidate to think a lot on what was a huge topic, syrian policy.
i wouldn't hold a normal candidate to their campaign promises if it seemed that their new policy worked.
i especially would not hold trump to it because you and i know trump was not a typical candidate.
we should just get out of there.
no win in that place.
save our soldier's lives.
i look forward to the day when renewable energy takes over and the us and the world can just walk away from the whole middle-east region of everlasting sectarian violence.
these aren't typical front line soldiers they are mostly special forces advising the locals in how to fight.
we aren't actually doing the fighting.
you know, just like vietnam in '61.
lol.
people actually believe this baloney?
we're not doing it for oil anymore.
it's almost exclusively for global influence now.
it sounds like you’re saying the syrian conflict is tailored specifically towards oil if there wasn't any oil over there it would probably go back to the way it was before the industrial revolution.
if americans are in the middle east for any reason, the only two thoughts in the public's head are: "oh, they want oil" or "lmao america loves killing brown people".
** cough ** military industrial complex ** cough ** which is a very real thing, but, there's a lot more to american military action than bathing in oil and brown blood.
economic incentives for it, ofc, but reducto ad oleum is lazy and gives us an easy punchline that can obfuscate what is actually going on.
are you being sarcastic?
this war is completely about an oil pipeline.
no and that would be the stupidest way to get one built.
instead of bribing a dictator or just rerouting it to a place you can do so you're going to start a war, make it last for a decade, and then somehow end it in a way that ensures you'll have to pay billions to constantly secure it from attacks.
sorry in advance to the mentally handicapped but that would be retarded.
you'd make more money just building one to the red sea and shipping through the suez or through jordan and isreal or just doing nothing than any potential profit from a line through syria.
if you brought this up in an illuminati meeting they would laugh you out of the big oak paneled board room.
&gt; no and that would be the stupidest way to get one built.
instead of bribing a dictator or just rerouting it to a place you can do so you're going to start a war, make it last for a decade, and then somehow end it in a way that ensures you'll have to pay billions to constantly secure it from attacks.
tell that to every empire and country in human history who went to war every single time.
&gt;you'd make more money just building one to the red sea and shipping through the suez or through jordan and isreal or just doing nothing than any potential profit from a line through syria.
ignoring your childish and petty insults, this is not true.
you'd have to pay egypt and jordan, and shipping is not as efficient for getting oil into landlocked regions, like central europe, who's economy is exploding right now.
but please, insult me more instead of providing actual arguments that make sense.
great post.
it's sad that people have such a one-track mind when it comes to politics.
[deleted] isis was intentionally allowed to fester.
the iraqi army was ordered to retreat when isis marched on mosul, even though they had every ability to shut them down.
i personally believe this was an inside job.
isis was used to give the us an excuse to get involved in syria.
the fact that isis invaded syria from turkey (a us ally), was armed and compsoed mostly of saudis (another us ally), and that the us attempted to dull assad's ability to fight isis, shows that this isn't just about isis.
it was about controlling oil, with a secondary purpose of agitating more conflict to sell more guns.
&gt;i understand oil has a major role in the us operations over there but this conflict in syria does not revolve itself around oil.
then why hasn't the us left syria?
why didn't the us aid assad against isis, instead of imposing a no fly zone for assad, the same way they did to libya?
why didn't the us re-occupy iraq and cut isis off along the border from within iraq, and purge them in iraq while assad purged them from syria?
why did the us sell even more weapons to saudi arabia and turkey, even though it's obvious to even the layman that those states were supporting isis?
then, look at us's history.
why did the us stay in afghanistan when bin laden was in pakistan?
why did the us lie about saddam having wmds?
why is iran still made out to be the big bad scary monster?
why was egypt's military backed when it deleted the new egyptian democracy after the arab spring?
why was libya abandoned after ghaddafi was killed?
surely, if the us cared about terrorism, it wouldn't have done all these things.
what about the million other things we use oil for?
good question.
we and the western world still have our own vast oil resources for those things.
if you’re asking, we (the us) don’t really use middle east oil here , china is the big consumer of middle east oil [link](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/07/dependence-on-middle-eastern-oil-now-its-chinas-problem-too/259947/) thanks for this.
tired of people saying the middle east is all about oil.
it's about things, politics, cross roads from east to west, terrorism, sa and israeli relations, etc etc.
oil is so far down the list these days.
by those standards the us would have invaded venezuela or canada a long time ago to secure oil rights (or mexico) and it would have been a lot easier to do so, hell same fucking time zones :) exactly .
have you heard of [thomas barnett](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/thomas_p._m._barnett)?
he has a really interesting ted talk from a while ago about the future of us grand strategy and he seems pretty good although a little old i'll check it out.
thanks for the link.
several years ago i was lucky enough to hear a former official speak.
i wish i could remember his name.
he was pretty high up and was giving lectures on us policy and things.
it was an eye opening lecture if i've ever heard one.
i know he worked for the state department, might have even been a cabinet member under clinton or bush.
in any case i got tickets because i was in the military at the time.
it really showed my how wrong my assumptions of the world were.
the main objective is really iran here, syria is just a stepping stone.
the us administration wants to annihilate iran.
they're trying to help the saudis win.
i think its to establish military presence more than anything.
stir up chaos in a region, then deploy your troops and setup bases.
also gives them a chance to increase surveillance and setup missile defense systems in some locations.
russia uses the same strategy.
so we can deal with terrorist attacks on our shipping aimce the region still is incredibly important to flobal trade?
yeah, you can't ignore the middle east no matter how you try.
haha totally not an invasion i want everyone to realize something.
the iranians, iraqs, and syrians agreed to a deal to build an oil pipeline from iran, through iraq and syria, into europe.
they call it the friendship pipeline.
some in the west call it the islamic (lol) pipeline.
another proposed pipeline was from saudi arabia, through syria, turkey, and then into europe.
syria rejected this one.
this is why syria is a target by the saudi backed is, and saudi's allies.
it is why the us is pushing for a kurdish state, made out of syria, in between iraq and syria, so that it can be a puppet state to the saudis (who will simply arm the most loyal faction of kurds, most likely islamic nationalists), so they can circumvent syria's rejection.
remember that all the conflicts in iraq and syria have been because of this pipeline.
the friendship pipeline would muscle saudi arabia out of european markets, making their shipped oil more expensive when compared to the pipeline fuels.
also remember that all saudi oil equipment is brought, built, and managed by us companies (weapons too, but that's a different, but related story).
also include the us motivations for getting europe from russian oil to saudis thank you for posting this.
it's important that americans understand we are once again entering another gop resource war.
"war is a racket."
--us marine corps general smedley butler obama and the democrats were just as much a part of it.
so, which are the opposing forces in here?
iran, iraq and syria vs the us, turkey and sa?
with which side france and britain (or other eu countries) are?
shouldnt they be with iranians and co. since they will get cheaper oil?
the oil won't be cheaper necessarily.
saudi oil will just get more expensive.
france is...i'm not to knowledgeable about.
but britain tends to line up with american agendas.
that's interesting.
can you provide some sources to read more on this?
thanks in advance.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurasian_economic_union the eaeu eventually will include iran, china, russia and the rest of the current members and will stretch from the pacific ocean to the atlantic via the mediterranean and to the arctic circle to the arabian sea.
between pipelines, roads, rail lines, energy and commerce in general is going to be one massive market.
iran and china might not join but they'll make deals with the eaeu.
since 2003, i've always thought: 'we'll never get out of the middle east'.
now i suspect that the u.s. government doesn't want to get out of the middle east.
sure it costs a lot of money, but when you follow that money, you find the incentive to be perpetually at war.
[i mean, they've declared as much](https://www.salon.com/2017/08/08/blackwater-founder-erik-prince-cites-east-india-company-as-a-model-to-privatize-afghanistan-war/).
and the morons at td thought that he would keep us out of syria.
the us has created the mess in the middle east and trump continues to make it worse.
a good step would be cutting our ridicolously high military budget.
then maybe we could have a legitimate tax cut tl;dr, it's a change in how they're publicly counted, number is trending down not up per mattis, and they're fighting is, not the syrian regime.
bit of a contra-diction you might say 2,000 troops that are rotated monthly.
so, you have many troops that are gaining experience in syria.
it is not only wrong, but there are probably troops in yemen.
at least, it looks like russia and the us have a deal to not go against one another.
ohhh how much xp are they getting?
where are they and can i go there and count them?
syria has no oil unlike iraq so the reasons for the american gvt to have a military in the region no longer exist.
largely down to keeping russia out of the arab world that would only be really bad for russia.
an islamist state in syria like afghanistan or a pro us iraq.
none of these options are good for russia.
back to cold war with the russians and we start with mccarthyism.
2000?
is that missing a zero?
&gt;pai's proposed net neutrality repeal says those requirements and others adopted in 2015 are too onerous for isps.
disclosing price, fees and data caps is too fucking onerous?
if they can't handle that, they shouldn't be allowed to operate.
i've already lost all faith in the fcc and ajit pai.
i did my part as did millions of others.
how foolish of us to think we could outshout money.
that is why money = freedom of speech.
the best politicians you can buy.
&gt; we find many of those additional reporting obligations significantly increased the burdens imposed on isps without providing countervailing benefits to consumers or the commission.
no one can possibly beleive that telling a consumer what you are selling them and how much it will cost them is a burden on the proprietor without benefit to the consumer.
he knows he's spewing bullshit funny, i always found early termination fees burdensome and without benefit to consumers.
why haven't those been outlawed?
because you agree to the fees knowingly.
you don't knowingly agree to have someone lie to you about the product they sell you.
in every other business it is illegal to lie about what your product does.
he doesn't care.
got mine, fuck you rules.
fee = $xxxx.
so burdensome.
omigod!
the craziest thing is how the conflict of interest of ajit pai has by having connections with the isp’s that he is creating benefits for, is not as big of a deal as it should be.
that should already disqualify any claims he makes.
should being the key word there.
people **should** have access to healthcare.
people **should** have equal civil rights.
people **should** decide for themselves on the abortion debate.
people **should** have a direct line to those chosen to represent them.
instead we have career politicians deciding law of public interest based on who pays them the most money.
&gt;instead we have career politicians deciding law of public interest based on who pays them the most money.
the voice of the american people has spoken: *shut up, bitch.
* his only connection was that he was a low level attorney at verizon for 3 years more than 14 years ago.
otherwise almost all of the rest of his nearly 20 year long career has been in public services at regulatory agencies.
if that is all it takes to create a conflict of interest, then i don’t see many people ever being allowed into public service.
how can anyone see this as anything other than a corporate give-away?
this will end up in court for years if the repeal actually goes through given the increasing frequency of mass shootings, i find it absolutely mind-boggling that nobody has thought to walk into the hqs of comcast and verizon and others of their ilk and just start shooting.
you'd figure they'd be target numerous uno for angry people who've decided they have nothing left to lose given how widely reviled they are the country over and i can't think of a louder statement to make about corporate bullshit than a ceo being filled with enough lead to warrant a closed casket funeral.
expect a knock on your door.
pretty sure ur not even using a vpn.
it is only internet regulations.
nobody is going to get shot over that and nobody should be shot over it.
calm down with the dramatics.
i'd bet a lot of money that *someone* dies as a result of this.
that would be the saddest thing ever.
there is no reason for anyone to get hurt over this.
that's true, but let's be real here.
it's america.
someone is definitely gonna be shot over this.
its internet, not a pair of jordan's.
[removed] should we be tolerating and donating money to pedophiles like the moral republicans or nah?
no self respecting republican would ever donate to the podesta group.
well the funny thing is they donate to the guy that actually has *admitted* to being a creep.
good try though.
just joking, truly pathetic!
sad!
i'd rather donate to a creep than advocate murder... you should aspire to be like me and do neither!
yes this yahoo speaks for the entire left side of the political spectrum...................... yay for "job creators"!
these guys just don't get enough recognition for the fine job they all do of lining their pockets collecting risk-free rents and building insurmountable barriers to competition to protect their monopolies at our expense.
if we could all aspire to produce absolutely nothing but waste and redundancies, we too might be so virtuous.
might i have another bowl of gruel, governor?
only if you can spare it of course...
&gt;verheul said that canada wants a net neutrality provision included in nafta, noting: &gt;"we are including provisions such as online consumer protection to ensure that that is provided for and we also have provisions to provide personal information protection, which we feel is essential in this kind of trade, along with our position that we want to protect net neutrality when it comes to digital trade."
this is potentially golden.
you can't pass a law that negates a treaty with a foreign nation.
trump won't make this deal but if a future president did it would restore net neutrality for all of us in a way that couldn't simply be overturned by the next fascist regime.
how is repealing a government regulation fascism?
that is literally the total opposite.
it’s a good plan, but i don’t think you know what fascism is.
did i define fascism somewhere?
(i must have missed that part of my post.)
good to see america standing up for what's right!
(...the us isn't the only nation in the americas.)
then it's not america standing up for what's right, it's a subsection.
if everyone in a company supports child labor apart from one division, that doesn't mean the company stands up for what's right.
so, if my dog so much as barks, a cop can shoot it... but these "trained" officers can't keep their mutt under control?
worse, if you shoot the dog in self defense you'd likely be charged with a major felony.
and the mutt gets a better pension than you.
&gt;police apologized to collins while she was in the hospital, said steve linders, a st. paul police spokesman.
that won't make her less afraid of the police or their dogs you can't show fear towards them or they will attack.
and the same goes for the dogs https://giphy.com/gifs/jon-hamm-7wfdpankqzfuw the officer (schmidt) seems to have a history of issues, including controlling his k9 previously, yet not only is he still a cop, he's still a cop in the k9 unit.
wtf?
are they that short of cops up there?
sounds like he needs a promotion to get him out of the field so he can't do any more harm.
k9s are crazy anyhow.
i've trained a lot of dogs for personal defence, they'd never attack someone without a good reason.
k9s are similar to the dogs you see thugs with walking around saying, "sick em."
he pleaded guilty to a dui.
that can get you fired from/prevent you for being hired for so many jobs.
but it's a slap on the wrist for someone whose duty is to "protect and serve."
if my dog bit an innocent person while on a leash like that, it'd be put down.
that was 100% handler fuckup.
dog was doing his job, insofar as he understood it.
the handler failed to control his animal and should be fired.
no failure here, this is par for the course for america.
look at all the videos and reports of police dog attacks, or police using police dogs in situations inappropriate for them.
in each and every case: you have someone screaming on the ground as the dog sinks its teeth into the poor guy's head or arm, and all the cops do is vaguely beg it to stop while tugging on the leash.
to someone who knows how dog handling or police dog handling is supposed to go, these are gross failures on the part of the handler.
as far as american police are concerned, this is the standard.
just as it would be 100% handler fuckup if my dog bit an innocent person while on a leash.
handler fuckup doesn't mean it doesn't get put down.
but your dog is not a k9 unit.
this dog is literally trained to bite people, putting it down when it does that makes no sense.
it's the handling officer's job to control the animal, and allow it to bite the suspect only, and only if necessary.
dude had way too much leeway on that leash.
not the animal's fault.
you can’t blame a dog for being a dog.
especially not a highly trained dog doing what it has been trained to do.
so, do we put down the handler?
we'd probably need to make that a law first.
laws for thee, not for me.
so the handler is being charged with assault?
oh that's right it's america... if your dog barked in a general direction of an leo it would probably be put down.
i can understand what you are trying to say, but there´s a difference here, of course the dog should never bite someone innocent, but he´s trained to bite suspects and your personal dog isn´t.
the dog was doing his job and the handler couldn´t control him, the job of a dog that isn´t a k-9 dog is not to bite people or to act in any way shape or form aggressive to anyone in public.
with a proper handler a k-9 dog does all the right things, but a private dog that is aggressive towards people on the street is really hard to be contained or retrained and the owner failed to train his/her dog from the beginning and the dog propably cant or wont be properly trained by his current handler, so you either put him for the rest of his life in a cage, put him down or let him bite the next person he comes across when he snaps.
so really what you're saying is dogs are stupid and should have nothing to do with police work?
no, i'm saying they are doing what they are trained for.
they were on the chase for a suspect which means the dog was propably given the commando to search for them and was on "high alert", which is why i cant understand them holding him on such a long leash.
dogs are really smart and they can understand a lot of things, but they have to be trained properly to do so.
if the handler doenst do his job right, the dog will do stuff like this.
plenty of privately owned dogs are trained to bite strangers.
when they maul innocent strangers, though, we still usually have them put down, regardless of that training, because improperly controlled dogs trained to attack strangers are considered a danger to the public, and having mauled an innocent stranger is evidence of improper control.
maybe that shouldn't be our response, but it currently is, and i don't see any particular reason that police dogs should be an exception to our laws on the treatment of dangerous improperly controlled dogs.
like i said these private dogs normally have nobody that has the time or just were steered so much in the wrong direction, so they "cant" be trained to be normal or just normal guard dogs.
i would love for dogs that bite to be rehabiliated by a dog trainer but the reality sadly is, most of the time there is nobody that wants to do that.
i dont know how it is exactly handled in the us, but i know from a story in germany where an off-duty police dog bit someone and that dog was put down, maybe there is a difference being made between off and on-duty for these dogs and thats why this dog does not have to be put down.
i also want to add that i think that most police dogs have the basics of what they are supposed to do and what not to do, meaning they have the proper basics to be build up on to get the dog to being a good k-9 dog, whereas private dogs that are agressive against people have never learned the right way to respond to people.
i recently had an encounter on a popular tourist site with a dog, where i asked the owner if i could pet the dog from a bit away and as i was in about 2 m range the dog just went berzerk and "defended" his owner and got praise for it.
that is an example for a dog that shouldnt be out on the streets theres something bound to happen and that dog thinks hes doing everything right and never learnt it better and until he bites someone and i honestly think you can't train the dog to react any other way and he will bite again and again which is just a risk to the general public.
edit: https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/weltgeschehen/article111493398/bayerischer-polizeihund-faellt-sechs-kinder-an.html link for the article with the incident in germany.
sadly it is in german, but the general sense is, the dog owner is being charged with assault and the dog which was still in training is being checked on by proffesionalls of the police if it has to be put down or can be trained.
if your dog even looked an [officer while wagging it's tail, it would be put down.
](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/07/what-dog-shootings-reveal-about-american-policing/533319/) they just stood there and looked at her screaming in the beginning...... then surely trying to pull her away from the dog would just cause her skin to rip more?
that's what i was wondering.
i'm not sure what procedure they're supposed to use, but wouldn't pulling her in one direction while pulling the dog in the other just make him bite down harder?
i used to have to pry my dog's jaws open to make him release whatever he's chewing on.
it looked like they were afraid to tell the dog it was doing a bad thing.
even though that person was innocent they still want their dog to be trained to attack people, if they told their dog it was doing something wrong then next time it wouldn't do it.
but it still should have been trained well enough to cease on command, poorly trained dog and poorly trained handlers.
so the dog ignored multiple commands from its handler to release her, bit down harder on her, and had to be physically removed from her?
don't cops routinely shoot violent and aggressive dogs like this one?
&gt; in a statement on thursday, police chief todd axtell said his “heart breaks” when he sees body camera footage of the incident.
nobody cares if his heart breaks.
his wallet is what needs to break.
and that dog needs to be put down.
it is obviously improperly trained and unable to respond to whatever training it did supposedly have.
it is just another violent and aggressive dog that represents a danger to the community at large.
whoever trained that dog should be fired for incompetence.
&gt;don't cops routinely shoot violent and aggressive dogs like this one?
[nope, just the non-violent ones](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/07/what-dog-shootings-reveal-about-american-policing/533319/) why didn't she shoot the dog?
it's just a dog, they can buy another... 👮 that is assault on an office you will be murdered for that.
no, it's property destruction.
but yeah, probably will be killed by a low-iq cop with a badge and gun on duty k9s are considered officers for legal purposes.
unless a cop locks one in a car in and it dies, then it's just a dog again.
just one of the magical dualities of police dogs.
they are not, that is a myth.
they are police animals, not officers.
i'd say you could make a good self defense case if you manage to avoid the being murdered part.
i believe they meant the cops shooting the dog.
they have no problem doing that to citizens' pooches.
but the second amendment is supposed to allow us to protect ourselves from the mean government :( defending your life from officer snookums surely counts.
the dog should have been shot and i hope she gets millions.
they apologized?
fuck that!
they just stood there and watched.
could have used a non lethal weapon on the obviously out of control dog, instead of petting it while it bites her.
police dogs have zero purpose.
they cant reliably produce accurate results.
looks like they didn’t see her and she spooked the dog.
unfortunate accident.
i’m sure she will get a good size check.
it's not the dog's fault.
it's the cop that needs to be put down.
how do we know that trash bag wasn't loaded?
that woman was clearly resisting arrest.
it got reattached, they were both drunk, and on drugs.
not sure how you decipher the story on this one, i do not envy the officers.
both where drinking but only the attacker admitted to drug use.
she was just having a ball thank you for this he claims he was trying to make her leave.
she claims he was trying to stop her from leaving.
i decipher it to mean "two fucked-up drunk poo-butts have a misunderstanding and get extremely hurty with each other" i'm assuming the guilty party (the women in this case) is lying.
i decipher "she claimed she had been acting in self defence, but was convicted of assault" to mean his claim was probably the accurate one.
respect to them, but also mad props to the doctors.
regardless of whether she was under the influence i think its safe to say that every member of the male species will be sleeping easier once shes sentenced if a man used his teeth to rip apart female genitalia, he would be jailed for life.
this punishment is a disgrace.
&gt;del viscio has been placed on a restriction of liberty order for six months, which means she must stay at home between 22:00 and 06:00. appearing for sentence at edinburgh sheriff court, she was also ordered to pay her victim £500 compensation.
that's a fucking disgrace.
so basically she's grounded?
i wouldn't even say that, it's more like a curfew.
aren’t people grounded with curfews?
yeah, basically.
no she just has to be home by 10 pm and not go out before 6 am.
how does a curfew stop you from buying booze or drugs?
it doesn't'.
when i was grounded i wasn't allowed to go out and play until 10pm... i wish my parents were this lenient when i was a kid lol and she’s giving up her allowance.
[deleted] she mutilated him.
she should be in prison.
they should take one of her balls!
because girls have balls, right?
they have ovaries, which are developed from the same place.
(just like the female clitoral hood is the male foreskin, skene's gland is the prostate, etc) should be dead they were both fucked out of their heads.
hard to parse mens rea when you’re out of your mind.
voluntary intoxication is usually not a defense for a crime.
the fact they were both off their heads and she had massive facial bruising and no previous record is mitigating, though.
illegal drug use is probably an aggravating factor if anything.
the facial bruising could go either way depending on whose story is more credible as to whether him hitting her was self defense.
i agree that having no prior record of violence is a significant mitigating factor though.
if someone was biting my nuts off i'd probably be repeatedly bashing them in the face to try to get them to let go... that’s one believable version of the story.
counter offer- a man knocks you down and straddle should you and is beating your face in, what’re you going to bite?
where's the physical evidence she was knocked down and being straddled?
well she shouldnt have ripped that mens rea off with her teeth in the first place.
seriously.
£500 isn't going to cover the drinking i would be doing to help console myself after a mess like this.
this is a huge double standard, if he doesn't appeal this i will be upset.
pretty sure this would require single malt administered via intravenous drip.
well, she was injured in the struggle, too, but the man faces no charges.
he claims he was fighting her off.
she claims she was fighting him off.
they were both drunk and on drugs, so it's hard to say who to believe.
the doctors were able to repair the damage, and thanks to nhs he won't have any medical bills to cover.
so why does there need to be a huge penalty?
if someone is punching you in the face is it a self-defense move to bite their testicles?
no.
if someone is biting your testicles is it a self-defense move to bash them in the face so they let go?
yes.
uh if someone is bashing my face in i'm going to do literally whatever i can to make them stop.
that includes biting.
if someone is beating me to a bloody pulp fairness sort of goes out the window.
biting someones testicles is going to make them bash your face more not less that's why it's not a self-defense move because it doesn't defend yourself.
could potentially make them stop long enough to regain your footing and extricate yourself from the situation though.
i don't imagine he was particularly functional or cognizant after that.
if it's a bite release run maybe but based on the injuries that's clearly not what this was.
do you really think getting a couple bruises in your face while your biting someone's testicle and trying to tear it out is equal in terms of the trauma to the person?
if this was the reverse and the punishment were the same i sincerely doubt this would be something that people would need to argue about.
did i say it was equal?
i don't think the severity of injuries is relevant in this situation.
they both claim self defense, and neither of them is reliable.
feel free to speculate as much as you like what would be relevant or not in a completely different situation.
any investigator worth his salt wouldn't look at this as "he said she said, nothing we can do."
this isn't speculation, and what you're describing is absolutely not how legality is analyzed and not how injuries and domestic incidents are analyzed.
in order to be able to come to an opinion of "if their roles were reversed, this would not have been the solution," is by looking at historically similar cases and how they've been resolved.
an investigator also wouldn't just go "well she's hit and so is he, so fair play," they would try to analyze where the injuries occurred, what instruments or body parts were used to apply those injuries and then try to dissect a time line of who initiated what, in what positions would their bodies have been in in order to make this injury possible, and then take in witness testimony (there were multiple friends in their flat during this altercation) to extrapolate the likeliness of the timeline hypothesized.
if 500 bucks is my reward for having to have surgery on my testicles after allowing someone to come into my apartment and hang out i would appeal that case and take her trial if the appeals process didn't provide a more suitable settlement.
the male is missing time from work, likely could plead psychological damages, and was assaulted in their own home.
&gt; they were both drunk and *she was* on drugs, so it's hard to say who to believe.
i'm going with the guy who was not convicted of assault, wasn't on drugs, and had the more believable story.
it wouldn't even cover the plastic surgery &amp; fake testicle.
it's disgusting.
&gt;he was taken to edinburgh royal infirmary, where his testicle was put back into the scrotum and he was given 15 stitches.
they managed to save it.
scottish nhs.
goodguys.
judges in the u.k. have been ordered to show more leniency to women.
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1311004/judges-ordered-mercy-women-criminals-deciding-sentences.html i'd suggest linking something better than daily mail if you want to convince people.
government stats would be best.
it's not an opinion piece.
it's reporting an actual edict from the judicial studies board.
https://youtu.be/rkskvzoucpq bill burr... says it best... one chesticle for one testicle- that sounds fair.
bro, men murder women and don't get a life sentence.
don't be delusional.
horse.
shit.
men go to prison just for being emotionally close to women when they die all the time.
http://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/15/us/transgender-hate-crime-murder-sentence-mississippi/index.html well, looks like you're wrong.
&gt;49 year sentence you win on the technical "not a life sentence" side, but are you really going to argue that he got off lightly?
using his stupid logic, we can't know if it was a life sentence until the 49 years are up.
if he dies, then my statement was true.
but thats just being stupid, like his pretending that a tiny fine and a 49 year jail sentence are equal in severity.
i never said anything was equal.
i said it wasn't life.
what's your native language?
i'd love for you to quote me saying "lightly".
it's just retarded to say if the sexes in the op were reversed that the man would get a life sentence.
am i wrong?
[removed] try to keep up with what exactly?
that you're an aggressive, rude person who doesn't know what words mean?
[removed] you seem mighty triggered.
i suggest you keep to your safe space.
this is reddit where we’re freaking out about male genocide.
just like when women got the privilege to vote, men will go extinct.
&gt; if a man used his teeth to rip apart female genitalia, he would be jailed for life.
any examples?
there was this one recently - not a life sentence, but he was sentenced to 45 years at age 46.
(technically he'll probably serve half of the 45 given that it's in state court).
https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/11/28/man-who-cut-off-ex-girlfriends-nipples-sentence-45-years-prison/903676001/ she was also pregnant and he beat her up couple of times... right - he definitely deserved the sentence he received.
your example is from the us, this thread is about smth happening in the uk.
also in your example much more happened.
in the case here discussed the women "bit his left testicle".
in your example, the guy choked her, strangled her, hit her so hard that she became unconscious and then cut her nipples off with a scissor.
the women was also pregnant and with his violent behavior he not only endangered her life but also the baby's one.
additionally he has been arrested for other crimes before, this was more like a final straw.
all of that is significantly more than what happened in the story above.
sure, so 45 years would be too long.
the argument is that a £500 fine and a curfew is not a reasonable or sufficient punishment for mutilating the sexual organs of another person.
sure, those differences definitely account for some of the disparity in sentencing.
but i don't think that those differences quite manage to bridge the gap between the two cases.
it's been shown that women tend to receive less in the way of criminal punishment than men do for the same crimes, but who knows if that is what occurred here.
video re-enactment of the attack.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zhgtr6-e6xq actual video of the attack: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fftnexg-wfg sad part is, stuff like this never makes it to twox.
change the genders, and this would have been the top post this morning.
he says she was destroying a room and when asked to stop, they argued and she got his testicle close enough to bite it, he beat her trying to get her off of him.
she says that she tried to leave and he shoved her to the ground and began beating her, and she didn't even know what she had bitten was his testicle.
so he had no pants on and they were arguing while on drugs.
i can only think of two reasons why his genitals would have been by her face in such a scenario.
they were either wrestling during the altercation or he tried to put his genitals in her face during it.
who knows, maybe she was performing oral sex and suddenly went crazy and they are both lying for some reason.
in any case, she was convicted of assault, has 6 months probation, and a fine.
he has 15 stitches and a whole scrotum.
i can think of a third she put his testicles in her face to bite.
well yeah, but i'm still curious about what set of circumstances led to her being in an optimal position to chomp down on his nuts.
she couldn't have just lunged at him, teeth gnashing.
were they so drugged out that he didn't notice her positioning herself between his legs?
were they grappling?
i mean she could've just lunged at him i would've dodged a lunge but that doesn't mean he did she could've also just done the i'm not leaving leg grab thing and bite them from there or pretended to offer a blowjob.
there's tons of ways to get there.
&gt;he was taken to edinburgh royal infirmary, where his testicle was put back into the scrotum and he was given 15 stitches.
i am amazed they can reattach it.
of course all she gets is a light slap on the wrist.
if the roles were reversed, oh boy... yeah, a woman with testicles would be a sensation ;-) there are plenty of women with testicles, it's not a big deal unless you're in a particularly conservative locale.
which women with testicles move out of asap.
90's flashback: [the bobbit's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_and_lorena_bobbitt) jesus, this headline is nuts.
i want to downvote you for this *so badly* for this, but just can't i went for the *low hanging fruit* and i'm sorry.
yeah, you may have bit off a bit more than you could chew.
good to know where all the incels landed... del viscio said: "as he came to me i bit him.
i just remember a noise and blood pouring into my mouth."
she's talking bollocks.
well, how else did they get into her mouth?
how does someone get close enough to your balls to bite them without some nookie being involved?
hey girls, don't bite off testicles.
hey guys don't hook up with testicle biter types.
now go have fun.
there's no indication in this story that she bit him through clothing he was wearing.
so why were his testicles exposed and out to where she could have bitten one off?
this sounds a lot like an attempted rape that was stopped.
she'll be co-hosting the next golden globes with tina fey and amy poehler.
i like your style "i think i tore my sac" only 500 is compensation lol.
never stick your dick in crazy boyz &gt; never stick your dick in crazy boyz yeah, because you might not get to pull it back out.
it's like one of those chinese finger traps, then suddenly a testicle gets in there and then she gives birth to triplets.
“what did i just say?” i'm sorry, but the uk is fucking insane.
rip a man's ball out, 500 quid and a curfew.
eat bacon in front of muslims, jail time.
holy fuck it hurts just reading the headline i remember that episode of supernatural.
i dropped my phone and quickly grabbed my crotch with both hands after reading the headline.
yeah i believe in equal treatment for all but i’d beat the hell out of her.
also when the media came around i’d be 110% unapologetic.
sorry ladies i’m for the equal treatment of you all out there but that?
yeah i’d half a mind to kill you.
just cause i’m for you doesn’t mean i overlook the harming of another and especially a body part that is so dear to us men.
i mean couldn’t you of bit a chunk out of his leg?
his asscheek?
arm?
no you had to go for the crown jewels.
edit: this comment was made in shock to the headline before reading the article, i have now read the article, and i think i still stand firm.
although fueled by drugs and alcohol, it was an argument that led to her attacking, him trying to beat her off of him (understandably i may add) and her being convicted of assault.
so i stand firm.
downvotes?
i’m guessing defending yourself isn’t a big thing for people.
look all i’m saying is id be hitting her in the head with a lamp or anything really to get her off.
i mean how is one supposed to act when you get your testies latched on to?
whatever emotion i was experiencing at the time would go straight to panic and terror which would ultimately fuel my attempts to escape, and in that panic is where i can’t guarantee what happens, all i would know is i want [insert whatever] off my testicles.
if it’s a woman and she gets hurt in the process, well i’m sorry it had to be this way, but you’re latched on to my nuts, i want you off.
i shouldn’t have to defend this lol you stand firm by his side of the story even though they were both inebriated?
no, i stand firm by my comment that regardless of what it is attached to my testicles, even if it’s a women, i’m gonna do whatever i need to do to get it off if i don’t want it there.
i’m a pretty tolerant guy, and i’ll take a lot of shit, bite my nuts though and i’ll put that woman’s head up her own ass.
i mean i got boundaries lol which i think is fair.
they learned how to bang rocks together and make pointed rocks *ouch* and how to rip out testicles with their own teeth *yeouch* if that happened to me... - ..well.. at the very least.. - - --i'd be *a bit teste* i wouldn't normally advocate violence but i feel like once the pain subsided for a moment your only option would be to go full sgt.
hartman on a motha fucka how the fuck is a company going to keep a person on their staff after this?
must be fucking nice to have that kind of privilege.
/r/feminism in a nutshell.
hmm.
so beaten.
probably was an attempted rape, and she bit off his junk.
how else would she be able to get to it otherwise?
what do you think is the natural reaction to someone biting off your testicle?
it's to bash them in the face as hard as possible repeatedly and if she opened with biting his testicle it would be easy to get at.
how did the guy not go hulk on her and rip her apart for that?
and washes it down with a bottle of dasani water?
let's look on the bright side.
at least it was just one testicle.
how can women like this exist in this world?
and where can i meet them?
you crazy bro.
no, seriously, stay the fuck away from me.
this bitch makes lorena bobbitt look like a princess.
what's worse?
getting your balls bit off or only getting fucking $600 for it!
&gt; toys “r” us has won approval to pay $16 million in bonuses to 17 top executives if the company hits financial targets during the holiday shopping season.
at least read the article before complaining.
the key word is "if" here.
if...if is good i'm about to rearrange the cosmos and the one schlemiel who can louse it up is walking around in the woods?!
one of my favorite disney villains.
i wish i could blow my hair up like that when i'm mad.
villain?
here are the facts.. 1) zeus unlawfully usurped the titan government 2) zeus imprisoned the titans without trial or even evidence of wrong doing.
3) zeus effectively exiled his own brother to the underworld.
but ya, hades is the bad guy hades is so misrepresented in media.
i can’t think of one thing bad that guy did,except the persephone thing but she embraced that queen of the dead thing pretty quick.
zues screwed a lady as a swan and turned another into a cow.
fuck that guy.
a lot of people did, and that's why we have all those heroes and demigods.
that’s fair athena was the goddess of wisdom, but turned a girl who weaved better than her into a spider.
the gods were as petty as we mortals, just more powerful.
the modern perception of him is influenced by the christian view of hell.
[this is a good video on how the depiction of hades have changed over time](https://youtu.be/kmcv90cya1y) zeus sprung free from his titan masters and usurped their tyranical ways.
also, way before modern concepts of justice were developed.
also, the titans were known to disdain future concepts of justice and would ignore justice in favor of enslavement again.
what zeus did was for the good of everyone.
not to mention cronus tried to fucking eat him.
he did swallow zeus, but zeus mama tricked cronus and helped free zeus.
my point still remains valid.
anyone who overthrows a hierarchy that is ok with consumption of their own kin is a good guy in my book.
even if he has this weird thing for beastiality.
hades wasn't exiled.
the three brothers drew lots.
poseidon got the sea, hades the underworld and zeus the sky.
so yeah, zeus won the draw but there is not a single text i read about greek mythology where hades is saw as an evil god or even mad.
he's a necessary god, feared because you don't really want to meet him but still, not a villain indeed, on that i agree with you :) hades also got all the wealth below ground as compensation for the shitty real estate situation.
shitty, shitty... we'll see about that in time but there's no way some accommodations haven't been made after all this time.
i'm sure the dude is having a blast down there.
at least that's what she said "disney" villain.
you know, because in the movie he is a villain.
the interpretation of hades made by disney turned him into a villain.
edit: i'm not saying the hades from mythology is a bad guy.
he is as he is.
sounds like my favorite author https://www.amazon.com/reign-hell-novel-steven-brust/dp/0312870493 i want to do a lot of drugs with you.

holy shit i never understood that line until you wrote it out, thank you coming your most lugubriousness!
not really.. key word is what are the targets?
its kinda easy to sound all nobel, if you set your goals so low that they are achievable by sitting in your underwear watching tv.
i notice that if they do even better that number will go up to 32 million but they suspect that would be quite hard.
which makes me suspect, the 16 million is really a retention bonus to replace the retention bonuses they had to return and they sent the goal of sales targets, low enough to make sure the bonuses are definite.
of course my theory on this, depends on actually seeing the numbers.
lets see what the sales goals are.
lets see last years figure.
and then i wont complain.
because its so easy to make this look noble even if it isnt.
hey maybe i am wrong and its just a coincidence that they got these bonuses after being ordered to return the illegal ones.
and they really are serious sales targets.. at least matching last years.
but we cant know based on article.
so pitchfork still sharpened and ready.
one could reasonably assume that was the job of the court in this case - to make sure that the targets would bring in enough income to justify the bonuses.
if they weren’t serious targets i don’t know why the court would have approved them.
i've also read in some other articles that part of the reason they give these large bonuses is to retain their upper management when those executives know the company is going downhill and could move on to better opportunities.
they are paying them to sit to the bitter end, because they need skilled management to liquidate, trade, sell the remaining assets and fragments of the company.
i know an attorney that worked for enron from the day they imploded til the day they shut the doors for good (about 4 years in between) and she made damn good money to stay til the end.
wow, it really took 4 years to finish it off?
i grew up in houston and it seemed like an overnight downfall.
i'm glad the astros finally took home a world series to enron field uhhh i mean minute maid park, though!
for a while at the very end it was just a skeleton crew administering the final business of ending things.
funnily enough i was just reading about this yesterday.
one of the ways enron cooked the books was to enter into thousands of partnerships with other businesses, report all projected earnings up front to pad earnings and push the stock price up, and continue to report them even when the partnerships fell apart.
they also formed thousands of shell companies to hide their debt from investors.
in addition, they owned power plants and pipelines all over the country and eventually the world, many of which existed as wholly owned stand alone companies (likely to shield enron if they (eg) exploded).
on top of that, to extend their profitability, they had various arms that did non-energy production/distribution related things - for example they had an arm that acted like an investment firm and sometimes a hedge fund (**enron finance corp**) - they had a section that operated as a trader for natural gas (**enron capital &amp; trade**) - they had a website, **enrononline**, which was a trading platform for over 500 products such as gas, electricity, bankruptcy swaps, pulp, gas, plastics, paper, steel and even tv commercial time - and in 1997, under the name **ftv communications llc**, they constructed a 1,380 mile fiber optic network between portland and las vegas, and then under the name **enron broadband services** tried to create a market for buying and selling bandwidth, eventually entering a 20 year deal with blockbuster to stream movies - and many many more.
as a result, while they declared bankruptcy in december of 2001, they didn't sell their last business - prisma energy - until 2006, after which they changed their name to **enron creditors recovery corporation** and focused on trying to repay creditors, which it was still doing as late as 2009. so yeah, even after they stopped doing business, there was at least a good eight years worth of work to be done.
an interesting accounting point about enron - they didn't just recognize projected earnings in the current period - they would package futures on projected energy revenues and sell them to people and then record that revenue in the current period.
seems like a minor difference but people are still arguing about it today and it has a lot of relevance on the revenue accounting standards that we are nowadays &gt; wow, it really took 4 years to finish it off?
would you believe that arthur andersen is still a company that exists?
my friends father was a executive for tyco international, not only did he not get any money, he was laid off and went through hours and hours of depositions even though he had nothing to do with it.
til!
i used to offer corporate it support to tyco in australia around 2000. used to be great to work for.
we had an arrangement with their office boss for cream on the server orders (ie we assembled and deployed 20 remote servers for their offices and we would get one as a thank you (each order) these were athlon 1ghz with 2gb ram.
definitely not cheap at the time.
that sounds sorta ... illegal?
not at all illegal.
it would be the same as giving someone a tip or commission for hard work, or a job well done.
now, there may have been a crime committed depending on how that tyco exec reported that gift/tip.
if s/he accurately reported where that money went by reporting it as a business gift, bonus, commission, tip, etc, then everything is ok. if s/he lied about where the money went (e.g.
reporting it as loss, theft, overhead, etc), then that may possibly constitute fraud, embezzlement, etc.
the act of giving that it group a tip/gift is legal, but lying about it would be illegal.
to be fair, if something gonna to make a hard landing, you need to spend extra on good hands to save the most anyways.
the guy actually made it start to fall usually long gone before anyone else noticed.
while thousands of employees lose their source of income for the sake of profit.
all of this sounds reasonable until you realize how inherently fucked up the entire structure is.
edit: maybe the company wouldn't be bankrupt if they didn't concentrate profit to the top and actually invested in improving their business?
it's apparent that certain companies refuse to adapt.
cable companies, anyone?
🤔 not to mention the current top guy was in after it start to fall, if he can land it with more parts intact, why won't he deserve the reward?
correct, but a $1 million bonus for staying at your job is still quite repulsive.
i can guarantee you they won't give bonuses to their employees, but simply expect their loyalty.
there is no shortage of desperate workers.
they don't need to treat you well if they know there are 10 people behind you willing to do your job.
nah i understand the reasoning behind it, still think it's a shit system though.
a $ 1 million bonus is ridiculous no matter how amazing your management skills are.
not really no, the skill might mean saving $15m oh trust me, i know, but to them it's peanuts.
their bonuses are generally based on a small percentage of net revenues.
my best friends wife's best friend is the daughter of a billionaire who owns one of the largest telecom companies in north america.
she has a billion dollar trust fund.
her brother is some made up executive position that does nothing but party and he gets massive bonus like this so long as net revenue is over a certain threshold.
to them a million dollars in laughable since they make more than that off their trusts alone.
personally i think it should be mandated that bonus should be paid equally companywide.
and maybe have some rules like management can get up to 5-10x more.
salaries can stay however they want, but at least if they made that change when money is good and huge bonuses are rolling in everyone benefits.
so being a toysrus employee will be an even greater nightmare than normal with that added pressure of "if" on their heads.
gotta get our high level execs their bonuses, guys!
nah, you know your job's gone after the holidays anyways, and it's not like they'll hire new people.
they'll try and push this but i don't think the employees have much reason to care.
that's a huge fucking bonus for 17 people less than a million each is not a huge for an executive bonus.
for normal people it is, though.
so what's the going rate for executives who can get a company toys r us's size through a bankruptcy then?
i honestly don't know but it sounds like you do.
it really isn’t.. if that really pisses you off, then i would avoid looking into what executives really get paid in comparison to this.
reddit is the king of leaving out details in the title that drastically change the message.
op posts for that karma.
a sensationalized title cutting out the important part.
at this point, what will these execs really have done to create these sales to reach these targets?
this is an absolute joke if toys r us just converted into a giant boardgame, miniature and pop culture collectable outlet i feel like they might be able to turn shit around.
we have a store here called the "discovery hut" which is always packed with people.
half the store is board games, a quarter of it is educational toys and the rest is a mix of cool popular toys and collectables.
it's a awesome store.
when i go into toys r us i feel like i'm in a giant aisle of the walmart toys section, except it's not as organized and a fair bit dirtier.
yea, what ever happened to the iconic geoffrey the giraffe character and the "i don't want to grow up, i'm a toys r us kid" jingle?
those were power houses in the 80s.
*selfish edit: wouldn't it have been cool to see a collab between toys r us and vans?
vans is doing a shit ton of retro collabs with disney, nintendo, thrasher, etc.. not saying it would have saved the company but 9yr old me wants a traditional vans snapback with geoffrey on it or "i don't want to grow up" vans tee.
w/e - i just grew up with toys r us, hope it doesn't completely disappear.
* shit tier marketing.
kids would rather have an app than a toy i guess?
every toys r us is filthy anyways.
my 5 and 9 year olds list this year was paltry (3 and 2 two items respectively).
i asked the 9 year old why she only listed a giftcard to justice and some craft thing to make bracelets and her answer was, apparently speaking for both of them, “we have ipads.” i doubt im the only one with kids that have that same thought process.
my kids don't have ipads.
they love toys r us.
i loathe toys r us.
i should get my kids ipads.
don't get them ipads.
get'em a zune nah, an old casette walkman.
give them an imagination i stopped shopping there when they stopped letting me ride the children’s bicycles and electric cars around their store.
i'm sure they have their reasons for stopping you riding the kid's bike.
use to work for tru for two years, can confirm it's dirty, but i still appreciated richard's hard work.
i can't say for the american branches, but in australia, babies section slowly took over the whole damn store, and focus of the business.
same here in tx.
toys r us moved in with babies r us and were given half the store, usually less.
the internet killed them.
this is the correct answer.
toys are non-perishable and easier to buy online if toys rust had competitive pricing, they might have been fine.
instead, everything there costs an arm and a leg toys r us price matches everyone.
the argument that price is an issue is not applicable here.
edit: didn't think i'd get downvoted for telling people you can get things cheaper.
did i mention that tru donates $1 to toys for tots with every price match they do?
for a consumer to know they're walking in to bloated prices that will only come down if they do research to find a better price that they then need to provide proof of to some unknown higher rusty power that is not the cashier.. thus pissing off every single stressed, overtired parent in line behind said price matching customer.. is enough to deter traffic.
it is definitely applicable.
the problem is their floor space they have too much of it.
combine that with the amount of merchandise they probably already have a transition may be stupidly hard or impossible.
best bet would be combining with an online front to be able to unload their product.
amazon x toys r us.
and no one actually buys.
had 2 of those here in the last 10 years.
always packed but went out of business after a year i would love to see them carry more hobby shop type board games, seeing how i don't live anywhere near a flgs.
what is their demographic?
kids 0-5 they play with kinetic toys.
this seems to be what is left of their core demographic.
6-12 they have lost these kids.
once kids move into online games they pretty much stop playing with toys.
the app stores are huge but they get into animal jam, minecraft, the 101 games and they all consume kids time.
some merch spills over into the real world but it feeds back into the games.
13-15 school, homework, online life, maybe extracurricular activities, but toys?
nope.
youtube and streamers have become a pretty big occupier.
if they aren’t playing games they are watching funny skits about those games, or watching streamers play other games.
16-18 barely steps foot inside a toys r us.
adults childhood revival has been big for genx and millennials but they grew up mostly with saturday morning cartoons and toys.
online mostly services the collectible crowd.
but even the retail space is crowded by leaner stores like box lunch, hot topic and a few mom and pop stores like the “discovery hut”.
we have “wonder toys”, but it sounds like the same thing.
i don’t think toy r us could pick up the collectible crowd with their current theme and giant box store business model.
target, walmart and fred meyer carry almost as much stock but have a lot more to offer shoppers who are mostly going to brick and mortar for groceries.
casual shopping was a casualty of the internet boom and the great recession.
millennials and beyond have big bills (college loans, skyrocketing rent, phone and internet) and tiny paychecks.
they are scared of having kids for a bunch of reasons.
the present and future don’t look good for big box stores focused only on one or two things.
they seem to be looking back where society was, instead of where they need to be.
i feel like they would still be beat by amazon in that.
amazon is just too cheap and my wallet is just too empty.
i buy collectibles and i always feel bad buying them on amazon instead of the local stores.
why buy a $200 + taxes harley quinn dc bombshells statue in my local comic book store if it's available on amazon for $50 less.
&gt;why buy a $200 + taxes harley quinn dc bombshells statue in my local comic book store if it's available on amazon for $50 less.
..... i think i found out why your wallet is too empty, bro... lmao you think walmart is more organized and cleaner then toys r us.
idk where you live but that's way ass backwards from by me while changing their model might have helped, l think toys r us was just another victim of brick-and-mortar vs. online retailers.
why fight crowds and deal with wrangling kids who might latch onto something not planned?
fao schwartz had a closer model to what you described, and they still buckled.
this again?
from the last time this was posted, and the time before that.
thanks to /u/laminar_flo &gt;this is always a hugely controversial area, but its worth understanding the other side of this issue.
'retention bonuses' are extremely common in bankruptcies, and not paying them could make the situation worse and result in a bigger loss for bondholders.
first and most important thing is that toys r us filed ch11/reorganization, not ch7/liquidation.
toys r us will continue to exist.
&gt;when a company declares bk, the first thing that happens is that everybody starts looking for a new job.
secondly, bks are extremely complicated and delicate.
if this goes wrong, then the ch11 could convert to ch7 and then toys r us goes away and everybody loses their jobs including store level employees.
these retention bonuses exist to reward the turnaround team for 1) succeeding in the restructuring, and 2) staying at the company.
again, if your whole management team leaves the company in the middle of a bk, there's nobody to drive the car, and you end up going off the cliff.
&gt;lastly, and very importantly, this money is paid out of the bondholders recovery pool.
in plain english, this money isn't coming from mom &amp; pop investors, and it was never going to the store level associates - the money is coming from hedge funds/banks/pe firms/vulture funds.
they are very sophisticated investors who know what they are getting into and they are also the people that reddit loves to hate edit: permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7dea8y/bankrupt_toys_r_us_wants_to_pay_16_million_in/dpx4g69/?st=javl2c2d&amp;sh=51531f0a yeah but still, fuck this.
having been a vendor on the other end of a bankruptcy where a giant hotel chain worth billions (i'm assuming since the founder himself is worth $1 billion) owed me thousands in overdue invoices, this is hard to swallow.
they fucked over every company who provided services to them in the previous 30-90 days, which the hotels had already made their profits on (food and beverage vendors, audio visual/production companies, etc.).
i don't think it's ok for them to decide not to pay the companies they owe money to, but the executives still line their pockets with bonuses and investors improve their share values.
if you can't afford to keep the doors open, you should close.
nobody deserves to be rewarded for being a part of a failing company when everyone else has to suffer to keep it alive.
in this world, the bondholders and the executives are more important than the grease that keeps the wheels spinning.
i'd like to see the company run with these people stocking the shelves and running the registers.
companies often file for bankruptcy to avoid paying back money they owed.
see: donald trump no thanks.
yeah i’d rather not congratulations!
you just discovered the definition of bankruptcy.
bankruptcy is a necessary and useful tool that capitalism cannot function without lest it risk even greater periodic collapse than we already see.
however, like everything else, it is a completely different type of tool for moneyed interests; for the poor it's a "way out" from unsustainable debts, for the rich its another tool to get more while fucking everyone else over.
can i call bankruptcy and not pay my credit card bills?
and continue on with my life?
maybe get a raise too?
the first two, literally yes.
you'll have bad credit for seven years though, and may be required to sell a bunch of luxuries.
i wonder if this guy actually knows individual bankruptcy exists... um, no.
you have to go to court and prove you can't pay.
also, a chapter 7 stays on for 10 years, and it's what most regular people have to do.
i mean what he said wasn't untrue, just failed to mention the fact that you need to prove you can't pay.
if you can pay, you just have to run them up more on non-tangible items like holidays.
or you can buy lots of small stuff, they only really care about houses and cars.
so if you're a renter, run them up buying toysrus stock on black friday, declare bankruptcy and then sell it all on ebay at full price.
what?!?
the government should be giving me money after removing my debt!
who do you think you are?
a bank or something?
you can (declare bankruptcy), and it will go to a bankruptcy judge who will decide if your bills and debts vs income are sufficient to grant relief under chapter 7 (discharge all or part of debt) or 13 (negotiate/renegotiate a plan with bankruptcy court protections to repay your debt under more favorable terms) from my understanding, perhaps it's a state thing, individuals cannot file chapter 7 anymore.
businesses are allowed to but individuals are required to file chapter 13 where they will have to repay an agreed amount.
its harder to declare chapter 7 now.
but not impossible.
i had to do it after my divorce.
ive purchased a house since, but i still cannot get a credit card or store credit anywhere.
the only card i could get is secured.
generally follows the uniform commercial code which i do recall being amended only a few years back to make chapter 7 harder to meet, [but based on this site it appears to be still available.
]( http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-7-bankruptcy-basics).
i don't think based on reading some news sources it's used as widespread as it once was.
i hate to break it to you but no executive , employee, manager or shareholder wants to go into bk.
they would line their pockets much more if the usiness was succeeding.
we landed on the moon!
as noted above, they filed [chapter 11 bankruptcy](http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-11-bankruptcy-basics), meaning they still have to pay back their debts.
companies don’t “often” do that.
you may be able to find a few examples (trump), but if youre actually trying to continue the business, filing bankruptcy is the last thing you want.
good luck getting any decent lines of credit for the next few years while having to pay for bankruptcy lawyers.
plus, companies just can’t elect to “not pay” and file bankruptcy.
once you file bankruptcy, the process is handled in court, where creditors have the first rights to recoup the money their owed.
no shit dude.
that's exactly what bankruptcy is.
and don't think it's all rainbows and sunflowers, going through bankruptcy as either an individual or a company is not a pretty thing, and it is not just filled willy-nilly.
companies who file chapter 7 or 11 must follow very specific rules.
bingo, which is why this feels so bad.
i get that the money paid here is not from the company but investors for this particular intent, but it's still madness.
sorry that happened to you.
well no money is being paid here yet.
a key part the title left out is these are conditional bonuses that will be paid if the company meets certain financial targets.
they’re basically trying to incentivize the new management to turn the company around.
retention bonuses were already agreed to prior to these new payments.
this is reddit astro-turfing to deflect anger online.
these are holiday incentive bonuses, not the $ millions already agreed to in retention bonuses during initial bankruptcy proceedings.
&gt; if you can't afford to keep the doors open, you should close.
yes, let's kick 65 *thousand* employees to the curb during the holidays because of your feelings on incentive bonuses used to turn companies around, money that doesn't come from the company nor was pay that could go to said employees.
you do understand that toys backwards r us is not 17 highly paid execs and 64,983 people at cash registers, right?
we're talking about a very large company.
if you want to argue that these bonuses are just too high, guess what!
we actually agree.
but to suggest they should not exist, and to then suggest that chapter 11 bankruptcy should not exist, is simply false.
it would make situations much worse, and cost people more money, and cause more unemployment.
this guy economies scenario one: no one qualified to take over is willing to take control.
chapter 11 becomes chapter 7. you get pennies on the dollar if you are lucky.
all stake holders (bondholders, stockholders) also get pennies on the dollar scenario two: you get someone remotely qualified to take over and/or stay on, pay them a bonus to do so.
this company gets a second chance.
you get pennies on the dollar if you are lucky, stakeholders have a shot at getting more, not guaranteed either way you get pennies on the dollar.
yes, it sucks, but unfortunately its the risk of doing business with anyone be it will a billion dollar company or your neighbor.
i'm a bankruptcy lawyer and your comment is actually hinting at a good concept actually in the bankruptcy code -- under the bankruptcy code, you have to prove that stakeholders (creditors and equity) will both receive more under a chapter 11 plan than a chapter 7 liquidation (called the best interests test).
stockholders actually don’t have a right to any money in bankruptcy proceeding.
they do have a right, they are just absolutely last in line, so rarely ever wind up with anything i don’t think you understand that not compensating the people who weather the storm just makes the situation you describe *worse*.
you’re not arguing against bonuses and salary.
not being able to repay debt and filing for protection is exactly what bankruptcy is.
you’re saying no one should be able to file unless they have $0 - that’s not how bankruptcy works in *any* case.
the point of ch 11 is precisely so that the business can reorganize so that in the future, it *can* pay for shit.
if you had your druthers, not only would business be more merciless and unforgiving, but no one would ever have an incentive to actually try to fix a problem.
your solution leads to more unemployment and flies in the face of bankruptcy itself.
with all due respect, this is the risk of business.
i run a business and am always mindful of my clients financial situations and ability to pay invoices.
if my clients can't pay, i can be upset at them, but ultimately it comes down to me to identify and work with reliable, paying partners and clients.
i completely agree with you.
however, you cannot predict that a very large company you have done business with on a daily basis for 8+ years, which has paid every invoice on time, will suddenly stop paying.
being complacent isn't a good defense for not doing continuous due diligence.
just because a company has paid every invoice on time doesn't indicate that they will for eternity.
a good small business owner should be constantly assessing clients.
they say it's to keep talent around for what's to come, but if they messed this up, i don't see their value or need for a bonus.
their probably in this predicament because of poor management, yet we reward it?
i don't know much about the toys r us situation, but i do know they're a retail store chain.
the entire retail industry is getting crushed by amazon.
it's likely that their problems are not entirely self-imposed.
i think that's my biggest problem with it too.
i worked for toys r us years ago.
my managers fucking sucked.
even at the lowest levels it was shit.
then when the corporate guys would come in, everyone went into crisis mode.
did we sell enough "bpp's (buyer protection plans)?"
fuck that.
this business went down for a reason.
its extremely mismanaged.
they sell fucking toys for christ sake.
and while they might not get to pick what they stock on their shelves, you're going to have a hard time convincing me that the demand isn't there.
kids want toys.
that isn't ever going to change.
there isn't a kid alive that doesn't love going to the toy store and seeing all that stuff in person.
i miss the shit out of kb toys, and i'll miss toy's r us too.
but honestly, working at a toy store should be a blast.
instead, it was a total misery.
something is fundamentally wrong with your business model if you can make that work environment suck.
i worked for toy liquidators, kb toys' clearance outlet store, in high school.
it was a fun job while we had a good manager.
we played around and kept the store as neat as you could with little hellions tearing it apart every day.
then a new bitch came in and within about 2 months, everybody had been driven away and it just sucked to work there.
i heard once that “you leave your manager, not your job,” and it definitely resonated for a couple of the jobs i’ve left.
it’s amazing what a change one manager can bring to a workplace.
i know that story.
i've had a few bad managers at wal-mart.
it's surprising how everything is somehow magically better when they disappear even if you couldn't put your finger on exactly what it is that changed.
am in talent development.. this and "its easier to change people than it is to *change* people" are common sayings.. it's always someone else's fault.
it's true to some degree.
loved my last manager but was getting bored/concerned that i would continue doing the same work regardless of how senior or principle my title became.
changed jobs, new manager was a shit show and within 6 months i started putting out feelers to get my old job back (which paid around 12% less i might add), but no luck there.
i left when they had a hiring freeze.
luckily my new company sacked a ton of people including my supervisor.
now my newest supervisor seems like the right kind of person again (still feeling it out until more time has passed).
anyway point is i agree.
i regret leaving a job with a manager that i liked and considered a mentor.
manager at new job had me ready to leave almost immediately.
they were fired and replaced; seems like i might be willing to stick around now.
i miss kb too.
after they folded there was no legit toy store that you could find in shopping malls.
fao shwartz they still exist?
this ceo wasn't there years ago.
he was hired in 2015 to minimize the crash after they fucked up all the things you mentioned.
disagree the demand is still what it used to be.
with the introduction of high end video games, demand for physical toys is nowhere near what it used to be.
i think the biggest problem for brick and mortar stores is online buying.
we all know the advantage of online buying.
and there is a huge financial benefit to online selling.
so the brick store compete heavily with the easy option.
but the company doesn’t want to give up and close all stores.
so they resort to selling credit cards.
brick stores make more money selling their credit cards than their products.
their products are likely priced close to what they are priced online to keep people in stores rather than buy online.
this ultimately fails bc people are very conscious about credit.
every brick store will be gone soon except stores like walmart and clothing stores.
they be around for a while bc both are a quick one shop stop for many things you need now.
clothing stores bc you don’t want to deal with buying clothing online and it not fitting.
they still ask about the bpps (now it's square trades, though) along with tru credit cards, loyalty cards and batteries!
and, no kids don't want toys anymore.
they don't have time to play with toys in between eating, sleeping and watching (and sometimes interacting with) the various screens their parents buy them.
(i had a couple ask them what **tablet** would be right for their seven month old, for god's sake!)
source: guess where i work?
i'm going to guess wal-mart because i work there and i've had similar questions, though thankfully for children whose ages are measured in years instead of months.
kids who haven't even entered grade school yet very definitely do not need a tablet.
fao shwartz...?
thats because toys are neutered versions of what they were.
toys have been stripped down to the bare minimum of manufacturing.
the only manufacturer that this is not true for is lego.
every other toy brand now builds cheap shitty versions of toys that used to last for decades that you are lucky if they last a few weeks.
the bonuses are only paid if certain financial targets are met next year.
the management aren’t the same people as those responsible for bankrupting the company (and if they are and continue to do a poor job, they won’t get paid).
the people being paid aren't the people who messed it up.
they've [the ones who messed up toys r us] gone to spend more time with their families.
i would imagine it's an inherited mess.
that's where clawback provisions in executive compensation plans come into play.
they prevent incompetent and crooked executives from profitting off mismanagement and bankruptcy.
&gt; their probably in this predicament because of poor management i assure you *they’re* probably not.
a company failing is almost never the fault of any one person or even several specific people.
in this case, i would say it had to do with shifting markets and toys r us taking too long to respond and adapt.
that doesn’t mean the cfo, the controller, accounting executives, hr managers, etc.
did anything wrong or couldn’t provide value to other companies.
executive bonuses actually make up a majority of pay, and depending on the company, 16 million is relatively small.
however i agree that ceo pay should reflect how a business is doing, if they're doing shit they make shit.
being paid by stock share seems to work a bit better for this, but still leads to working more for the stockholders and board members.
very few are willing to pull a costco, in fact it looks like their new ceo is taking a pay increase but will still be within the 1 million mark.
hell being a mid level manager is stressful enough but i'd probably only be a major ceo for half a million if i know the business is doing well, and i have flexibility to do things my way instead of pushing bs plans or every metric imaginable.
the corporate life is soul crushing, it takes a certain type of individual.
i don't think toys r us did any one thing to fail though, they're simply among the victims of online shopping and transitioning into...whatever the hell we're headed toward.
they kept stores open, lights on, and employees paid so what could you possibly hold against them?
it's not like they committed some atrocity against consumers and the public by trying to run their business.
ok, i get this, and the overall argument.
but as a redditor who loves to hate, i still am hating on these execs who are collecting money dramatically in excess of what i will spend in my entire lifetime, for leading a company through a bankruptcy process that ultimately allows them to default on large swaths of debt.
it's great that "mom &amp; pop" investment capital is not used, and that these "vulture capitalists" pay these bonuses instead, but it increasingly strikes me as a shell game for the 1% (ultra-rich, executive class, whatever you want to call them) to pass [effectively] unlimited amounts of money from crony to crony.
it looks crooked.
it smells crooked.
it feels crooked.
now, it is, or it isn't.
but i think we all know, on some level, that it most definitely is.
the number of people that can successfully lead a multi-billion dollar company through bankruptcy and place the company on the path to recovery is incredibly small.
you could argue how much they "deserve", but getting a bonus certainly isn't crooked.
the better argument is the "golden parachute", where executives are paid out millions when they completely fail and fuck up a company.
&gt;the number of people that can successfully lead a multi-billion dollar company through bankruptcy and place the company on the path to recovery is incredibly small.
while that sounds plausible, it sounds much more like what these executives would like me to believe.
and when you consider that the men and women in this executive class are cut from the same cloth and made of the same stuff as you and me, and are in no way guaranteed to be the smartest, most skilled and savvy people on the planet, i think lots of these executive compensation packages is a formal gilding scam being run by the rich on the rest of us.
the panama papers scandal points to trillions of dollars that these ultra-rich have simply removed from the global economy and parked in tax havens for their children's children's grandchildren; or for buying influence; or for protecting and insulating themselves from the legal consequences of criminal activity.
and yet, there's still no shortage of people saying that these people actually deserve these ludicrous amounts of money.
i'm not buying it.
they're running an elaborate game on us.
you’re not paying a doctor to give you drugs.
any schmo could walk down to the pharmacy, grab some pills, and tell you to go nuts.
you’re paying the doctor to know which pill to get for you.
the doctor and i took the same classes in undergrad, hell mine might even have been tougher, but he’ll get paid way more than me because he learned more past that and, critically, has very special experience to back it up.
you don’t think that their special experience is worth $16mm?
that’s fine, don’t pay your retention teams that much.
but this $16mm isn’t yours, and the people who it does belong to think it’ll save them money in the long run.
if they’re wrong, they will be the ones who get burned when the whole thing falls apart.
there’s a lot of sketchy things that go on in the finance world, where public funds end up covering private risk.
but this isn’t that.
this is a pool of stakeholders making a decision that they think will salvage as much as possible from what turned out to be a bad investment.
what evidence do you have that they’re cut from the same cloth.
if you could do that job wouldn’t you be doing it?
they, much like lebron or jordan, have a skill you don't have that produces $$$ you can't produce.
that's why they get paid more than you do.
don't be salty about basic economics.
one thing you're failing to account for is the compensation that these executives could collect at another company.
whether we'd like to admit it or not, they have a skill - or a least the ability to sell a skill - that few people have.
companies are currently desperate for talent and the market is prime for these execs to find another job paying similar compensation - all at what is considered "market compensation" for their job and skillset.
toys "r" us paying market rate or above market rate to encourage ranking executives to stay with the company through an extremely risk time is a great move.
if your company filed for bankruptcy and you could find another job with competitive pay, back by a company not in bankruptcy, would you stay at the bankrupt company or take the other job?
i think the better argument is if you do successfully pull out of a bankruptcy and make the company profitable again, you should absolutely be rewarded with an appropriate bonus.
you should not be paying out large bonuses simply for trying.
this isn’t kindergarten.
i think there is nothing appropriate about this at all.
it's a little less dramatic than that.
yes, these people are all overpaid, but they're by and large independent actors with long careers, not "cronies" (although that is sometimes the case).
they aren't conspiring with the "vulture capitalists," rather they are on the other side of the table trying to get the best deal they can for themselves (the investors would like to pay them the smallest amount possible without losing them at the company).
the real underlying problem is that executives in general are massively overpaid in the first place, so it costs enormous sums of money to keep the "talent" at the company.
this environment is the product of years of upward pay ratcheting thanks to compensation consultants (who are essentially paid by the ceos to recommend higher pay for the ceos), less-than-attentive boards/governance, and oftentimes too much executive influence/control over their own pay, which taken together creates an environment where pay is constantly increasing out of line with the rest of the economy.
you can also point at the lack of reinvestment in recent years, as a result of which corporations develop larger and larger cash hoards that they use for buy-backs, dividends, or exec comp rather than real capital expenditures for the future.
also, 16 million is nothing compared to the kind of money companies that large rake in normally.
the one thing missing though is that this company was bought out by firms like kkr and bain capital.
they make their money back buy charging these companies fees of which they took over half a billion from.
still not going to completely cover their losses but these companies are shit.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2017/09/25/bankrupt-toys-r-us-was-crippled-by-bain-kkr-debt.amp.html i got hired at bru hq in nj about 2 years ago.
2 months in they restructured and i lost my job.
it was such a depressing moment, it was a dream job for me in a dream company, the campus was great and i was really excited to work there.
i had been a tru fan since i was a kid (obviously) and i had a lot of love lost for tru since then because they stuck with the "family friendly" attitude and refused to sell m games, so i didn't shop tru for games anymore.
their "business plan" ensured they'd lose me as a customer.
worse yet, their pipeline / infrastructure for deliveries could have absolutely destroyed gamestop / amazon had they had they adopted the internet instead of worrying it would cannibalize their sales.
they *could have been the biggest company in toys / games but chose not to*.
i was really excited to start working there, i had that little dream that i could maybe be one of those people where my coworkers say "he really helped this company".
oh well.
&gt; the one thing missing though is that this company was bought out by firms like kkr and bain capital.
true.. but kkr and bain aren't complete vampires.
they're usually hired by the executive board to arrive at _exactly_ the situation in the headline.
they raided the company and they're still getting their bonuses.. because they hired the best company in the business to get it done for them.
it's less goodfellas and more gordon gekko.
i hope it’s a really fancy jelly of the month club [deleted] ignorance, on *my* reddit?
i don’t have a problem with this.
then again, i don’t think i really get it.
these are incentive bonuses yes?
paid to the top 17 executives if their financial goals are met this holiday season.
why are people taking issue with that?
please don’t flame me lol, i’m very ignorant on issues like this just trying to better understand.
and 16 million to 17 people is not ridiculous.
that's kind of a reasonable reward for saving a failing company.
you're looking at the facts logically, not emotionally.
if my previous experience of working there is any indication of the future, they will never hit that mark.
i worked during the holidays as a seasonal worker last christmas, and we were apparently the largest toys r us within a few states.
we lost money almost everyday in december, nobody came in besides on black friday.
everyday there were 200, 300, sometimes even 400 ship from store orders to fill.
people don't want to drive to the store and deal with any hassle in getting what they want when it's so easy to click a few buttons on your computer to obtain it.
you're delusional if you think they'll make it through this restructuring without paying incentive bonuses.
bonuses are for closers only.
what i don't understand is why the market values these kinds of deals.
can you not found people who will accept being execs and not be subject to an enormous bonus/payout?
when is reddit going to grow the fuck up, stop being childish and learn how the world works?
they are executives.
of a giant company.
and they get like 1 million in bonuses, each.
what seems to be so hard to understand?
the first question really is, "what does the $16 million mean to creditors?
is it 50% or 0.005%?"
once that fact is known, it might be a "who cares" if the significance is tiny.
but once the amount of the retention bonus starts looking like big money, the more the bankruptcy process needs to listen to the choice of the creditors.
they may want the money for themselves or are content with paying the bonuses to hope for greater success and a share in a later recovery from ongoing operations.
or creditors could want a mix of options.
i mean, the creditors had to approve the chapter 11 plan, and the court has to approve anything outside of normal business expenses, so the safeguards guaranteeing creditor input are there.
this clickbait was posted here a week or two ago and the top comment gave a rational explanation then too.
but the people who upvote the headline without engaging the article or the discussion will go on perpetuating their ignorance.
yay yay!
trickle down, right guys?
i can't wait to get a taste!
people that do not receive bonuses as part of their pay, tend to hear the word bonus as "extra or unwarranted pay".
that is a misnomer.
i work in an industry where i am guaranteed bonuses, the amount differs, but that is part of my earnings.
yeah when did bonus stop meaning 'something extra you get for doing an especially good job' and start meaning 'a normal part of expected compensation that's different from regular wages probably for dodgy tax purposes'?
i dont remember hearing about the change over.
the main reason is to ensure these executives don't jump ship and let the company tank.
company tanks and everyone loses their jobs.
allowing an incentive for execs to stay is an attempt to keep the ship floating.
if you're poor and you fail, it's all your fault.
if you're rich and you fail, it's everybody else's fault.
innocent until proven poor.
they only get the bonuses if the company hits financial targets who is saying that?
i support chapter 11 because it saves people's jobs and i support public assistance for those who need it.
quit trying to pretend this is a dichotomy.
you are comparing apples and oranges.
what does that have to do with this?
this [partially explains why toys "r" us went bankrupt after a leveraged buyout by bain capital](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/why-private-equity-firms-like-bain-really-are-the-worst-of-capitalism-20120523) sixteen million reason to not shop there as they stiff their suppliers, screw their employees.
i get that they need the best execs to save their ship but is the ship even worth saving..probably not.
same execs failed to right this ship for years paying out bonuses is a contractual obligation for large companies.
its the right thing to do.
should those same bonuses be contracted for next year, then the shareholders should take issue with it, and i guess the rest of us can care if we want, but there's nothing wrong with paying their obligations this year.
by definition, a bankrupt company is probably going to fail to make some contractually obligated payments.
some suppliers may have already delivered toys and need cash for their own emplyees etc.
its up to the bankruptcy court to decide which ones toys r us should pay.
problem with that logic is that bankruptcy proceedings allow companies to get out of some of their contractual obligations (e.g.
not pay or only partly pay creditors and suppliers).
sooooo you're at the helm of a company who is doing so shitty it needs to file chapter 11, and you're marketable enough to go get another equal paying job?
i understand the bonuses to keep the ones already there to make the bankruptcy smoother, but then again i don't know enough of these execs job history (how long have they been with toys r us etc) to have a qualified opinion on the matter.
the person running it now is most likely not the one who got it there - most companies bring in new execs to try to fix things if theyre doing restructuring.
running a company is not easy - it's not always successful it's easy to sit back and criticize headlines but realize that people don't run companies to make them bankrupt sounds about right for dave brandon.
right?
i hate dave brandon with all my heart.
this is obviously the michigan alumni section of the comments.
hiiii!!
*waves* i understand all of the arguments being made in favor of this, but if i am a small business owner with, say, a contract to clean a few toys 'r us stores in my town after hours, and they file bankruptcy and leave me with a few thousand in invoices that won't be paid, i'ma get a little touchy when i read about a few people who couldn't right the ship getting a million each before the inevitable sinking.
didn't we have someone in an askreddit thread warn of this exact thing like a week ago?
it was like a few days ago iirc, i guess someone took that seriously as they should.
that was yesterday; and they were talking about all data (due to software).
according to the article, this breach was due to someone gaining access to email accounts that had pii *and phi* in them.
sending phi via email... that's like what not to do when you work with phi 101 true.
also, thanks for the reminder that it was both pii and phi.
maybe he is the one that casued it to happen haha if only we had someone that was really great with the cyber to deter these attacks!
hfhs employee here - most of upper management in it right now have extremely puckered buttholes, and rightly so.
how's your butthole doing?
loose as a goose.
it doesn't affect me much at all, i'm just a low-level it lackey.
what ehr system are you using?
epic.
we spent over half of a billion dollars revamping our system to become compliant with the aca.
before that, we were using care plus next generation.
as a cyber security professional who has made many many attempts at trying to connect with your executive team regarding this exact issue.. i am not sure what to say.
it really does not talk about the scope.
they have henry ford hospitals in multiple areas.
my hometown hospital just became part of them last year or maybe the year before that.
well its a ford.
what did you expect.
renewables are causing disruption in the energy sector.
ge, more positioned in fossil fuel power, is divesting, as is siemens.
we're in the middle of the tipping point toward renewable energy sources.
whether you think it's good or bad, it is happening.
siemens just spun off half their wind stake to gamesa last year.
they have been firing a bunch of people in the wind division.
the wind plant in kansas is basically non existent right now.
the power industry as a whole is slow.
yea, siemens recently closed down a factory that made wind turbine parts in ontario, ca.
yet, some in the media painted their job cuts announcement as a sign of fossil fuels waning.
people need to realize that these multi-national conglomerates are buying into (and out of) different industries every year.
every so often they have to consolidate their operations or lessen their risk if one sector gets soft.
for example, many of these cuts that ge announced are happening in switzerland, where they recently made huge acquisitions in the past few years.
in ontario the plant only existed because of government subsidies, ontario has a surplus of power so it cut the subsidy, and they closed the plant.
in na at least, most of the plants are operating because of large subsidies to this point.
thanks.
i looked that up.
siemens is also moving away from gas.
the article states that a driving force is the renewables market.
volatility in energy right now.
disruption.
&gt;ge, more positioned in fossil fuel power, is divesting, as is siemens.
ge bought baker hughes a while back, how is that divesting?
so it's now the hip thing to blame renewable energy instead of automation?
i'm so behind on the times.
i've worked in that building!
it's a shame that ge was allowed to purchased alstom/abb and now are just going to shut them down.
at least they were forced to sell off some of the alstom business units by anti-trust regulators.
&gt;it's a shame that ge was allowed to purchased alstom/abb and now are just going to shut them down.
huh?
[they just sold their industrial solutions business *to* abb.
](http://fortune.com/2017/09/25/ge-industrial-solutions-abb-sale/) that's a different business.
alstom and abb are both still around as separate entities.
but the gas turbine division of abb was purchased by alstom many years ago, and recently that same business was purchased by ge, and these are the offices that they are now closing.
caterpillar laid off thousands right before a recession too.
ge has a reputation as a good, smart company.
why didn’t they get ahead of alternative power?
it’s been known to be the only option for the future, for decades.
that's what's happening.
not all of the skill sets are going to directly transfer.
ge has been struggling for many years.
they were heavily invested in the financial sector going into the century, which they managed to mostly divest from, but there are a lot of painful decisions to make before it turns around.
the stock has lost about 45% of it's value over the last year.
https://www.economist.com/news/business/21722663-amid-whirlwind-dealmaking-ges-returns-lag-jeff-immelts-record-shows-pitfalls https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-06-12/jeff-immelt-successor-at-ge-will-have-to-finish-what-he-started https://hbr.org/2017/10/why-ges-jeff-immelt-lost-his-job-disruption-and-activist-investors imo they should have never broken apart and sold ge capital.
although the margins weren’t as good as their industrial side it was a good cash cow for them and accounted for 40-60% of their revenue, even in the recession.
again big companies making short term decisions to appease stock holders.
interestingly enough, from jack welch: "on the face of it, shareholder value is the dumbest idea in the world," welch said, "shareholder value is a result, not a strategy…your main constituencies are your employees, your customers and your products."
jack welch is full of shit, nothing new.
they also own nbc which is kinda interesting given how many people on tv were shilling for the bailout they where working on generators for wind turbines in the middle 90s.
i was at ge transportation during that time.
locomotive traction motors and alternators make really good turbine generators.
iirc, it was really slow, as a business, then.
but i haven't worked for ge since around ~2000.
thats hardly a universally held opinion.
they purchased a major competitor in the gas and steam turbine sector (alstom) out of bankruptcy and are now going to shut them down.
it wouldn't surprise me if this was their plan all along.
thankfully, they were forced to sell off major portions of alstom and subsidiaries by anti-trust regulators.
&gt; ge has a reputation as a good, smart company.
ge is known to not pay their share in taxes yet they gain the most with these tax cuts.
but, but... corporations were supposed to be creating jobs with all their new tax cuts!!
well, they purchased an overseas competitor and are now essentially shutting them down.
presumably this will strengthen their original us based power business with heavy presence in new york and south carolina.
although they've already been having layoffs in the us business this year.
alstom was non-profitable prior to the ge purchase and needed yet another state bail out from france.
france was not going to provide that bailout due to economic issues within the country.
alstom was going to be purchased by someone, be it ge, siemens, mhi, etc.
whomever ended up with alstom was going to make cuts in duplicated employees and other areas where cost could be cut.
https://tradingeconomics.com/alo:fp:net-profit-margin * they were bailed out in 2003 * they showed negative margin in 2014, higher than in 2003 siemens just got done with a massive layoff as well (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-siemens-power-restructuring/siemens-to-cut-6900-jobs-to-tackle-flailing-turbines-business-iduskbn1dg257) that was announced in mid-november.
the number for ge is based on them finally consolidating from the alstom acquisition and the down turn in the fossil power market.
if siemens had purchased alstom, they would have the big number and ge would have the small number.
at least wait for the tax cuts.
and here we have trickle down economics, folks.
give billion dollar corporation massive tax breaks to "grow the economy" and they cut 12,000 jobs.
yes, the just passed tax bill instantaneously went into effect already!
ge has always got these breaks.
this is not new.
the amount of breaks is higher but corporations claiming to "grow our economy" with those breaks is consistent.
ford motor company is moving to mexico.
this is what the american people get in return for those breaks.
get off'n it.
reverse the parties and you'd be doing the same fucking thing.
fact we have historical evidence (reaganomics, fucking kansas) that trickle down is a terrible terrible idea that does not work.
if we start seeing massive layoffs coming up, its because corporations are aware of this and are gearing up to weather it out yet again.
another case of someone projecting their judgements and views onto others when they have no idea what the person on the receiving end is going through.
wasn't a sheriff caught recently using dead people's handicap stickers?
i believe that when violations are committed by people in power flagrantly and often, then the crazies in society see themselves as vigilantes and try to police everyone (or alternatively, crazies are committing the violations themselves because they perceive that people in power do it without punishment) call-out culture and public shaming is one of the worst things in existence right now.
one could argue that it's a good thing, considering all of the sexual harassment scandals coming to light with the perpetrators being called out and shamed another example of assuming first and questioning those assumptions never.
a real shame.
there is a freaking handicap tag in the car.
what a jackass.
someone using virtue signaling as a cover for envy?
i've gotten called out for bringing in riding carts from the lot at walmart.
people just want to be mad.
people are so shitty.
call-out culture and generation offended are the biggest hypocrites in the past 200 years.
be careful of singling out specific generations or their call-out culture if you don't want to hear about the nasty self-righteous shit your own generation did.
i'm technically a millennial myself and i can't stand people in my own generation with their virtue signalling and hypocritical facebook activism.
people in my generation don't really self reflect, introspect or think critically about their surroundings.
same here.
nothing worse than the self-congratulatory post when a vapid snowflake doesn't support something and *just wants you to know* that they oppose it on social media.
"i just wanted to take a moment to thank everybody who stands with me in opposing[*insert politician or issue here*].
it's vile that we are subjected to a society where [*stupid issue*] is afflicted upon citizens.
perhaps one day we will move past it, but i just do not see how!
#[*stupid fucking slogan*]" the passive aggressive pearl clutching has reached a fever pitch, and i am beginning to endorse the idea of trying to start a satirical movement to finding the world's *least* privileged person so that whenever a decision on *any* level must be made, we can just go to that person to get their input first, to avoid any potential insensitivity or offense.
sad part is i'm pretty sure that this movement would take off.
gofundme here i come!
/s never have i witness such abject human indecency as when i have to park at kop around christmas.
makes me sick.
i'm a not viability disabled person and i always am a little afraid people will question or shame me for parking where i need to.
people like this are part of what makes people ashamed and afraid to use the resources provided for those in need.
&gt; data was frozen on dozens of mecklenburg county servers after one of its employees opened an email attachment carrying malicious software earlier this week.
we have it security courses at my job that basically say "don't fucking open emails that you don't recognize and especially don't open the attachments."
glad to see they were able to fall back on non-digital stuff to keep processes running, albeit at a slower pace.
i work for an msp, you can literally have the training session and five minutes later you have people emailing you that they accidentally opened something and put in all of their creds.
people just are not smart, it's pretty frustrating to see in day to day.
in fact, in dealing with this this morning with one of our smaller clients who did the same, luckily it appears to be a trojan and a simple wipe and reload will fix.
but still, people are fucking dumb as nails and so nonchalant about it.
i always see people saying oh how can this happen when a data breach goes down.
if you work in it you know exactly how it can go down, it's like herding fucking cats dealing with users.
there needs to be some sort of stepped punishment of sorts for this sort of thing.
if the user does it once, okay, innocent mistake.
but let them know if they do it a second time, their supervisor will be notified.
then if they do it a second time, notify their supervisor that they seem to have a problem with security routines and/or computer skills and need more training.
if there's no ramifications for being willfully carefree with company equipment, they'll continue to abuse this privilege.
i don't see it as deliberate, but when you know the computer isn't yours, you don't give as much of a fuck as you would if it were your shit at risk.
in theory i agree, but the reality is that you will have users who will be afraid to report it issues because they'll be worried that the problem they're noticing is their fault.
and that's not a good situation either.
organizations need to invest in their networks.
pay for an msp who regularly monitors your networks, rolls out updates and notifies you if your systems are becoming obsolete.
if you have an internal it team, give them a budget for network upgrades and regular training.
not that i don't think that you should be fired for misusing company equipment.
if you're using your company computer to browse pornhub, you absolutely deserve to lose your job.
but making your users live in paralyzing fear of making a mistake isn't a good solution either.
true, and i was always very lenient about such things as i knew my users pretty well after a few years.
the last thing i ever wanted was to make my users afraid of reporting issues; sometimes that's inevitable because they think we're "too busy".
i'd always tell them i'd rather take 5 minutes to check their computer now as opposed to 5 hours restoring it later.
but there are some users who get trained ten ways to sunday, all different methodologies for user education down to sitting next to them and talking in as plainspeak as possible, who *still* click that link or open that attachment.
those are the users who need some sort of understanding of consequences that go beyond inconveniencing it.
sadly, in my experience, those same users are also the same people in the organization who would be in charge of disciplinary action against a careless employee :( &gt;it's like herding fucking cats dealing with users.
this sums up working in it.
&gt; people are fucking dumb as nails and so nonchalant about it.
like it's a cute personality trait to be an idiot.
"oh did i do that?
sorry, i'm just such an idiot sometimes.
", they say before trotting off to grab another mocha latte or some shit.
"i'm just not computer literate" shrug and that boy's is called job security, welcome to it *!
* it was adorable when urkel said it because he didn't fuck the company's servers up!
sir, i am not a computer person and you are refusing to help me.
&gt; if you work in it you know exactly how it can go down, it's like herding fucking cats dealing with users.
i work it in meck county, can confirm.
one person at one client has been phished about 6 or 7 times from opening random emails that say "log in with your account", so they enter their account info and *heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy* here's some fresh "login to download secure files from www.stealyogal.garbo/totallylegit/index.dropbox.fart" emails from their account.
...thankfully i don't work for the county though so i'm not gonna get hit by this shitstorm.
i feel for the it guys over there, they're getting the brunt of this shit.
though i do have to question just how in the hell 48 different servers were hit.
technically all it takes is one unpatched server to get hit with eternalblue and boom, gpos infecting every other server and pc on the domain.
while true, it's the fact that it's government servers going unpatched and unprotected that's disheartening to me.
former msp owner, can confirm.
the one big vacation i took i woke up the first morning to email and phone calls from an employee who infected their machine.
they managed to disable the managed anti-virus so they could "download music" on their office machine.
got to sit on the balcony with 2 laptops and a tablet restoring backups as i watched my family play on the beach.
i support the idea of doing something similar to pet shaming with stupid people like this.
unfortunately everyone gets all up in arms about "oh!
this is hazing!"
it isn't hazing, but you also don't want to alienate your userbase or they won't come to you when they do have a problem.
don't treat users with condescension and especially do not publicly shame them.
try to educate them, on their level if the usual techniques are not working, so you have fewer problems in the future.
perhaps an iq test should be part of the hiring process?
telecom engineer chiming in but i really hope a sys admin can join the discussion here.
what kind of piss poor deployment/security do they have where a user can open an attachment and infect the server and not just their own machine?
that is just spectacularly bad.
hell, i spend half of my day locking down sbcs in a fashion so no one person can exhaust all the resources or cause an outage.
it has to be the same for sys admins.
if the user has mapped drives to a fileserver, it can start working its way through the server files (that they have access to -- critical point -- proper procedure would be to limit their access to only that which they truly need access to do their jobs).
that's just one avenue.
i haven't read the article carefully but i noticed upon skimming that they have *500 servers*, 49 of which were apparently affected.
maintained by a local in-house group or outsourced?
do they really need 500 servers?
i get that it's a big county, i'm just curious as to why they haven't streamlined that a bit.
&gt; what kind of piss poor deployment/security do they have where a user can open an attachment and infect the server and not just their own machine?
speculating here but probably just a plain vanilla shared folder.
most of these viruses use windows smb.
we've sent i don't know how many emails saying this.
it doesn't work.
i work helpdesk at a community college in nc.
every level of employee is guilty of this stuff too.
i don't understand how opening an email and not opening attachments can harmful your computer, isn't that just plain text at that point?
rather certain you are correct but i've heard stories where unprotected email servers can be hit by just opening an email.
that's less of the user's fault though.
that is because people use outlook.
it shouldn't be an issue today, and realistically most people cannot avoid opening emails as part of their job.
embedded html in outlook emails causes problems, but yes, it's business/mission-critical, so it's unavoidable.
this is why education is so important.
depending on your mail client, opening an html-formatted email might execute scripts and/or hit external sites for images/etc.
some of those could exploit vulnerabilities in the email client.
some businesses will even send out fake phishing emails to their own employees to see if they'll fall for it, and if they do, they get some mandatory training and probably a write up.
they do that where i work every year or two.
no one gets in trouble, but they make you take an online course.
they get a lot of people, but all it takes to fail is just opening the email even if you don't click any links or anything.
it's hard to get people not to just reflexively click on new emails.
okay, but what about the ones who come from known addresses?
i teach.
i got one of these from an email address i had corresponded to for two years (taught two of three kids).
i knew the address.
i didn’t click it because i was teaching.
but i will admit, i wondered if she was reaching out for a recommendation or something.
it came up while i taught and in the two hours it took to get back to my machine, it had been flagged (not before three other teachers opened it).
make the statements about people being dumb all you want.
some of us are in jobs where we have to deal with the public and all their real and digital viruses.
your it department should limit the size of the attachments going in and out or just not allow attachments from external sources.
they should also block attachments based on file extensions.
another good idea is to only allow plain text emails.
there are several other steps that could be done but these are very easy and very basic.
can emails themselves even be malicious?
i feel like an attachment has to be open.
and i don't know who would do that a lot of my it work involves security as i do a lot of document/workflow automation and management solutions.
most companies and organizations save for federal/military do not want to spend a dime or can't on security measures.
it's really pathetic how badly we are vulnerable across the country.
don't want to spend a dime, or can't, or don't want their staff to take the time to do things right -- that's another one.
this shit used to keep me up at night panicking about how i'd handle it, knowing how vulnerable our systems were, but there wasn't anything i could do about it without resources and buy-in from upper management.
even if we could break the myth that passwords like "23fjh%kd(@" are somehow more secure then "doughnutbastardstinkpotrhino" we'd be better off, people can't even seem to understand that with this: https://xkcd.com/936/ i honestly give up, i won't do it security as a primary job because i sure as hell am not going to be the guy who gets destroyed when shit does go down.
being in it security means you know exactly what the risks are and how to communicate them, but that doesn't mean anyone up on high is listening or gives a shit.
and it also means you're first in the firing line.
"why didn't you tell us about this vulnerability?"
this is where practicing good cya can at least give you some measure of satisfaction... as you're shown the door anyway because you work in an at-will state.
/sigh oh yep, luckily in my role now you'd have to be a complete idiot to get yourself in trouble.
anything security related or anything that could remotely be an issue as far as vulnerability i simply refer them to their general it.
had a customer from a very old, very big life insurance company more or less demand i set up a ftp server so he can scan in documents (couldn't use smb due to device only supporting tls 1.0).
"yea.. no, that's never going to happen.
you'll have to ask your it department to do that".
he knew enough to know the machine can use ftp but didn't know enough to get it working :) i really like being specialized in a few niche areas and doing just that.
general it management is a nightmare.
&gt;general it management is a nightmare.
i just got out of it and am debating what to do next.
thanks for crystallizing why i feel such a sense of relief!
password hardness is a red herring.
for the enormous majority of people, the only thing that really matters is not reusing passwords.
whether your password has n bits of entropy or 2n is meaningless.
if they have backups what's the issue?
ransomware can be an inconvenience and you may lose a days work but this isn't a new thing anymore.
not having a proper backup system in place is just baffling at this point from soho to a government office of this size.
this is totally believable though.
far to often the individuals charged with making financial decisions choose not to invest in basic it security and best practices.
it's rampant now to hear of the attitude that "the it department doesn't even do anything.
nothing is ever broken."
exactly, if nothing is broken that means your it staff are doing an excellent job.
but instead organizations will downsize or outsource or cut corners.
the reality always sets in when something like this happens and that backup solution and the manpower to properly maintain it doesn't seem so bad when you're paying a ransom on top of the labor involved with standing the network back up and entering all the data that's been gathered on paper instead of digitally for an extended period.
sadly, much like the larger situation with equifax it will be the same it people struggling to maintain order that become the scapegoat.
(unless of course it was just a lazy administrator, in which case it's deserved.)
&gt;if they have backups what's the issue?
i suspect they either don't have backups or they don't routinely do test restores and they got a nice surprise when they tried to restore the data.
that was exactly my thought.
could just be pr saying they have a backup to not look incompetent.
or something i saw dozens of times in my past job was "well there's a usb hard drive/nas/something hooked up in there but we haven't checked in \*insert ridiculous amount of time*."
that's the thing i can't emphasize enough.
you should always have backups and you should always do test restores on a routine basis.
i promise if you don't, it will bite you in the ass.
that's why i'm always still somewhat shocked when i keep seeing these massive failures of best practices in large scale and crucial environments.
a person like me that is by no means a c level or an information security expert or even working in the enterprise space follows these basic procedures.
how is it not happening in these networks and more importantly who is actually to blame?
maybe i'm giving too much credit to the skill level of the individuals tasked with maintaining the integrity of this data but it's not bleeding edge tech.
backup procedures were crucial long before ransomware became a major threat and in my years in it it's always been one of the most overlooked tasks.
i think a lot of the problem ties into one of your other comments about how it is viewed.
they don't want to pay for good people.
they don't want to pay for an adequate number of staff, so things like this unfortunately get bypassed so the little staff they have can react to whomever is screaming the loudest about their current project.
these will be the same places that will look to find a single tech to blame when things like this happen.
it's typically not a tech problem, it's a procedural and management problem.
you're spot on.
i've been doing this for a while now and a lot of this is well known in it circles but somehow hasn't spread to management types.
in a lot it if you want a raise you find a new job.
you find a job that pays you market value and you move until you get the dollar to stress ratio you're looking for.
when you leave you're offered a higher salary after being told that wasn't possible, then your replacement is paid a higher salary because the business has to pay market value to replace someone.
it's a really stupid system but even here in the midwest i see it all the time and have been told it's similar across the us.
the same applies in management regarding it.
you see it with large vendors.
a new ceo or cfo comes in, says too much is spent on support, outsources to india, money is saved and over time sales suffer causing a net loss and and a new ceo comes in and reverses the idea, rinse and repeat.
i did a few years work in msp and sales so i've seen first hand over and over and over the attitude that technology and data are inconveniences and not assets.
the most specific case being ransomware.
i warned a client over and over they should at least invest in some usb hard drives to rotate and backup their one file server.
rougly $400 bucks for a weeks worth of drives to rotate.
wasn't worth it they said.
then ransomware hits and the labor alone to piece things back together from the salvageable data was four times the cost of the drives, not to mention the staff labor to reenter all the lost data.
in the beginning it was insanely frustrating but eventually it comes down to the whole lead a horse to water thing.
it's not just the midwest.
i live in the southeast and the salary system is very much the same.
that being said, i've been fortunate enough to have been working for a credit union the last couple of years that has had some members of the management team start to realize the importance of it.
it's been an interesting culture shift and odd watching those that see the value of it clash with those with that older, legacy, mentality.
i think every year more companies realize that you get what you pay for and that proper resources are needed in it no matter what your business is.
it's just going to be a very slow moving change.
&gt; if they have backups what's the issue?
as others have mentioned, backups may not have been working correctly.
another possibility is the backups were also encrypted.
ransomware has become very targeted - it's not always a 'drive-by' but often times an actor will spend days or weeks inside the network orchestrating the attack.
they will specifically look for the backup system and make sure that is encrypted as well.
i've seen them encrypted the local backup repo and find the off site replica and hit that too as their final steps.
with so many people not bothering with tape backups anymore, it's much easier to 'destroy' backups as well.
at the very least, the admin shares on your backup servers should be disabled.
keep in mind 'government' - especially local government - does not have an endless pile of money to keep up with the latest and greatest or even 'best practices' and they're usually trying to convince very old-school elected officials to loosen the purse strings to let them put proper dr and security measures in place.
e: “i am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,” said diorio.
-- so they are going to restore from backup, that just takes awhile.
i agree that ransomware has wisely been evolved to deal with backups being the easiest means of recovery.
but i disagree that it should be a problem to use some sort of rotating or secured backup procedure.
storage is dirt cheap anymore and with basic measures you can safely backup business critical data in some form or another.
you're also definitely correct that it's very possible the it staff were butting heads with the people in charge of budgets in regards to having a proper backup solution.
i'm personally biased on the situation but i see it as a person of power ignoring the advise of qualified staff, occasionally just for the sake of what comes across as "i'm the boss."
it's still inexcusable for a county of this size to not have something in place though, especially after dozens of other widely reported stories of the exact same thing happening.
my largest complaint with these stories is when i see it staff made into the scapegoat because of the decisions made by management or supervisors.
if my local government was moving at a crawl it would be an improvement.
[deleted] that's three the failure trigger is in the last sentence.
that whole pesky "follow" rule doesn't always translate well.
we have tripled the amount of training given to employees in order to prevent these breaches.
it's still not nearly enough.
as a systems engineer, i can say that people, not passwords, are the weak link in any organization.
you can get the info you need for anything by just sounding convincing.
however, that doesn't give me an excuses to not keep my servers and hosts up-to-date and not pay attention to the latest trends in the security world.
this is just stupidity in the form of information technology.
they could have easily asked for more, so considering they are probably about to hire out someone new, then i can't imagine that it would end up costing them too terribly much in the whole scheme of things.
at this point i am blaming the victims.
how many other attacks, how many warnings do people need to back up their stuff and practice good data hygiene?
i work in a county it department that also services several towns.
we come across ransomware a couple times a year.
for the most part, it just bricks the employees computer.
one town had a police officer download an attachment that bricked their server.
it has carbonite on it, but they only opted for the basic plan which seemed to have throttled downloads.
they never knew this and only tested backups with one or two folders.
it took 3 days just to download the backup.
another guy bricked his machine and told us his department would pay the ransom because he had 10 years worth of data stored locally instead of storing in the cloud or file server, which we made available to everyone, but had not "forced" them to use it.
the administration denied his request because they didn't want to end up on the front page of the news and said it was his fault for not listening to it.
ransomware happens alot.
listen to your it department.
"hacker believed to be in ukraine or iran."
that's like saying: maybe in florida or saskatchewan.
occasionally my company will send out (via third party) a spam or phishing email with a link or attachment.
they can tell if you open it and then you get sent for additional it security training.
i get to monitor the general "contact@companyname.com" email address as part of my job.
it always makes me laugh how many emails we get along the lines of "this is your bank you use for business money.
your account is locked, reply with your bank details or you won't have any money".
simply stripping all attachments from emails would prevent most ransomware attacks.
governments need to assemble a global task force that can legally enforce cyber security, and arrest hackers giving them very harsh penalties.
not sure if you’re joking or really this ignorant.
&gt;ajit pai is the type of indian guy who eats dosa with a fork.
whoa!
i can't even show that to my children!
(and that was a hard r on the fork!)
he can just ignore him like he did the america public.
&gt; sceptic what the fuck makes being against it a 'sceptic'?
what the hell is he questioning about it?
seems like they’re trying to downplay his role in this.
“innocent man attacked with words” maybe they meant septic because he's a fucking disease on humanity he deserves every bad thing that comes his way.
even his kids getting hurt?
you're sick and need help i doubt that they're advocating for that, come on, now.
one thing i’ve learned since going to college and subsequently being surrounded by chinese and indian immigrants to the us is that the only people who hate indians more than the chinese are other indians.
he probably would be a thuggee.
no, he faces attack from fucking everyone its a-ok to be shitty if you dont like the person /s lol people were trying to justify his kids getting attacked over this seriously it just makes them look even more shitty than him [it seems pretty hypocritical to make those tweets, and also make this documentary.
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_problem_with_apu) using race to mock others contributes to the acceptance of racial stereotypes being brought up in the documentary.
no shit.... i, for one, am **shocked** that there's more than one of these creeps enjoying all the benefits of western society, while actively trying to dismantle all that it stands for.
/s at this point, you sort of have to put most of the blame on [the people letting them into the country.

you're born in some pretty awful country that routinely is engulfed in civil war, has abysmal healthcare, public stonings, the whole package.
you're then made an offer by politicians in by far the most developed societies in human history: if you come to their country and vote for them, they'll give you government handouts, they'll pass laws to prevent people from criticizing you or your religion, their media and universities will constantly churn out propaganda about how not having sex with you is bigotry, and there's absolutely no catch.
they'll pay for your children, they won't make you learn their language, if you commit a crime then you'll get a reduced sentence or even have it covered up by the police, they'll let you live in your own little migrant conclave which is just like home except with first world luxuries.
they'll even push forward a cultural shift so you're considered as valid a briton as someone who's lived there for your entire life and has ancestry there spanning back hundreds of years.
why, you don't even have to work, although they very much appreciate it when immigrants serve as scabs for citizens of the country who demand increases to their abysmal wages.
that's why you see so many republican politicians softening up on even illegal immigration.
corporations from disney to tyson to monsanto *love* open borders.
the majority of us would take them up on that.
that's an awesome deal.
so my friend immigrated to the uk from egypt to work as a gp, which we desperately need.
her english is perfect and although she’s muslim she is downright progressive in her politics, as many young egyptians are.
the hoops she has been made to jump through by the home office are appalling; the amount of money she has spent, and the pain she has suffered trying to secure a visa for her 3 year old daughter is appalling.
you’re narrative that are somehow welcoming to immigrants is so detached from reality, i can’t even fathom how you’ve come to it.
where are you getting this shit pumped into you?
she should've throw out her passport and claimed refugee status.
i think they were talking about refugee's not immigrants.
there's a big difference, open your eyes.
yeah.
refugees didn't have a choice in the matter.
leave or die.
the odds of being killed in a terrorist attack are 1 in 45,808. maybe we should take that enthusiasm for combating our problems and redirect it, and our resources, to problems that are more common.
you can spend billions on the tsa, on a wall, on militarizing the police, and no matter what you won't be able to stop terrorism.
short of becoming north korea and giving up the very ideals we're trying to protect, terrorism is simply impossible to get rid of.
but put those resources into medical and scientific research?
within a decade you'll see people living through afflictions that "should" have killed them.
you'll see quality of life go up for those suffering through chronic illness.
http://www.businessinsider.com/death-risk-statistics-terrorism-disease-accidents-2017-1 the fact islamic state terrorists are able to return and there are calls for ignoring/forgiving their joining a foreigh terrorist movement responsible for wsging wsr against the uk, and committing ethnic cleansing, slavery and carrying out all multitudes of terrorism responsible for the deaths of 10s of 1000s.
yeah your example of your one friend is really convincing.
i really don't think a lot of people on the pro-immigration side understand that their (almost always female, al-amira hijab wearing) second-generation muslim friend whose (lebanese, iranian, egyptian) parents that are/were wealthy (lawyers, doctors, scientists) and who attends university to follow in their footsteps or to get a gender studies/sociology degree while praying once every couple of days at home and maybe paying a few visits to a progressive tri-faith congregation on islam's holiest days is absolutely not anywhere close to being the average mena immigrant to a western country.
muslims are not progressive.
why the fuck does the u.k. need to be like america?
are you fucking insane?
welcoming to modern bongistan.
these guys are all just chilling in manchester, god they are fucked britain is fucked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fu7wv2itrtc people don't question their ideology because it is now 'islamophobic' to do so, so this shit has breeding ground, and we will refuse to eradicate it.
you want a far right uprising all over europe?
this is how you get a far right uprising all over europe.
p.s.
killing your enemy makes you win, not them mr tradueashit
i think that should be greeted as a positive by just about everybody.. cair would call you islamophobic.
cair is a hate group.
of course there's people who wouldn't greet it as positive, but when someone says "just about everybody" they mean the middle 95% of the us.
&gt;cair is a hate group cair is a fifth column.
i've never heard the term "[fifth column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fifth_column)" until today, had to look it up.
examples of cair spreading hate?
wasnt cair linked with the muslim brotherhood and other radical islamic groups?
they received money directly from a hamas (muslim brotherhood) money laundering front called the holy land foundation.
i may be a little confused here but i thought hamas and muslim brotherhood were two different organizations?
they're two wings of the same group.
mb is the "clean" political party and hamas is the "dirty" guerrilla fighting force.
how can that be true?
isn't muslim brotherhood sunni and hamas shia?
you may be confusing hamas and hezbollah.
hamas is sunni.
i suggest you look them up on wikipedia to start with.
they don't actively do it.
they are more insidious than that.
the cair organization itself is "above-board", however their insidiousness comes via their membership.
they are a "fifth column" organization (google the term if you need to).
there is indisputable evidence that many of their members have ties to foreign organizations which have openly and/or secretly funded or provided material aid to terrorists and/or terrorist groups.
they were implicated (directly) but not charged in a money laundering scheme for the muslim brotherhood, for example.
source?
i can't find a single reputable article confirming this.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holy_land_foundation_for_relief_and_development https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/check_from_terrorist_organization_hlf_to_islamic_organization_cair.jpg they're like an animals right organization that is a cover for poachers or an human rights organization by a dictator to offer cover.
they've been named as an unindicted co-conspirator in like 10 federal cases reputable sources are important, you shouldn't be downvoted for requesting truth.
any time you say anything bad about anyone who's done anything wrong and who follows islam, that's *obviously* islamophobic.
but the guy must not have been homophobic.
that'd go against the narrative.
has cair issued a statement about this?
please dont assume all of us condone terrorism.
im a muslim, i hope she gets life for aiding and abetting 49 murders.
there could also be an islamic argument she should get the death penalty that's why i said cair, not muslims.
i'm a white native born american, ideally my demographic should fit in with people who hate muslims in this country.
i'm mainly athiest, but there is an open house at a mosque in my city coming up, i don't intend to convert, but i intend to at least know more about muslims before i jump onto the boat of hating them which seems to be so popular in this country.
personally, i think it's hard being muslim in this country.
ignore the negative comments.
go through with that plan.
it's about experiencing and understanding, you can't blindly hate someone after spending a day with them.
fundamentalism is everywhere, in all religions.
americans have a lot of trouble identifying and admitting a huge chunk of them are religious fundamentalists.
as if christians are immune to it... the more you learn about their religion the more you'll despise it, as an atheist if there anything you don't like in christianity it's in islam except it's worse.
you can despise the religion without despising it's followers.
especially since people tend to be born into a religion.
never said you couldn't.
and they are indoctrinated into it as kids not born into it.
it's a religion.
what's in it is almost entirely defined by what the person practicing it wants to be in it.
that is a very protestant viewpoint.... a viewpoint that, notably, does not exist in islam.
that's not how that works, maybe kind of in the west but not in the middle east.
wow, you are such a virtuous person.
satan hates him... hard being muslim here?
what a joke.
do you know where it’s really hard being a muslim?
in muslim majority countries.
it's interesting that there seemed to be a big push to make everyone think mateen was just a closet homosexual, not a terrorist...but she's being charged with aiding a terror organization.
so it seems he was a closet terrorist, actually.
i mean, there is no reason they cant both be true and both be a factor.
the fbi looked into the claims he was gay and found they were unsupported and some just down right lies.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/omar_mateen#investigation_into_claims a bit of info for those interested.
&gt;on june 23, the los angeles times reported that the fbi has found no evidence "to support claims by those who say mateen had gay lovers or communicated on gay dating apps."
&gt;a man who self-identified as mateen's lover-of-two-months, "miguel", had said that he believed the massacre was out of revenge against latino men when mateen learned he may have been exposed to hiv from a puerto rican man with whom he had sex, but mateen's autopsy results confirmed that he was hiv-negative.
&gt;on june 25, the new york times reported that after exhaustive investigation with help from the fbi, the gay dating network adam4adam concluded that mateen had never used its app &gt;furthermore, the article stated that after 500 interviews, the fbi has not found any evidence of homosexuality "through (mateen's) web searches, emails or other electronic data" all of this is news to me, i've thought he really was gay.
the situation is totally confusing, like, why?
what is there to achieve by painting him gay?
it’s an attempt to discredit the idea he slaughtered all those people in the name of allah, which he explicitly stated he was doing as the massacre was happening.
why did the obama state department a) refuse to release the 911 calls in which mateen claimd allegiance to isis; b) give in, but only release a transcript in which they changed mateen's words of "allah" into "god."
c) finally release the unedited audio (after many months) but still downplay any connection to islamic extremism?
we all know the answer.
a gay man so oppressed by society, so torn with internal strife that he had no choice but to lash out at the sexual urges that consume him, lured by a terrifying instrument of death plays way better to the modern left than some shitbag islamic fundamentalist terrorist doing what they do, yet again.
no it was done in order to take away from the fact that it was a terrorist attack.
instead they claimed he was an oppressed homosexual and lashed out because of how terrible society was on him.
that's^exactly^what^he^said.
for the past year fake news had you successfully brainwashed.
and you ask why they do it?
because it works!
because it was an election year and cnn didn't wanna make it seem like there really is a problem with islam, or daesh agents that live here.
as someone who lives in orlando - apparently the first big push in the "closeted gay rage" direction was that someone made a fake grindr with his pictures like the day after the event.
so a lot of people saw him on there and freaked out.
and then it just spread via people looking for attention.
what was achieved was to cast doubt that the guy was just a normal jihadist.
in other words, it was a ....lets just say misguided attempt to protect islam.
lol remember when cnn had an exclusive interview with the terrorist's gay lover?
yeah, what was that guys name?
i think it was fiften minsofame?
2016 election was a crazy time, i like to think we've snapped back a bit from that sort of "journalism" but i know i shouldn't.
remember when the shooters father showed up at a hillary rally just days later.
completely bizarre.
do you remember when he showed up , hillary's people gave him reserved ( specifically approved ) seating behind the podium ?
yes.
truly bizarre.
here is the photo.
https://imgur.com/a/a6jha check the top posts on reddit this past week trump really made the media froth at the mouth and act in an entirely self-destructive way trying to take him down.
it was very sad seeing some of my favorite news organizations throw their journalistic standards to the side if it meant supporting their narrative.
the pissgate "dossier", the scaramucci fiasco, mateen's made-up homosexuality, and so many more.
and let's not forget that time cnn doxxed and blackmailed a guy who made a trump meme, threatening to publicly release his identity if he ever criticized them again.
trump didn't make them do anything.
all he did was show you who they really are.
people willing to throw away their integrity so easily did not have any to begin with.
have you seen how many have been fired or quietly let go.
i don't know if i have seen so many accused of sexual misconduct or poor journalistic integrity.
the thing is so many of these people were trumps biggest accusers.
i'd like to think that too.
and then i look at the news.
i think it was a meme that became viral helped by some people who had motive to shift the narrative away from jihadist terrorism.
i agree, i'm just saying that either the media or the government seemed to be pushing the closet homosexual thing and downplaying the terrorist theory.
of course they pushed for the gay route.
they don't want to talk about muslim terrorism.
why would they not want to talk about it?
goes against the "brown skinned people are universally innocent"-narrative.
how about the "all humans are capable of doing horrible things"?
is that a dumb narrative?
or is their something that extremely important about their melanin that make people act in certain ways?
that's a huge conflation.
not wanting people to generalize entire ethnic groups (sometimes incorrectly) as terrorists is not the same as universally innocent.
when this happened the san bernadino shooting was still in the public's memory, and europe was going through the refugee crisis while obama/state department was wanting to increase the number of syrian refugees we brought in.
you can't have the public seeing two people, muslim and by most outward appearances assimilated, be shown as violent threats.
...you know those quotation marks are there for a reason... the government can't stop talking about fucking muslim terrorism.
no matter what else is going on or whether it's remotely relevant.
some white dude kills or injures almost 600 people and still all we talk about is muslim terrorism.
some white dude shoots up a church or a temple or an abortion clinic and all we talk about is muslim terrorism.
tens of thousands of americans die to gun violence and all we talk about is muslim terrorism.
broken healthcare, stagnating wages, unemployment nothing but muslim terrorism.
you mean one party of the government can't stop talking about it, while the other side can't acknowledge it because for some reason they took islam under their wing, and feel the need to compulsively defend it from any criticism.
&gt; some white dude kills or injures almost 600 people and still all we talk about is muslim terrorism.
isis claimed stephen paddock converted to islam.
so even when a white dude kills or injures almost 600 people you can't get away from talking about muslim terrorism.
&gt;broken healthcare i thought the aca fixed healthcare?
i have seen that claim so much but still dont see it in the news.
several activists also tried to push the narrative that it was islamophobia (and white people) that motivated him to kill all those innocent people.
not necessarily disagreeing with you, but which activists?
&gt;but she's being charged with aiding a terror organization.
so it seems he was a closet terrorist, actually.
just because she's being charged doesn't mean its true.
just because they said it was a terrorist organization doesn't make that true, either.
and just because she's charged doesn't mean the deceased is a terrorist.
the number of assumptions involved here betray a real lack of critical thinking.
in a country where federal agencies routinely manufacture terror plots in order to arrest literally retarded muslims, it is insane to make any assumptions.
why not both?
it can be both, i'm just saying that either the media or the government seemed to be pushing the closet homosexual thing and downplaying the terrorist theory.
because only one is true (terrorism) i feel bad saying it, but what exactly did she do again?
i totally forgot with all the other terrible events in the news... didnt report to anyone that he had been planning a mass shooting of gays for years is it really planning when you talk about killing people for years without taking any steps to go through with it?
i just want to be sure i'm not going to be arrested as an accomplice if my coworker kills his wife like he has been swearing he was going to for years now.
i mean, jokes aside, i wonder what evidence they have that she should have known he was serious rather than just shooting his mouth off.
it's not just that she heard him talk about it.
from what i've read, she drove him to many gun stores where he bought guns (one source that she fronted the money or even bought a gun in her name, seems only alleged), and even drove him to pulse nightclub itself several times during the day to scope it out.
it's not like he was telling her, "i want to kill gay people" over and over again.
she was privy to aspects of his plan, his methods, and his actionable intention to murder gay people at the nightclub.
thanks, that's exactly the sort of info i wanted.
she also drove him to disney world.
where they both scoped the place out for a terror attack.
where disney security spotted them, and reported them to the fbi because disney could see they were scoping the place for a terror attack.
where the fbi did nothing.
source?
i never knew about that!
i really don’t have much faith in the fbi these days.
&gt; is it really planning when you talk about killing people for years without taking any steps to go through with it?
&gt; she drove him by the gay clubs to case the place.
[removed] yeah you're gonna be on some list now.... oh well.
maybe they can trace my activity and an nsa agent will find himself liking r/prequelmemes as much as the rest of us they'll find out about the droid attack on the wookies.
get them away from the sub.
its a sub we cant afford to lose.... i know this is the meme, but, *it's so very true...* so it’s treason then please, who do you think is responsible for all of the reposts?
i mean, sometimes when i'm stuck in traffic i pretend i'm goku and pretend to ki blast every fucking car around me.
if that's wrong i don't want to be right.
you're now on a list.
a list of weebs.
jokes on ya’ll i’ve been on that list its the only way we can throw suspicion off ourselves not on paper just as an intellectual exercise /s as far as i know, they think she knew of her husbands plans and chose to do nothing.
they think she is complicit.
i believe she did some interviews which did not do very well to shed those beliefs people have about her involvement.
if i recall, very unapologetic.
pretty sure she bought ammo for or with him and knew his plans.
and did scouting of places with him.
pretty sure she drove him there but not 100% on the last part.
i thought her defense was that she had learning disabilities so could be very easily manipulated by her husband and that her marriage was arranged through her father... who already knew he was a violent man based on the husband's previous failed marriage.
huh never heard that.
but from what i read she knew he was going to do it/something.
all it takes is a 911 call from her and 49 lives are saved.
fuck her.
her old teacher basically described her as boarderline retarded.
https://www.mediaite.com/online/abc-news-reports-that-orlando-shooters-wife-has-learning-disabilities/ well, learning disabilities and/or mental retardation need to be diagnosed by a medical professional.
a teacher's opinion is not a medical diagnosis.
getting bad grades is not a medical diagnosis.
etc.
if she received such a diagnosis before the shooting, she might be able to use that in her defense.
if she received one after it, the jury may not be swayed by it since anyone could deliberately performing poorly on iq tests to "prove" they're retarded when their freedom is on the line.
if she's found guilty, lock her up and throw away the key.
florida has some pretty unpleasant prisons and keeping the ac running isn't at the top of their priorities.
there's gonna be a *lot* of humid summers for this bitch before she kicks the bucket!
according to your source she had difficulty "learning".
in fact what they describe is maybe a form of adhd or dyslexia.
she was in "classes" but not in a special school.
if you hear her talk she isn't "retarded".
they're trying to play it up, like insanity.
she had a driver's license and was left at home to take care of the house.
stupid people get charged and convicted of crimes all the time.
in fact, i would argue that most prison inmates in general have significantly lower iqs than the general population.
as i understand it, she would have to be seriously retarded to the point of not understanding the charges against her and being unable to assist in her defense.
from what we know, she doesn't seem to have that level of impairment.
i remember this too.
i wish it was expanded on more because there is a huge difference between her being complicit to this while having a learning disability like dyslexia and her being complicit with some form of mental retardation.
i believe she actually helped him scout locations, including disney world.
the exact wording she used was "cased" in reference to dw.
she went on dry runs with him as well.
she dropped him off at pulse the night of the attack.
they have evidence to show that she is complicit.
including her story changing, her being privy to his planning.
helping him plan.
scope places out and even buy weapons doing it.
the only thing that really suggest otherwise, that we know, is that she says she didn't really know.
well if being complicit is wanting to be a force for good and to make a positive impact... good.
she went on dry runs with him.
she knew.
his whole family knew.
this isn’t the 1800s where news can stay localized.
the whole world saw the news about her husband, so the trial location is largely irrelevant.
if there is justice, she will never get to breathe free air again if there is justice she will be forced to breathe farts instead of free air forever the transition in the change of tone was flawless as an lgbt person living in orlando..... part of me hopes she rots in a cell.
the other part of me hopes she rots in a cell, but the twist is it's a slightly darker cell!
her defense is simple: “dear juries: my husband found a gun wrapped in clothes, he was trying to shoot a seal and it went off...” "it wouldn't stop shooting."
"seals everywhere!"
ah yes, the *zarate defense*.
i bet after the recent ruling she was *really* hoping for a trial in the bay area i don't think a place with such a large gay community would be very sympathetic towards her.
i didn’t think a place that leans so left would have let a man that killed a woman off so easily either.
especially given they are so hostile to guns.
you would think a case of gun violence like that would have resulted in book throwing at the defendant.
the only count he was convicted of was "felon in possession of a gun".
what's this about?
it's the kate steinle case.
jose inez garcia zarate found a stolen gun on a pier wrapped in a towel.
his account is inconsistent at times on whether the gun went off accidentally or if he intentionally shot it, but the bullet ricocheted, traveled 78 more feet, and hit steinle, killing her.
the bullet traveled 200 feet in total.
the jury ruled that he was not guilty of murder or manslaughter but that he was guilty of illegally possessing a firearm because they believed that he had no intent of trying to kill anyone.
because zarate is an illegal immigrant, conservatives have attempted to use this case as proof that illegal immigrants kill people.
"found a gun" he just wanted to shoot a few seals, leave the man alone zarate had been deported 5 times, but was still in the us due to "sanctuary city" san francisco.
missing a little detail.
he had been deported, meaning he actually had been sent out of the us.
all of his previous crimes were for possession of drugs, and like one or two for illegal entry into the us.
he re-entered, and had been arrested and served a prison sentence.
then afterwards ice asked the sf police to detain him longer so they could come get him, but sf doesn't comply with those requests so let him go (as they would have for any other person completing their sentence).
&gt;u.s. immigration and customs enforcement (ice) had issued a detainer for garcia zarate requesting that he be kept in custody until immigration authorities could pick him up.
however, as a sanctuary city, its “due process for all” ordinance restricted cooperation with ice to cases only where the immigrant had both current violent felony charges and past violent felony convictions; therefore, san francisco disregarded the detainer and released him.
he was released from san francisco county jail on april 15, 2015, and had no outstanding warrants or judicial warrants, as confirmed by the san francisco sheriff's department.
sure, he was missing the details, but he was right.
the whole case played out like oj.
i don't know wtf the jury was thinking.
this was a giant win for the gop and people being anti-immigrant.
note, thjs guy was a pos with several deportations.
i have no idea how he didn't at least get manslaughter.
i mean he was an illegal immigrant and he killed someone, haha i don't know what point you're trying to make?
&gt;jose inez garcia zarate found a stolen gun on a pier wrapped in a towel.
says the seven time felon, who was defended on the premise that he was too stupid to know better.
&gt;jose inez garcia zarate found a stolen gun on a pier wrapped in a towel.
his account is inconsistent at times on whether the gun went off accidentally or if he intentionally shot it, but the bullet ricocheted, traveled 78 more feet, and hit steinle, killing her.
the bullet traveled 200 feet in total.
his initial statement involved "shooting at seals", this is manslaughter at the minimum.
he was in custody months before the steinle incident.
sf authorities ignored ice's hold request and they let him walk.
had he been a us citizen he absolutely would have been in jail.
had sf held him for ice he would have been deported again.
&gt;because zarate is an illegal immigrant, conservatives have attempted to use this case as proof that illegal immigrants kill people kate steinle would be alive if it werent for this absurd legislation.
it's a bit ridiculous to shrug this off as a conservative witch hunt.
you were good until your last sentence, where your argument went to shit.
you don’t have to be conservative to be outraged that a city has harbored a 7 time felon and 5 time deportee who ended up killing somebody, accidentally or not, and walked away scott free.
....are you saying that an illegal immigrant didn't kill someone in this situation?
that sounds fairly reasonable, except for that last line.
thanks for the summary.
that would be pretty clear cut manslaughter.
manslaughter is when you kill someone unintentionally by acting irresponsibly.
good point.
i think that comes down to whether it was a (reasonably responsible) accident or not.
if i see a bundle on the ground and pick it up to see what it is, and it turns out it's a faulty gun that goes off from the movement, that's not necessarily irresponsible on my part.
not to say that's what happened here, but just as an example.
prosecutor was a fucktard.
except he was a seven time felon, and previously deported five times.
the city of san francisco's sanctuary laws were the only thing keeping him from being deported again.
this was at the sf pier and his initial excuse was that he was trying to shoot seals from the pier.
what other country can you commit seven felonies, illegally enter six times, kill someone with an illegal weapon, and get a free ride home after a few months in jail?
depending on the development of that country you would be in jail for a long time or dead.
shhhhhh enough with your logic, clearly the only outrage here is from conservatives trying to prove dreamers are violent /s if it was a white guy then yeah, sure, the book would have been thrown at him.
but it was a brown man who was in the united states illegally, which for some odd reason really tickles some chords for them.
it's a strange time, 2017.
&gt; if it was a white guy then yeah, sure, the book would have been thrown at him.
what, like being charged with murder, you mean, and tried before a jury?
you'd have thought the prosecution would be even the slightest bit competent.
it's almost as if the jury looked at the evidences and decided there was reasonable doubt that he intended to kill.
except he was being tried for manslaughter... intent doesn’t matter people driving vehicles that kill people are given manslaughter even though they didn’t mean to.
this.
there is not enough trust given to the people who actually sit through the trial, see all the evidence and deliberate before reaching a verdict.
they are *probably* in a better position than a random redditor to reach a verdict.
lol you people are so full of shit intent doesn’t matter in manslaughter, which he was charged with.
that’s right.
we don’t trust them at all.
it’s common knowledge that prosecutors are highly skilled at only getting conformist dummies on juries.
why on earth would we trust them?
again i don't know and neither do you what facts the jury got for sure or the instructions from the judge.
it seems like it might be a prosecutor error in how they tried it.
it's awful being on a jury.
witnesses and evidence shows that the bullet was not directed at her but ricocheted off stuff and then struck her.
he didn't intend to murder her.
he behaved in a dangerous and negligent manner.
he deserved involuntary manslaughter.
which the prosecution screwed up by using brandishing for the involuntary manslaughter charge rather than illegal possession of a weapon.
the prosecution blew the case, and the jury followed the law.
https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/12/06/kate-steinle-murder-trial-jury-didnt-botch-216016 i’m in no way okay with what happened.
i know, buddy.
sorry if it looks like i was implying you were.
agreed.
the crux is they somehow managed to convince at least one juror that it was possible that he didn't know the thing he picked up was a gun since it was wrapped in a towel.
the whole trial was ridiculous about that though.
they even had an expert witness lie to the court that the gun he fired wasn't drop-safe, when in reality the model of sig he shot her with has no recorded instances of drop-firing in an extensive service history.
it's possible that they were referring to the california-specific "handgun roster" which lists specific models that have been drop tested to the *state's* satisfaction.
handguns not on that roster cannot legally be sold by ffl dealers here.
while the p239 in .40 s&amp;w is on the list, this particular one was stolen from a blm vehicle, so it might have been a make/model that's not on the roster, since government agencies can issue weapons not on the list.
of course, it's obvious the entire purpose was to mislead the jury, since the differences between the dak version of the pistol and the dao and da/sa versions don't alter the firearm's drop safety characteristics... just want to offer a correction.
it was more than one juror since he was found not guilty.
i listened to mark o mara's comments, on smerconish, and he made a pretty good argument for the verdict.
isn't that how your legal system is supposed to work ... proven guilty and all that... which ruling?
why is that?
kate steinle yeah, but how is it relevant to this?
someone that is clearly guilty can get off free in that area.
widow drove husband to the nightclub, seems clear she knew what he was about to do.
i think you killed the hamster powering his brain.
kate’s wall.
as a resident of orlando, good.
too many people pushing narratives getting in the way of justice [deleted] yes, it seems strange to hold anyone around a criminal accountable for the criminal's actions.
if she truly conspired with him then she should be held accountable.
if he was just using her resources to become a, "gun enthusiast," or further advance his muslim faith, i don't know.
spouses can weave some pretty wicked nets of deception.
i don't know if she was a victim of the deception, or if she has the blood of those victims on her hands as much as he does.
the trial will hopefully expose it.
i thought you just didn't have to testify against your spouse.
i'm not sure about not reporting stuff like that beforehand.
what i wonder if how you can possibly prove what someone did or did not know.
are there texts or emails or anything written down?
i don't think spousal testimonial privilege extends to not reporting that they intend to commit a crime.
if it can be shown that she was aware of his intention it could be criminal negligence or something.
here the only privilege she has as his spouse would be that she cannot be compelled to testify against him.
idk!
hopefully the trial brings to light some of this.
i think she is being accused of buying him ammo and driving him to it, among other things?
i'm not sure and am having some trouble getting exactly what's going on here.
&gt; wasn't she prohibited from disclosing based on title vii 90.504 the statute does not prohibit anyone from telling the police about an imminent crime, it is for courts only and would not apply in a case where they are both accused.
poor little kid caught in the middle.
:( i read this as pulse shooter's window and was very confused.
she came out as gay so its all good!
finally, what a sigh of relief
well they weren’t going to use them.
personally i’m tired of dead people taking the good parking you don't know that!
unlives matter!
check your un-undead privilege!
undead yes unperson no alright, calm down reg :) so, off-topic, but he definitely has the best death scene in the entire series, yeah?
r/unexpecteddiscworld :p we prefer “mortally challenged”, thank you.
case closed &gt;the sheriff's office says bradley was videotaped parking in the disabled spot recently, and that a search of her home led to the discovery of permits issued to two people who have died.
so this was serious enough to get a warrant for her home?
it seems more like a witch hunt to me.
"go ahead and search my home!
you won't find anything!"
-- something somebody dumb enough to park in front of city hall with dead people's parking permits might say.
if someone is caught breaking the law, it's a witch hunt?
not at all.
what i am suggesting is that the mayor pissed someone off, and that someone went out of their way to find dirt on her.
if she did steal those placards i hope they strip her of office and toss her in jail.
but i hope this isn't some sort of setup, because it looks like one.
quite possible... i'm from that area, so when i saw the headline, i was thinking "please don't let it be polk county".... but, of course it was!
how is it a witch hunt if they have video evidence of her breaking the law?
a witch hunt does not indicate persecution of an innocent person, it is undue persecution.
it sounds like the sheriff got mad at her so he had her followed, trying to find something they could charge her with.
&gt; it sounds like the sheriff got mad at her so he had her followed, trying to find something they could charge her with.
that's plausible, but it's equally plausible that the police are just doing their jobs.
i would want to see some evidence before jumping to that line of thinking.
she's been charged with multiple felonies.
call me crazy, but searching her home for evidence seems reasonable.
i don't see why someone would look at that and jump to "the sheriff is out to get her".
okay, now for the really pedantic part.
&gt; a witch hunt does not indicate persecution of an innocent person, it is undue persecution.
i don't think that's true.
definitions of the term vary, but i haven't found one yet that would cover this situation.
for reference: [wiktionary:](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/witch-hunt) &gt; (2) an attempt to find and publicly punish a group of people perceived as a threat, usually on ideological or political grounds.
&gt; (3) a public smear-campaign against an individual.
(note: a "smear" is, [by definition](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/smear), false) [dictionary.com:](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/witch-hunt) &gt; an intensive effort to discover and expose disloyalty, subversion, dishonesty, or the like, usually based on slight, doubtful, or irrelevant evidence.
[merriam-webster:](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/witch%20hunt) &gt; the searching out and deliberate harassment of those (such as political opponents) with unpopular views.
[cambridge english dictionary:](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/witch-hunt) &gt; an attempt to find and punish people whose opinions are unpopular and who are said to be a danger to society [oxford living dictionary:](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/witch-hunt) &gt; a campaign directed against a person or group holding unorthodox or unpopular views.
so looking at those definitions, do you see how innocence is not presumed or even suggested?
i'll meet you halfway, then.
innocence isn't *necessarily* presumed, but it is heavily implied.
in a witch-hunt, legal and harmless behavior is misinterpreted as evidence of a crime.
it's perfectly possible that bad evidence and bad assumptions can lead to a correct conclusion; it's just unlikely.
the negative connotation of the term *comes* from the fact that witch-hunts almost always turn out to be baseless.
there's a subtle distinction here that i want to go back to.
you said this: &gt; a witch hunt does not indicate persecution of an innocent person, it is *undue* persecution.
that's true in one sense: a witch-hunt is undue because it's based on faulty evidence and/or assumptions.
it *doesn't* apply to someone who is unduly punished for a crime they actually committed.
&gt;that's true in one sense: a witch-hunt is undue because it's based on faulty evidence and/or assumptions.
it *doesn't* apply to someone who is unduly punished for a crime they actually committed.
awesome.
so now will you agree with me on other points as well?
1: innocent until proven guilty 2: police officers have been known to fabricate and plant evidence 3: political opponents have been known to use similar tactics to remove someone from office 4: the video evidence indicates surveillance, the reason for which was not given in the article 1. she'll have her day in court.
2. does that invalidate all evidence?
3. what, catching them in the act of committing a crime?
4. no it doesn't.
first of all, the article doesn't say who took the video.
it could have been the police, or a handicapped person who was pissed off that she was taking a parking space, or some other random person.
second, i would expect there to be a pretty significant police presence at city hall.
if they saw someone breaking the law, it would make sense to record them for evidence, particularly if that person is a prominent politician in the town.
third, even if they *were* watching her, you're basically pulling an explanation out of your ass as to why.
if she was breaking the law on a regular basis, what other motivation does there need to be?
seems like the cops are damned if they do, damned if they don't.
if they don't go after law-breaking politicians, they're corrupt.
if they do, they're trying to manipulate the democratic process.
the sheriff of polk county likes witch hunts https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/09/11/florida-sheriff-sued-after-threatening-to-scour-hurricane-shelters-for-criminals/ i see ~~dead people~~ what you did there.
wouldn't the mayor already have a dedicated parking spot?
they changed the laws in florida several years back to require actual medical necessity for disabled parking permits (to combat fraud).
before the laws changed it was a form at the dmv and whatever the permit fee was.
that doesn’t stop the fraud.
loads of people use it when they aren’t disabled.
last week alone i saw someone park in a spot (with the placard) and literally run in the store because it was raining.
i found it funny ...but i’m sure someone who really needed the spot didn’t.
i tend to park wherever i see a spot to get an extra few steps in my life for health reasons.
just because you see someone run doesn't mean they are not handicapped.
&gt;last week alone i saw someone park in a spot (with the placard) and literally run in the store because it was raining doesn't mean they aren't legit.
believe me, i've seen the threads with people explaining just what's wrong with them even though they don't seem sick.
also doesn't mean that it couldn't have been fake.
the piece of gutter trash that lived with his elderly mom across the street from me used her parking permit for over a year while she was out of the house getting medical care.
(i'm happy to say that despite working out at the gym every day he died before 50. i've just assumed the many years of drug abuse killed him or maybe he caught something from those hookers he used to bring home.)
so it does happen.
i just no longer judge unless i'm sure of the facts of the situation.
and with a stranger, i'm not sure.
he needs more parking spots, in front stores, other businesses.
&gt; the mayor of a small florida city has been arrested on allegations that she used dead people's disabled parking permits to park at city hall.
yeah but at city hall doesn't make sense seriously, i'd assume the mayor would have their own spot.
and it's a small town, parking can't be that bad.
you would think so, but they don't the gpw of 1776.. the mayor's spot is 15 feet further than the handicapped spot.
busy officials need to prioritize their valuable time.
people are lazy like that especially ones who need the extra calorie burning in their lives.
i like the people who drive around the parking lot for 10 mins trying to find a close spot.
when they get out of the car you can clearly see why they want said spot.
aren't disabled spots usually bigger than the rest, and positioned as close to the entrance as possible?
normally one or two have the van loading extra space, not all of them though.
and dedicated parking spaces are pretty close as well.
depends on location fair enough.
i don't think that conflicts with my hypothesis, though.
hearse was parked in it why?
i can understand corruption for a billion dollars.
it's still corruption but i can see how that could be tempting.
but something as petty as parking permits?
do public officials have such contempt for the people and decency?
how do people like this get to be mayors?
have you ever seen what some people do with basic moderation powers on an internet forum?
some people abuse even the tiniest amount of power.
you are now a moderator of r/politics you are now a moderator of /r/pyongyang.
hell, one of the mods in r_awww told me they'll ban anyone they want to over any reason they want to.
it doesn't have anything do with breaking the rules.
how pathetic that person's life must be that that's what they cling to to make them feel important.
[deleted] like you?
&gt; how do people like this get to be mayors?
by cheating - it's how you win.
that's why they teach us that it's wrong - so we don't win.
how do people like this get to be mayor?
seriously?
this is the us here the capital of the country washington d.c. had a mayor who was elected after he has done time for smoking crack with a prostitute lol edit to biggly the word after bitch set him up!
she was bored polk county is the appalachians of florida.
a lot of wretchedly poor hillbillies there.
&gt;why?
i can understand corruption for a billion dollars.
it's still corruption but i can see how that could be tempting.
but something as petty as parking permits?
do public officials have such contempt for the people and decency?
how do people like this get to be mayors?
people ruin their careers over small things because they don't think they'll be caught.
we had a school principal who was doing some kind of scam over high school football tickets.
it netted him a few hundred dollars, a firing and probably made his unemployable in the field.
i rarely support more perks for politicians, but they should definitely get the best parking spot.
is something wrong with their legs?
you don't think handicapped people deserve the best spots..?
fuck politicians.
bunch of snakes!
no they deserve some sadly some places give them all the best spots.
i'm looking at you krogers 9 billion handicap spots rarely have i seen a fraction of them filled.
and davenport only has a couple thousand people.
it's just a power trip.
wow, this mayor's cops must hate her or something.
sheriff is a county-wide elected official.
a mayor of a small city within the county ain't shit to him.
follow this, mark my words i wouldn't be surprised if the city's cops don't like her also, or accusations are made that the sheriff is cozy with someone who wants to run for mayor of that city.
every time i open an article about florida doing something fucked up i always pray it isn’t polk county.
and when i see it is, i pray it isn’t lakeland.
luckily, today is was good ol’ shitty davenport me too but just so i don't have to see sheriff judd grandstanding for the thousandth time!
oh my god that man has so many people so far up his ass it’s ridiculous... when i saw him all over the news during irma i nearly had a damn stroke at least you're not vegas.
having to see our shitty sheriff all over the news through october was awful.
oooh but you know that i as a regular citizen would be charged with way more if i was caught using dead peoples parking permits.
i mean, "charged with multiple felonies", sounds pretty bad.
true that.
i'm coming to realise that i'm the kinda guy that serves as a reminder that the internet is a "take it with grain of salt" kinda place.
is this sarcasm?
i don't know anymore &gt;oooh but you know that i as a regular citizen would be charged with way more if i was caught using dead peoples parking permits.
no, you'd probably just get a ticket.
they normally don't serve search warrants for parking offenses.
so florida mayor leads the town where florida man and florida woman live right?
must be nice living around so many celebrities!
this mayor must have pissed someone off.
as far as i know this is standard municipality practice.
it's not the first time i've heard of this trick but usually it's a rumor or just someone running their mouth.
never heard of it actually being looked into.
florida woman strikes again!
edit: thank you rising.
florida **woman** the mayor doesn't automatically get a decent parking spot at city hall?
handicapped parking spaces are usually bigger than normal ones, and as close as possible to the entrance.
shitty behavior but not really worth an arrest and felony charge, maybe just a large fine followed by subsequent public shaming.
a felony should involve actual harm done to people, not just finding a sneaky way to park closer to your work.
i mean you might as well start arresting everyone who borrows a relative's placard to go to the mall, or takes a shit in the handicapped stall in a public bathroom because its roomier.
there's shitty behavior that doesn't rise to the level of serious criminality, this is one of those cases where a fine is enough.
yes, people who borrow a placard in the manner you suggest should be arrested.
the ones harmed are handicapped individuals, who the space is reserved for.
also, missing your power as an elected official is frowned upon.
this lady messed up.
welcome to polk county.
good ole grady judd using them tax dollars to maximum effect.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/09/11/florida-sheriff-sued-after-threatening-to-scour-hurricane-shelters-for-criminals/ the handicapped stall isn't reserved, but i do feel like people should be arrested for parking in not only handicapped parking, but no parking emergency lanes.
seriously though... they park on tip of a giant painted no parking, with another one in front of them, and a sign on the pillar next to them.
but they can't be bothered to park to buy their smoothie... &gt; takes a shit in the handicapped stall in a public bathroom because its roomier.
there's nothing illegal about that.
just like you can use the family restrooms even though you don't have family with you.
florida man got elected?
florida, where you drive north to go south.
this story is so miami the parking dead?
only, no daryl.
who cares?
that's a hilarious mayor move.
unless he was raping everyone it's just not going to make news, these days.
this sucks, because if this is actually true, it's more ammunition to push and pedal the myth that elections are corrupt because they are using the names of "dead voters", which is overwhelmingly fucking bullshit casey anthony george zimmerman the beans ... florida is full of walking talking shit stained roaches that are corrupt from top to bottom.
it's this bad everywhere.
florida just has laws giving the press free, open, nearly-instantaneous access to police data.
crazy shit is happening all over, you just don't hear about it nearly as much.
i'm aware sadly sheriff joe served over 20 years in my home county .
just to illustrate he allowed 400+ sex crimes to go uninvestigated .
not only that though we know he likes to start witch hunts, to distract from his own departments failures.
so he did shit for publicity to make him seem hard on crime when he was letting the real criminals free.
a righteous person doesn't continually get sued and lose.
she's a person with power and money, so nothing will be done about it.
edit - words.
she, not he she's a mayor of a small town in central florida.
i doubt she's seriously connected or is loaded with cash
your eyes say 14, but your hairline says 40 yoo, that dude at least 40 that 40 year old man is 14?
detroit... what a town.
yeah things have gotten pretty dark there as of late.
technically this was in warren.
it's technically a suburb of detroit.
its southern edge borders detroit on 8 mile road.
for decades, it was a blue-collar city full of auto factory workers.
these days, it's basically "north detroit".
i lived there for many years, including during its rapid decline.
homes were foreclosed and later purchased as rental properties.
it went from hard-working people and their families, to section 8 ghetto in a period of a few years.
everything between 8 mile and 11 mile is a festering hell-hole, and i now have the same feelings of anxiety driving through that city as i do in detroit or flint.
eastpointe here, lived there from birth til 14. moved out to the mt clemens area in 2004. it used to be such a nice town, as far as child-me could tell anyway.
on return trips to the area, it's basically done nothing but decay over the past decade-plus-change.
old mainstays of the town have gone as well, namely pete &amp; frank's fruit market.
holy hell, i haven't thought of pete &amp; franks since the 80s.
that's some nostalgia right there.
i lived in eastpointe... well, east detroit, from 80-85. i have relatives there now, and i wouldn't visit without a gun.
actually, same goes for mt.
clemens i guess.
i lived there for a few years also.
i lived in the trailer park next to the traffic light... which of course isn't exactly a nice part of town.
mt.
clemens is weird though.
from one block to the next you have ghetto/nice/white trash/nice and so forth.
but yea, eastpointe and warren are both places i'd rather not ever go again.
i'll throw roseville in there too for good measure.
you get anxiety driving through flint?
why?
most of the roads are wide and well lit (dort, saginaw, ballenger, atherton, miller, center, ect are all 4 lanes for most areas).
i rarely see loiterers anymore.
i mean yeah, it's poor and all, but i'm not sure it is as bad as people try to make it out to be.
there is a lot of blight that is slowly being bought and renovated.
most violence in flint nowadays seems to be violence against people who know each other.
just to post this here in regards to local news: http://www.mlive.com/flint/ detroit is essentially a third world country.
we need to build walls around the city so they don't spread.
or try to come up with solutions to improve the area?
detroit is part of america.
there actually has been a huge push to help detroit.
i just finished a paper on how the government has been supporting the detroit land bank authority to mitigate some of the decay across the neighborhoods.
and dan gilbert’s been investing a lot into the city to help it economically.
i feel, having watched the local abc affiliate station basically roll around in "detroit's on a comeback" for the past handful of years, that they're focusing a lot on the city center, while the outlying areas continue to decay.
did you touch on that at all?
is it accurate?
the state has been trying to gentrify detroit for the last few years.
there have been a few hipster communities that have popped up over the years but the city is still rotten to its core.
you're looking at a city with an estimated 14 to 20 billion in debt and a long list of indicted city officials ranging from school principles to mayors.
the only way you're going to fix detroit is by purging the entire system yes and no.
it's kinda due to the different natures of the work being done in each area.
so what you're talking about in the city center is a lot of the stuff being done by people like gilbert through his companies, rock ventures and quicken loans.
they're big improvements, but they're also quick to implement relatively speaking.
there's actually quite a bit going on with the neighborhoods through the land bank and the blight removal task force.
the difference is that the land bank process is inherently slow compared to some of the stuff going on in the city center.
they have to first identify and acquire blighted properties, then they either put them up for sale to renovator-owners or slate them for demolition.
selling them is a waiting game for buyers to show up and even then, if they don't meet the requirements of the deed-in-escrow renovation contract they sell them under, the land bank winds up with the property again.
in terms of demolition, they've actually at one point demolished so many homes per week that they've reached a diseconomy of scale due the demolitions costs rising.
pretty sure at one point the price of backfill materials skyrocketed due to the land banks demolition work.
now compare that quicken loans moving it's offices to a building downtown, or even the city building the q-line and those seem much quicker and impressive gains for the city.
not to mention the land bank has to go through this process for like 85 thousand properties so the process seems much slower.
edit: forgot to mention that one of the programs gilbert's people are running is literally a re-branding campaign that's trying to sell detroit as a growing tech hub called opportunity detroit.
that may have something to do with the focus on the city center.
i honestly am starting to think the only thing that will work would be national guardsmen on every corner for two years and an iraq style nation building program.
of course, that's not going to happen for a million reasons, most of which i'd probably agree with, but i think it's so fucked i don't know what else would do it.
we should put some democrats in charge for fifty years straight this happened in warren... a suburb of the city not even in the same county as detroit.
also a historically white area.
why don't you get up from your computer and see what detroit is like for yourself.
have you been to warren in the past 15 years?
particularly south warren?
if you took away the signs, you'd never know when you left detroit and entered warren.
"historically white" has nothing to do with anything in 2017 warren.
"sweden is a hellhole full of rapists" same people argue this shit about anywhere they think is "too liberal" without ever being outside their home town.
historically white until ruined by mutants like this hurrr durrr detroyt iz bad cuz newz says so.
if someone posted, "new york... what a town."
would you automatically jump to assuming they want it destroyed?
that's not the comment i replied to.
oh shit, you're right.
i dunno how i missed yo mama's dildo i don't know either.
according to everyone on xbox its pretty massive.
that 14 year old has a mustache that lots of young men would envy.
hope he’s tried as an adult.
that's what the article you didn't read says.
there is only one punishment fit for rape.
is it rape?
there are only two punishments fit for rape... i think everyone would take being raped over being executed or hell even over a year in jail.
death is what it should be guess he wasn't on the schools football team.
i think you meant basketball and the ball family stuff like this is why white flight exists most rape tends to be committed by chubby white southern and midwestern guys, they just have a daddy who’s buddies with the sheriff.
but yeah i admit black community has some cultural problems with toxic masculinity.
are you still living in the 50s?
hope they turn out his corn hole i wonder when people express things like this--does the thought of someone you feel "deserves to be raped" being raped give you a sense of sexual excitement?
--is it more about feeling a sense of power for your superior ability to control your parallel impulses?
--or is it a sense of catharsis at the idea of a karmic justice being meted out upon a being who represents a darker shade within you taken form externally and made to suffer for being a manifested demonstration of the part of yourself you wish you could deny?
if he raped my 14 year old daughter?
yes.
i would want him violated and ruined for what he did.
i would want him to suffer for the rest of his life.
we were all 14. did i ever think about raping someone?
no.
he is an animal that deserves the worst kind of punishment.
there is no rehabilitation.
so you have never thought about raping someone but you are thinking about having a desire for someone to be raped by a proxy?
also, to be clear--it wasn't your daughter, right?--so the whole if it was your daughter thing seems out of left field... if you were trying to say "that's somebody's daughter!"
well yes, and the perp in this case is somebody's son.
and them getting raped doesn't unrape anybody.
the prison rapist having a cheering squad doesn't punish the prison rapist for the crimes that put them in a position to be instruments of perverted rape justice for the sake of rape boners.
there is a logical disconnect and people are failing to recognize that while yes some justice is called for, the instinctive impulse for justice in certain shapes is poorly thought out at best people who rape people can’t really be helped.
they will just do it again later.
it’s a faulty wire in the brain.
can’t fix it.
this is a very basic human emotion to want to take action against an injustice.
no need to complicate it or pretend you've never felt that way.
it served a purpose when we were animals without a justice system but now we're left with the same feelings and a better idea of how to deal with criminals (but not quite there yet).
&gt; this is a very basic human emotion &gt; no need to complicate it or pretend you've never felt that way.
it served a purpose when we were animals without a justice system but now we're left with the same feelings you mean like .....a desire to rape?
a desire to mate is innate.
it would be a good idea to control that if no one told you.
am i following if i interpret your sentiment to be that it would have been a good idea for the rapist from this story to control his desires, but it for some reason wouldn't be a good idea for the other user to control a desire for the rapist to be raped, nor for that user to even attempt to control urges leading them to express such a desire?
&gt; catharsis at the idea of a karmic justice... blah blah blah.
people want to see bad things happen to bad people.
welcome to earth.
indeed, yet "bad" is subjective, and so those seen as bad people may see those they harmed as bad people...the type of bad people people want to see bad things happen to.. so they do those bad things to people they see as bad, making them bad... which begs the question of what that means about people who'd want to see bad things happen to people they believe to be bad... his fb is still up.
and he has a little sister!
he's got such an old look.
is this kid born evil or a result of his environment?
hard to say with the information from the article.
could be one or the other or both.
[deleted] no.
just stop.
says the cretin who still thinks president obama was born in kenya.
14 and charged as an adult, that must just be for black kids.
how old was that white kid who raped three girls and did what a month in juvie.
i think he is charged as an adult because not only did he rape her, he beat the shit out of her for over 30mins.
hes also getting false imprisonment which is never a good thing.
did you read the article?
article says 20 minutes, did you read the article?
i hope for much worse for this 14 year old [removed] someone as worthless as you would defend a rapist [deleted] &gt; i will wait for all the facts before i support either the accused or the accuser.
from the article: &gt;police said there are 50 video security cameras inside the school, and more than one recorded the attack.
since it was described as the "most vicious case i've seen" by the police commissioner and she fought him off for 20 minutes, chances are they have plenty of proof she's not lying.
and here i thought headlines were sufficient for all the information /s there were cameras all over the school where they saw the accused fighting off the accuser before it happened... unless you're also waiting for the footage to be released before you got all the facts... and even if that happened you'll probably want to know whether the footage was doctored before you got all the facts... and even then you still won't have all the facts.
in fact, you will never have all the facts in any of these cases unless you were right there in person witnessing it.
of course he did.
why wouldn't you attack a store 3000 miles away from jerusalem.. owned by a guy (*see:jew*) that doesn't live in israel.
makes perfect sense.
/s clearly not racism.
whatever it is, not racist only “white” people can be racist or something like that... big chance it's because of religion.
you can hate jews because of their religion.
jews aren’t a religious group.
it’s a hate crime.
yes they are.
they are both an ethnicity and religious group.
are you telling me i can't covert to judaism?
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/conversion_to_judaism you can go through a process to become part of the nation, but that has nothing to do with religious beliefs.
a jew can practice any religion or no religion and will still be a full jew.
or for taking and occupying land and ruling over muslims in apartheid..or you could just be racist.
if only that was actually what's happening.
alas, it's not.
they themselves call the west bank territories.
the idf has military that goes into the west bank.
hmmm, perhaps because hamas stockpiles rockets, bombs, and missiles in schools and hospitals in the west bank and gaza.
what is israel supposed to do?
just let themselves be unjustly attacked?
first you said that isn't happening now you're saying it is happening.
which is it?!?
i never once said that israel doesn’t have a military presence in the west bank.
what i said is that they haven’t taken over land and ruled over muslims in apartheid.
israel’s military actions are purely for the self-preservation of their own people who are constantly threatened/attacked.
&gt; clearly not racism.
whatever it is, not racist if it's not blind racism then why didn't the guy attack an american store.. say a mcdonalds.
they do have mcdonald's in holland ..i've been there.
so it would be okay if they attacked a mcdonalds as well?
what world do you live in?
&gt; so it would be okay if they attacked a mcdonalds .. i didn't say that.
it would make actual sense if he attacked an american target.. considering this is all about america acknowledging jerusalem as israel's capital.
what does a jewish-owned store **in amsterdam** have to do with jerusalem?
&gt;what does a jewish-owned store **in amsterdam** have to do with jerusalem?
are you actually no understanding the connection from the pov of the attacker?
i'll fill you in: jews.
to these people, all of us everywhere in the entire world are legitimate targets for anything having to do with israel.
they all have dual citizenship and send money to israel so they are supporters of said country believed by many to be the source of all conflict in the middle east.
i'm not taking sides - just throwing a nickel in the pool of thought.
&gt; they all have dual citizenship i don’t know where you got that from, but it’s not true.
&gt; said country believed by many to be the source of all conflict in the middle east.
anyone can believe anything.
it doesn’t make it true.
depends on how the attacker sees them, i guess?
maybe he thinks the store's owners supported the move, or overheard them support it.
in any case, it's fair to blame trump for any increase in violence related to the middle east.
the next terroristic attack will be his fault too, for the needless provocation, because he was warned that this would happen if he calls jerusalem the capital of israel.
heck, the next recruitment cycle of terrorists will use trump's move to get even more people to join them.
and no one will take the u.s. as an acceptable partner or overseer of peace talks.
therefore it was a bad move any way you look at it.
is it trump's fault really though?
if it is then what's the difference between blaming trump for the violence caused by the recognition of jerusalem as the israeli capital and blaming charlottesville's government for agitating the nazi that killed heather heyer by taking the confederate statue down?
can't we at least put the majority of the blame on the people that actually commit the violence?
these aren't savage animals, they're human beings and every day billions of people don't commit vandalism or violence against people and things that they feel have wronged them.
the violence was forseeable, trump was warned, he chose to do it anyways.
therefore he is to blame for his own decision, that is causing this violence.
it's literally like this: the world: "hey trump, don't do it!
none of us recognized jerusalem as the capital of israel, because it is an affront to international law and to the entire muslim world.
it's going to cause violence and pour gasoline on the middle east's fires!"
the u.s. state department, general mcmaster and other seniors with vast experience: "don't do it mr. president!
this will lead to violence, will kill the two state solution and will virtually remove the u.s. from any peace agreement role!"
virtually everyone: "don't do it!
this will lead to violence and death!
don't make this decision!"
trump: "lol fuck you all!"
- does it anyways /violence increases morons: "duhhh trump isn't to blame guys come on!"
well to be sure there is a point to be made there, but i feel like that treats the pro-palestinian vandal here more like a wild animal rather than a human who is responsible for his own decisions.
-you can't blame the bear if one of the humans teases him with a steak and gets his buddy gets mauled in turn.
-you can't blame the palestinian if a western leader recognizes jerusalem is and a fellow westerner is attacked in turn.
there is logic in your statement, though.
i see it there and understand the position.
i think the dispute is due to semantics alone here: trump is to blame for any increase in violence, but the individual acts of violence are attributable to those carrying it out.
trump's culpability is clear in circumstances where it is shown that but-for trump's decision, the violence would not have occurred or people/property would not have been harmed.
this of course doesn't mean that illegal acts by violent actors are somehow not ascribable to the actors, of course.
a good way to look at it is to understand that trump is responsible for provoking the violence, whereas the actors are legally responsible for their own crimes.
so true.
it was trump he gave this man a genocidal hatred for the jews./s trump was warned violence will happen if he picked jerusalem for our embassy.
he did so anyways.
violence then occurs.
trump is not to blame?
lol no, as a matter of fact, trump is not to blame for the violent actions of genocidal savages.
yes, as a matter of fact, trump is responsible for his decision to provoke violence and destroy any chances for peace because the consequences were easily foreseeable and the entire world warned him about these specific consequences.
as much as trump sucks, which he really does, it was still the right move to do.
israel shouldn’t have to be delegitimized by not having their sovereignty recognized simply because a bunch of terrorists will be violent.
you're saying that because you support israel's claim to the palestinian city of jerusalem.
i get it.
however, this is objectively bad for peace and hence objectively a terrible decision.
you can spam that all you want it doesn’t make it true.
it's not true because i'm saying it, it's just a logical observation.
;) the only people to blame are the ones who act out.
nah, trump is at least partly responsible.
i mean, it was foreseeable that this would happen, and trump was warned against making that decision from the world over... he can't escape responsibility now.
you suggest that the right decisions can't be made if there is a threat that unhinged people are going to act out?
i'm suggesting that anything that destroys any chance of peace and provokes violence *is* the wrong decision.
any terrorist attacks will be blamed on trump?
jesus how first worldly can you get!
apparently to you foreigners are idiots or animals who can't control their actions!??
please tell me you're just an uninformed high schooler and not an adult who failed high school.
&gt; jesus how first worldly can you get!
considering that we in the first world are intimately aware of how terrorism feels, i'd say my point is spot on.
or have you forgotten 7/7, 9/11, or terrorism in france, spain, netherland, etc?
and now that i've read your comment, i've realized i'm talking to a very triggered person.
good luck to you and hope you have a better day from this point on.
:) would you say trump was "asking for it"?
would you say the attackers should have attacked a mcdonalds because it makes "more sense" to react that way to trump's decision?
oh, you already said it.
lol a) i did not say that and b) i gave no idea what your point is supposed to be, and i'm guessing from the quality of your other comments that you don't either yes.
after all of the cold fries i've gotten from mcdonald's, i'm going to have to say, yes.
all jews need to be punished.
-anti israel activists &gt; all jews... [and that's what is really about] (https://youtu.be/n4mq63fuweo).
some people (**see: link**) are enraged that west jerusalem is the capital of israel.. *because jews*.
edit: ..for people who don't know that is the leader of the palestinian people talking in that video.
he [wrote an book and thesis] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_other_side:_the_secret_relationship_between_nazism_and_zionism) about how the zionists conspired with the nazis, and the holocaust was a lie.
*out of all the subjects on earth that's the one he chose to write about*.
i'll leave you to make your own conclusions.
&gt; the zionists conspired with the nazis because it sure would be inconvenient if palestine conspired with the nazis.
like the time when haj amin el-husseini was making deals and agreements with nazi germany... &gt; are enraged that west jerusalem is the capital of israel.. there would be much less of an issue if israel included the "west" part like you did.
the fact that they don't is one of the biggest controversies.
&gt; there would be much less of an issue if israel included the "west" part like you did.
and it would my much less of an issue if the leader of the palestinians wasn't on their television saying *"jews defile jerusalem with their filthy feet"* [and then encourages his people to martyr themselves there] (https://youtu.be/n4mq63fuweo).
but we can't have everything we want.. can we?
;) what if the people who go berserk at his announcement are responsible for their own actions?
people whose knee jerk reaction is violence and destruction are a bigger problem than trump's idiocy.
it's europe, so i assume the restaurant was fined for having islamophobic glass.
off course.
there’s also a video of police just standing by while it happens.
*terrorist* holding flag of a nation that doesn't exist due to its continuing atrocities commits anti-semitic attack on jewish store owner.
these titles need to tell the whole story.
&gt;terrorist holding flag of a nation that doesn't exist *half of reddit comes screaming for your head* you mean, doesn't exist, and never has existed in the past.
this is a hate crime.
unless you would also have all other hate crimes declared terrorist attacks.
hate crime are a better descriptor than terrorism and applying a terrorism designation on a hate crime property crime dilutes the seriousness of both types of crimes.
also i am a jew so to prevent someone accuses me of something.
you are a special kind of stupid sir.
do yourself a favor and look up the sykes picot agreement and the balfour declaration, fucking nittwit.
it's interesting how the author claims the man was motivated by trump recognizing jerusalem as the capital of isreal.
yet nowhere in the article is there a reference to the vandal's claim of motive.
now people will start blaming trump for middle east unrest.
&gt;now people will start blaming trump for middle east unrest.
considering that people predicted trumps actions would leave to more violence, it's totally reasonable to blame him when an increase in violence actually occurs.
i'm as repulsed by trump as anyone else but come on, you have to admit it is unreasonable to hold trump accountable for this man's actions.
no one, least of all trump, forced or compelled this man to attack the restaurant.
absolutely zero people are responsible for his actions other than himself, regardless of the geopolitical climate.
it’s reasonable to blame trump for anti jew attacks because muslims have no control over their own actions/s.
that excuse sounds pretty racist when you stop and think about.
you are right - you also don't have to preface your remark by saying you're repulsed by trump.
it's obviously reasonable to blame trump because he was repeatedly told by world leaders not to inflame the muslim world, that it would lead to violence if he called jerusalem the capital, that it would spark more conflict, that it would be like pouring fuel on the fires of the middle east, etc.
it's actually happening now.
so obviously trump is to blame for the unnecessary provocation.
i bet it's the battered wife's fault she made her violent husband angry, too.
she shoulda known not to make him angry.
who is the wife in this case though?
is trump being attacked by that guy in the news story?
lol the rest of society, obviously.
ohhhh so if the victim is society (like the woman), then is "society" being blamed, or trump?
see how your analogy falls apart now, or not yet?
:p trump didn’t make jerusalem the capital of israel, it has been the capital since 1949. what trump did was acknowledge it as the capital.
the first pillar of the plo was retaking jerusalem, the second was using jerusalem as the base for wiping israel off the map, the third was killing off all jews worldwide.
trump acknowledging jerusalem as israel capital and placing our embassy there means the us will never support a peace plan that involves giving all of jerusalem to the pseudo nation palestine.
after 25 years of peace talks palestine as yet to make a single concession in the name of peace in the swipe of a pen trump made them concede jerusalem and also said very loudly that the us conceded that israel has a right to exist as a nation.
the creed of palestine is that israel has no right to exist until the arab nations concede that israel has a right to exist then there will be no peace.
and seriously if we let our foreign policy be dictated by the threat of violence then terrorism works.
well said - thank you.
any increase in terrorism and violence will be trump's fault though, because it was forseeable, he was warned by everyone around the world, but he did it anyways.
you keep repeating this all over the thread, and it's 100% horseshit.
by your logic, if i threaten to increase violence in response to *literally any policy i choose*, then any policy maker who defies me has blood on their hands.
that's so stupid it almost hurts to contemplate, and yet here you are arguing it.
nope, the logic is pretty clear: the violence was foreseeable, trump was warned this would happen by the entire world, he chose to provoke the violence anyways and therefore he is responsible for the provocation.
i'm not even sure what your twisted logic was trying to analogize there, but it's all on you buddy.
my logic is clear.
:) confirmed: you're either a troll or a high schooler confirmed: you're very triggered because logic isn't working for you today.
sorry, but that's just the truth of logic: trump is responsible for the consequences of his decision because those consequences were foreseeable and he had actual knowledge of those consequences, but he decided so anyways.
no escape.
isn't that just another way to get what you want in this world?
"watch out, and don't make us mad or we will hurt you".
it would be, were i a muslim.
i'm not though.
trump is a moron and an asshole, but this is not his fault.
the muslim world does not have the right to stop a sovereign nation from recognizing another sovereign nation's legitimate capital.
you have a problem with the muslim world, but not with trump making a terrible decision that he knew was going to ignite violence, and now has ignited violence.
everyone told him this would happen, but he chose to do it anyways.
he is to blame for his decision.
no doubt about it.
no, the muslim world is to blame.
i *do* have a problem with everything trump does.
even this decision, while i would have done the same, was made for completely wrong reasons.
trump essentially just listened to the douchebags in charge of the republican party who told them that he has to do this so that they could get the jewish vote, rather than actually sitting down and thinking about *why* the jews overwhelmingly vote for democrats.
&gt;no, the muslim world is to blame.
no, the muslim world isn't to blame for trump's decision... only trump is responsible for that.
maybe you meant the people who commit violence are responsible for their actions, which would mean criminal responsibility.
yes, no doubt.
however: 1- this doesn't mean the entire muslim world is criminally responsible for the acts of individuals 2- this still means trump is responsible for the political consequences (again, as opposed to the criminal acts themselves) of his political decision.
no, you don’t blame the president.
you blame the people perpetrating the violence.
you sound like you’re talking about a mad dog that can not control its actions.
of course you blame the president for the consequences of his decisions.
duh.
you’re going to blame the guy who moved a building, and not the people who commit violence because of we changed the address of our embassy?
that's just semantics, because you know that the true substance of his act is in the fact that it legitimizes israel's claims to jerusalem, thereby forcing generations of people who have lost their lives fighting for the city on the palestinian sides to accept those deaths as hopeless and in vain.
that sort of decision therefore provokes foreseeable violence that trump knew about, and willingly chose to provoke anyway.
everything we do provokes violence from them, because we are infidel kafir.
our drawing of breath is haram to them.
i don’t care what they think, and neither does the president, and neither should you.
they need to stop killing people and then i will care what they think.
"they're scum anyways!"
yeah, okay.
looks like you never wanted peace anyways.
hurrah for you.
meanwhile the civilized world is rightly concerned.
do you count people who think they have a divine obligation to kill infidels as civilized or not?
i've made it pretty clear - any decision you make that eradicates peace, leads to further violence - whether religious, or based on racism, economics, your hatred for the color blue, whatever - is the wrong decision.
your argument to the contrary is what makes you uncivilized.
it's interesting to me how fake news gets started but this article and your response seems textbook.
all the author had to do was play upon a reader's existing belief and the idea is planted.
it's actually pretty impressive in it's simplicity.
i guess they can't say that the restaurant is kosher anymore.
i think if we wan peace between israel and palestine we should just get the uk to rule it again.
so you all can screw it up again?
seriously, look in uk post wwi history.
they screwed the pooch in ways that makes the iraq war look amateur.
at least the palestinians and israelis could unite in hatred of something else rather than eachother?
history is full of people who angry at a, decide to attack b which has little to do with it.
seriously, he'd have more justification trying to beat up gal gadot, who served in the idf.
&gt; the bill, pre-filed thursday by sen. stephen meredith of leitchfield, earmarks 90 percent of those revenues to a newly created fund to reimburse the state’s medicaid program for money spent on tobacco-related illnesses.
i can get behind that.
they'll use it for a whole host of other shit, though.
of course they will.
there will be conveniently ambiguous language strewn throughout the while thing typical rich people.
the typical thing that happens is funding from other sources is reduced by the same amount.
sounds like kentucky bill, that ol' rascal.
kentucky bill, sworn enemy of florida man to put things in comparison by context... * the state of new york has a tax of $4.35 a pack.
new york city adds an additional $1.50, so cigarettes in nyc have $5.85 in taxes added per pack.
* massachusetts is $3.51 in taxes per pack.
* rhode island is $3.50 in taxes per pack.
* connecticut is $3.40 in taxes per pack.
* hawaii is $3.20 in taxes per pack.
* washington state is $3.025 in taxes per pack.
* minnesota is $2.90 in taxes per pack.
* vermont is $2.75 in taxes per pack.
* new jersey is $2.70 in taxes per pack.
* wisconsin is is $2.52 in taxes per pack.
* alaska, arizona, maine, maryland, michigan, washington d.c. are all $2.00 in taxes per pack.
* kentucky is currently 39th, at $0.60 in taxes per pack (soon to be $1.60, tying it with pennsylvania for 21st).
* the cheapest is missouri, at $0.17 in taxes per pack.
cheapest is missouri?
really?
what about virginia?
i live in md but its pretty well known that va has some of the lowest taxes on cigs since they are made there as well as still being a tobacco producing state.
according to the net the tax is $0.30... so not the cheapest but pretty close.
kentucky has kept it low for the tobacco farming industry, i'd imagine.
now that bourbon has kind of become the state's bread and butter, i can see why they'd tighten the belt on the smokers.
is there not a tax on it already?
if there is it isn't much.
can get a pack for like $5 there.
there is, but it's pretty small.
the tobacco industry held a lot of power here for a very long time.
if they want to curb teen smoking and or tobacco use, they should legalize marijuana.
that way the tobacco farmers can switch crops, still make a livelihood, and not be giving people cancer.
i don't think having teens switch from smoking cigs to weed would help anything.
it would lower the burden of health problems on the state.
you know, a conservative fiscal move.
its not great but it would be a net benefit.
cigs are just far more cancerous and addictive.
say what?
it doesn't matter if you smoke tabacco or pot you are still inhaling vapor produced by the burning of a carbon based material.
both do horrible damage to your lungs.
smoke is smoke and regardless of its source it is bad for you.
frequency of use is a big factor tho.
people aren’t smoking a pack of joints everyday.
also marijuana can be easily consumed by methods other than smoking.
thank you!
this is the most frustrating thing to explain to people.
some think that smoking marijuana is perfectly fine because it’s not tobacco but fail to realize smoking is bad for you in general.
i'm just trying to figure out what ky will do when tax revenue from cigarettes falls.
there's other uses for marijuana besides smoking it, which if ky wants to shore up their state budget, should be taken into account.
the $266 million it's supposed to generate doesn't seem like enough to offset the cost of smoking related illness.
why should it completely offset the cost of smoking related illnesses?
it's not like that is completely paid for by the government.
that would be called socialized medicine.
if smokers are using medicare to cover their smoking related health issues, then government is paying for it.
"if smokers are using medicare to cover their smoking related health issues, then government is paying for it."
no - taxpayers are paying for it.
does every smoker have medicare?
smokers are disproportionately lower income.
people on medicade are disproportionately lower income.
there for smokers are disproportionately on government provided healthcare.
but i ask again, why should this tax cover all of the costs of tobacco-related illnesses?
are you asking why tax on a tobacco product should cover the costs of tobacco related illnesses?
do you prefer that income tax covers it?
no, i am asking why it needs to cover ***all*** the costs.
am i speaking fucking swahili here, or what?
because tobacco causes **all** of the smoking related illnesses.
people on government insurance with smoking related illnesses has to be paid for somehow.
choice is either income tax or tobacco tax.
but the people on government insurance with smoking related illnesses do not make up **all** the costs of smoking related illnesses, and the lion's share falls to individuals and insurance companies.
just like you don't pay for the cost of all auto-related deaths, injuries, and property damage in the tax of buying a car; auto, life, and health insurance companies and the individual do.
guess we should start taxing junk food for all the strain obeisity related illness has on the healthcare system too.
let's start taxing needles also for all the iv drug user related illnesses we have, oh and cars for all those car crash injuries.
i agree with taxing cigarettes, tax them until they become as expensive as they are in new zealand ($50 a pack) and see it all transition to the black market entirely unregulated.
if the private insurance companies and medicare want to tax smokers then let them - which i believe they do charge higher premiums anyway.
it's not like you have universal healthcare where everyone's paying for each other i'd be all for taxing the crap out of junk food and fast-food.
i think the main idea of taxing cigarettes (at least in australia and new zealand) is to make them too expensive to eventually buy.
i don't know what the deal is in america but here they tax like 5% a year and it's already breaking everyone's wallets and making them quit i believe the point should be shifting the burden of the increased medical costs back to the people making the poor lifestyle choices.
should probably just tax the cigarette companies directly for selling such an addictive product.
most people start smoking in their early teens when their decision making is poor and they just want to experiment.
by the time they're an adult they are hooked and have little choice but to continue smoking.
it isn't all these peoples fault, granted they do hold some accountability definitely.
if heroin was legal would you tax heroin addicts who have no choice in quitting or would you just tax the fuck out of companies selling it to cover the costs
first time that's ever happened.
today or this week?
what time is it?
he must not have been willing to share.
i thought protocol required the money be entered into evidence before officers could help themselves to it.
maybe that's why he's being accused.
this will be unpopular, but get this... let's say you work at a job where a lot of the public hates you, some people actively try to kill you, and worse it's for the government.
you've played all your cards right but you're still just getting by like everyone else... now it seems tempting, right?
i assure you that this is probably the first time he did this but he's been on busts where he's seen at least 50x that amount.
poor corey - first he was used and abused, then he was not taken seriously and treated like a laughing stock for years.
the guy has taken a lot of abuse, i hope this vindication will finally help him to find some kind of happiness or peace and he can live a productive life henceforward.
he won't.
how can he trust people after what they have all done to him?
i feel so bad for the guy.
i heard him in an interview this past summer (before all these scandals came out) and he said michael jackson was the nicest most honorable person in the entertainment industry.
i'm starting to believe him and think that maybe these other fucks casted shade on michael to keep all the attention out of their closed doors.
apparently these tapes were in with the michael jackson case evidence.
i guess he tried to tell them that mj was fine but if they really wanted to catch some pedophiles then here’s a list.
poor guy.
naming pedophiles during an investigation into it and he still wasn’t taken seriously.
adds a lot of context on why he was so hesitant to drop names wow this is history changing.
a small minute part in the scheme of things but truly big in my life.
crazy i bet most if not all of the people who helped cover this up for who knows who in hollywood at that police department are retired so nothing will happen.
it took something this huge to finally kick hollywood in the ass to do something, i mean roman polanski was/is basically revered in hollywood like he is some kind of outlaw hero.
hollywood is a town that chews young people up like logs being put in a wood chipper, sometimes someone good comes out the other side but mostly they are just shredded and end up different people.
i'd be really surprised if anyone involved thinks they were involved with a cover-up.
i work in the entertainment industry and also teach a university class here and there on the side.
about a year ago a former student confided abuse to me.
i reported it, and several more students came to me and then the floodgates opened and suddenly i was making a documentary.
i'm not a documentary filmmaker at all so the whole thing has been harrowing.
in the beginning i was just listening and collecting evidence toward finding the "bad guys."
and while there were some definite shitty people involved i found that the most egregious, long-lasting wrong-doing was done by people who were just avoiding conflict.
it may seem weird to consider looking the other way on abuse or death or rape as avoiding conflict but that's exactly what it is when you're employed by the system where these incidents happen.
so a person comes to you and tells you their story and shows you the proof, well that person is an outsider.
conflict would be suddenly identifying with them and this abstract idea of "good" or "right and wrong."
so instead you put them through the procedures in place that you know aren't fair.
you file them away.
you look in the other direction.
maybe you rationalize how it was their fault or rationalize why you had to what you did.
everyone does this as a way of building a wall between themselves and other people's pain.
homeless people are just junkies.
rape victims are liars or had it coming.
soldiers knew what they signed up for.
in the case of my documentary i was startled that so many sports fans absolutely hated hearing about some student athlete being exploited.
hated it.
and not hated as in they wouldn't tolerate the injustice, hated it because it was bringing reality into their fantasy and because they have this image that the kids are doing their dream jobs and how dare they complain and look at this spoiled kid and that kid who doesn't have to go to class and yada-yada-yada.
i hate sports but i was shocked by the hate people have for the actual athletes.
i even had a few professors and staff members tell me that they weren't willing to stand up for victims because they were relying on the university to cover *their* kids' tuition.
this was mind-boggling to me; that a parent would look the other way on abuse so that their kid could one day enter that same dangerous territory.
but everyone thinks *their* kid won't be stupid enough to get hurt, that *their* kid won't fall into danger.
maybe they're right, maybe they're wrong.
but i've found in the past year that the best way of keeping a population in-line and not sticking up for each other is to take away social support systems so that every citizen is terrified of losing their paycheck.
edit: thanks for the gold.
i’m still interviewing current and former college athletes in socal.
i can protect anonymity so if anyone wants to talk they can send me a pm.
&gt; but everyone thinks their kid won't be stupid enough to get hurt, that their kid won't fall into danger.
revealing their belief it was the kids stupid fault if people can make themselves believe that the victims were at fault, then they can believe that they can prevent it from happening to themselves.
it's hollywood's unhealthy obsession with youth.
they are surrounded by a culture that says preteens modeling for calvin klein is edgy.
finding little children attractive has been normalized.
"millie bobby brown just grew up in front of our eyes.
(she's 13!)"
&gt; millie bobby brown i just looked at some pics of her, just on google search alone, and whoever posted them are clearly trying to portray her as an adult, and of course she's done the pics because she's 13 and doesn't fucking know any better.
doesn't this count as exploitation?
i pray these kids have parents that go to every event and filming studio with them polanski gets a ton of sympathy because he's a great filmmaker.
and, because his life story is enough to fuck anyone up.
he 1) lost all his family in the holocaust and as a result 2) was a teenaged prostitute in paris for years.
3) then his pregnant wife was murdered in their own home, along with five others by the manson family.
so, when you finally get down to the hot tub rape at jack nicholson's house and his thing for young girls, it just, in context to the time, didn't seem like that big of a deal.
at the time, the rape was treated like a party that got out of hand.
and, fitw, the agreed upon account of what happened there pales in comparison to any number of other 1970's rapy celebrity sex romps.
additionally, at the time, the sexual exploitation of explicitly underaged girls was a mainstream trope (see pretty baby, taxi driver, manhattan) so, there, are a ton of people over the age of 50 who think of him more like louis ck than, ya know, as a lifelong serial sexual predator.
public morality has radically changed.
it's why my niece thinks the john oliver/hoffmann thing is righteous.
but, my parents find the whole encounter baffling and unseemly.
edit: i'm not a polanski apologist.
dude is a predator and ought to be dealt with as such.
full stop.
let’s not even get started on woody allen.
i was a fan of his movies.
i can't seem to watch them anymore, its not even a conscious decision, it's a guttural response.
at this point i think every day corey isn't swinging from a rope is further proof that he's one resilient man.
he's lived a life of pain and mockery, in public.
the only video of him where he's sounded remotely normal is the one when he finally names an accuser on television, i think on dr. oz iirc.
it's like that scene in lord of the rings where the spell is broken on the king of rohan, like he had just come back to reality because now people were listening to him and he could get it off his chest.
very sad moment.
i always find it shocking when people still think jackson is guilty.
most evidence and testimonies have been dismissed or retracted.
so heartbreaking.
this is the worst thing corey had to say about jackson: &gt;feldman stressed in his interview with bashir that jackson never molested him or touched him improperly and that there was no sexual contact between them.
but he said he has re-evaluated his friendship with jackson and has concluded that there were things that happened in their relationship that were inappropriate and wrong.
&gt;"if you consider it inappropriate for a man to look at a book of naked pictures with a child that's 13 or 14 years old -- then your answer would be yes."
&gt;feldman says he had such an encounter at jackson's home when he says they stopped there on the way to disneyland.
"we went to his apartment, and i noticed a book that he had out on his coffee table.
the book contained pictures of grown men and women naked.
and the book was focused on venereal diseases and the genitalia."
feldman said the singer sat down with him and explained the photos to him.
&gt;feldman said, "i was kind of grossed out by it.
i didn't think of it as a big deal.
and for all these years, i probably never thought twice about it ... but in light of recent evidence ... i have to say that if my son was 14 years old -- 13 years old, and went to a man's apartment that was 35, and i knew that they were sitting down together talking about this, i would probably beat his ass."
&gt;in 2001, feldman and jackson had a falling out.
at the time, feldman told the press the rift had nothing to do with child abuse allegation that continued to dog jackson.
he actually explained later that the book was about skin diseases.
michael famously had two, vitiligo and discoid lupus.
he used to collect old medical books about skin diseases and i guess that's one of them he had laying around.
so it wasn't like a book on stds, though i did find it funny that anyone would think a predator would groom children with "sex is gross and will kill you" photos.
&gt; guess he tried to tell them that mj was fine but if they really wanted to catch some pedophiles then here’s a list.
sounds like they didn't want to catch "some pedophiles".
they wanted to catch mj.
since his information wasn't helpful in that regard, it was shelved.
exactly.
they weren’t trying to solve a crime, they were trying to arrest someone.
it's really heart breaking if you thinking about it in the context of both of them being molested at different points in their lives.
imagine a young feldman telling jackson what had happened to him and jackson just hugging him and being like "it'll be alright, man.
let's go ride the rides at my private disney world and forget about life for awhile."
this.
me 10 years ago totally thought mj was a pedo.
now i don't trust any actors/hollywood people except corey feldman and weird al can't forget terry crews and tom hanks.
i just want tom hanks unsullied.
bit late for [that](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3263904/?ref_=nv_sr_1) isn't it?
i’m still laughing.
i was nervous to click on that *dear god* god damn it.... slow clap stick keanu in that list too and i'm with you.
and bryan cranston.
and bob odenkirk.
goddammit, of anyone accused odenkirk i will die inside.
and keanu if weird al turns out to be a moleste` i am gonna be so sad.
&gt; moleste` is that french for 'touching people'?
i never thought he was.
i thought he had a mental illness that made him act that way.
it's sad; he probably died thinking the world hates him i'm not aware of any evidence that mj was sexually abused as a child, but he was certainly emotionally abused and probably physically abused.
his father was [a notorious bully](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joe_jackson_(manager\)#public_image), and a lot of mj's body image issues seem to have stemmed from that (his dad made fun of his "big" nose all the time, and he grew up to get plastic surgery to get rid of it.)
the mental illness question is something else entirely, that there's been a lot of speculation on and it's something we'll never really know for sure.
mark geragos absolutely insists that mj was innocent.
now, geragos was his attorney so of course said that but jackson is long dead now and geragos still gets quite animated about it and even says he left his own son to hang around mj's house that's how unconcerned he was.
and i would add geragos doesn't always talk in such terms about people he has defended who were guilty.
geragos by all accounts is a pretty decent person and i believe him.
he is a constant guest on the adam carolla podcast, and i just get the vibe that he's honest...for an attorney at least.
this is my take on the whole mj thing.
his childhood was taken from him.
he lived his adult life with every other adult treating him like some exhibit at the zoo.
he never had friends because they all treated him differently.
guess who didn't?
kids.
they had no idea who the fuck he was.
all they knew was that he had toys and was a nice guy and wanted to have fun with them.
on the surface that sounds creepy as fuck but what about someone who still wants to have a childhood and can't find anyone his own age to do it with?
we may look down on it because we always think someone has ulterior motives but what if the person was actually genuine?
what if mj was just a sweet, innocent, awesome guy who loved to play with toys and make kids happy?
take out all the preconceptions and it looks a lot different.
tl;dr: mj was fucked up due to his upbringing.
it made him yearn for a childhood.
he had the money to do it.
he did it.
people thought he was a perv.
he wasn't actually a perv.
wanting to hang out with kids is not creepy.
women do it all the time.
i request to babysit my friend's kids just so i can hang out with them since i don't have my own.
i also teach children at a museum.
kids are excited and accepting and fun to be around.
it refreshes me to be around children and helps my depression.
i wish men didn't have to worry about looking creepy just because they want to hang out with kids.
we need good role models for our children, both male and female.
i love playing around with kids.
i think it stems from memories of my uncle who used to always chase us around the yard and throw us around when me and my cousins were growing up.
he was a goofball and i remember how much fun i always thought that was and now i try to do the same whenever there's an opportunity.
i have two daughters of my own and at gatherings i'm usually off playing with the group of kids instead of adulting with the other adults.
i'm in pretty good shape so i can throw them around in the air and run around quite a bit without getting too tired, plus i count it towards a workout.
i'd like to believe my and the other kids will remember those times like i remember my childhood, running around with my uncle and cousins.
my husband stayed home with our daughter for her first three years while i worked.
he only actually got the cops called on him at the playground once, but there was never a time when people were like, "oh look, there is a good father".
like, wtf?
expecting dads to not interact with their children is pretty fuckin' unhealthy as a societal norm.
amen drunky!
i love staying with my kids.
they wanna have friends over?
heck yeah!
let's just out the nerf guns, xbox, whatever, and have some fun.
life is too short for serious "adult" stuff all the time.
plus kids are way more honest than most adults i have met.
i think that was the problem.
michael had such a terrible childhood (joe jackson, may he burn in hell) so no one really knew what to think.
yes this is a man who had a terrible childhood, and was damaged because of it.
the question was how far did that damage go and how did it manifest itself?
everybody knew michael was acting out the childhood he never had, and that he truly, genuinely enjoyed making children happy.
but during all of the fun and games, did things ever get inappropriate?
i’m pretty sure a bunch of us did some things during sleep overs in our childhood, that was innocent as children, but would be considered vile if it was between a child and adult.
imo i don’t think people considered michael a marauding child predator luring children to his rape den, i think people were just concerned about his child-like behavior.
was he an adult enjoying the fun of childhood, or was he delusional?
was he a grown man who believed he was 8-12 years old again?
he was a recluse.
no one knew where the line was getting drawn.
was he just enjoying the pure joy of being around children, or was he a child himself in his mind, with all of the experimenting, developing crushes, and learning about your body that many people went through in childhood?
like i said, for many of us it was innocent behavior between kids, but it would be unacceptable between a child and adult.
so when the accusations came out, people didn’t have to reach far to imagine michael doing these things.
i mean by the time he died, michael had gone from a young black child with a large nose, to something resembling a nightmarish mannequin.
he was obviously damaged, and that is what made the stories so easy to believe.
edit: i would also like to publicly say, because for years i believed michael did touch those kids, that i now believe michael never touched a child.
with everything coming out about pedophiles in power and how rampant is, i truly believe joe jackson whored michael out to further his dream of wealth, and i couldn’t imagine michael touching children after what he most likely went through.
i would also like to take this time to say fuck joe jackson.
fuck joe jackson.
i refuse to call joe jackson a sociopath because that implies somewhat that he wasn’t fully aware of what he was doing.
sociopathy is to empathy, what aspergers is to social norms.
extremes sociopaths do not develop empathy, joe jackson knew exactly what he was doing and did it anyway.
i hope his ring of hell involves hitler, a pineapple, and hemorrhoids i'll never forget geraldo rivera, who has been named as a rapist and who has confessed to a sickening amount of harassment bordering on sexual assault, yelling at michael jackson and calling him a freak after jackson was found not guilty.
don't worry.
i guarantee history will be kinder to michael jackson than to geraldo rivera.
according to some sources the allegations against jackson just destroyed him personally.
that's when he basically stopped taking care of himself and drinking and eventually drugs.
the pain killer addiction started with the pepsi concert explosion in his face.
i feel sorry for all the times i made fun of michael when he was still alive.
by now it's pretty established that michael jackson most likely never assaulted kids, it's just that it's not common knowledge.
it's really shitty how that whole thing got started, a father was so jealous of mj's gratitude towards his son and family that he made his son lie and say he was molested so he could get a nice payout.
i don't call that jealousy, i call that greed.
i wish michael was still alive.
i suspect he was the way he as from abuse as well.
and i don't really believe he harmed anyone.
he was raised a jehovah's witness and used to listen to his brothers and father screw fans in his hotel room.
it's a little traumatic to think your family is going to burn in hell.
also, his brothers teased him and called him ugly.
so we know where the plastic surgery fixation came from.
tbf, jehovah's witnesses don't believe in hell.
so he would've just thought his father and siblings would be mercilessly killed by god in armageddon and left to rot and be eaten by birds, along with most of the human population.
which is much better than hell ^/s source: former witness here this song's message is often missed.
one of his greatest hits imo.
https://youtu.be/qnjl6nfu__q i heard the first accusation against mj was a scam by some hollywood dentist guy, and people jumped onto the bandwagon after he got a big payout?
i may have heard wrong.
it's heartbreaking but i have to agree.
he can't go back to a "normal life", he's never had such a thing.
i'm sure he has enough in the bank to buy a modest home somewhere quiet, but then what would he do?
the only thing that will bring feldman peace at this point is justice for his friend, who's death/suicide has clearly damaged him personally.
when you've been through shit like that, nothing brings you peace.
christopher ameruoso, haim's neighbor for a year, said haim sometimes could be seen wandering around the complex, "looking for companionship, looking for friends".
:( i still see people on the movies subreddit who don't believe him.
it blows my mind, this dude has been saying the same thing for decades.
why would he spend so much time on this if it weren't true?
[deleted] he's still getting used by all of those who only want to interview him for their ratings.
dr oz for example.
once a commodity, always a commodity.
hopefully not true in his personal life.
this is why we need to punish rich criminals like every other criminal in america.
he was silenced by wealth.
he was silenced by the santa barbara pd because they were mainly focused on michael jackson and didn’t give two shits about anything but that.
corey was pretty much stating that they’re looking into the wrong individual and need to go after the real creeps.
they said nope and sent him on his way.
this is why i have always supported him.
he and so many other individuals who are abused aren’t taken seriously and need all the support they can get.
like why would he lie about him and haim getting molested?
there’s no reason.
hopefully after all of this he can start getting roles he deserves in movies and shows again too.
he deserves happiness and success.
sounds like the police dept.
didn't want to find this evidence until the pressure got too heavy.
edit: thanks.
it's always the most flippant, offhand comments that blow up.
also, i did misread.
i thought it was the same department, but somehow, this seems even worse.
"we always thought that drawer labeled 'corey feldman's 1993 audio files naming alleged sexual predators' was a joke!"
"put it with the others" *top* men prefer bottom boys "rape drawer" ?
it was labeled, “spin doctor’s mix,” which is why no one listened to it.
that right there is a tale of corruption &amp; intrigue.
i taped over the spin doctors.
i would listen to that in a heartbeat little miss can't be wrong... social experiment!
barbara walters got to them.
“you’re ruining an industry!” or whatever baba wawa said, looking away in disgust.
i think she said he was "damaging" the industry.
either way, she's a damn dirty sexual assault apologist.
barbara walters and matt lauer both epitomize the sort of horrible human being who will always stick to the script.
celebrity puff pieces and softball critiques are only interrupted by rare takedowns, the latter always devoted to emphasizing norms.
both careers were exceptional in their mediocrity.
their ability to always cleave toward the banal and vapid when a moment for serious social critique emerged was absolutely top notch.
this is how such relentlessly bland people became extremely wealthy superstars in american culture.
**those jobs are actually about missing the point so that viewers will follow suit.
** barbara walters is the *worst.
* i remember on 2011 or 12 she did an interview of bashir al-assad.
she completely tossed him easy softball questions.
i lost all respect for her.
get your hands off me you damn dirty sexual assault apologist!
you'we *dam*aging the industwy!
you've actuawwy done it!
you damaged it!
you maniacs!
between walters and "it wasn't *rape* rape" roman polanski ally whoopie goldberg, i'm surprised the view isn't putting together rapist support funds.
don't forget "domestic &amp; sexual violence is okay when committed by a woman" sharon osborne.
if you kill hollywood, what are they going to prattle on about?
she's a company man to the bitter end.
you misread.
the la pd are the ones who originally "lost" it.
the sheriff's department in santa barbara is a different police department.
they found a copy of the original tapes that they had send to la pd.
basically, they just threw la under the bus by locating a copy of evidence la police had and purposely destroyed.
but don't get too gitty, la will of course refer any wrong doing to internal affairs and some half retired guy in his 60s might get a few extra days of paid vacation.
the problem here is that police losing the original tapes and not investigating doesn't get around the statute of limitations.
the people he named are still immune to criminal or civil charges.
at most this allows corey better protection from libel suits.
it is up to the public to shame anyone he named, that is about it.
i think you misread.
santa barbara sheriff's office took the original complaint, and has since turned over their recently "found" evidence to lapd.
&gt;the former child actor claimed in october that he had given the names of sexual predators in hollywood to the santa barbara county sheriff’s office in 1993 during their investigation into michael jackson's molestation charges.
the sheriff’s office denied those claims, saying they had no records of feldman revealing such information, until now.
&gt;santa barbara county sheriff’s office public information officer kelly hoover told fox news on tuesday night in an emailed statement, “following the recent inquiries into the sheriff’s office interview of mr. feldman in 1993, the santa barbara county sheriff’s office conducted an additional review for any stored items remaining from the michael jackson investigation.
in a container which included the original reports from the investigation, the sheriff’s office located some detective working copies of audio recordings made during the investigation.
a copy of mr. feldman’s interview was located.
the recording is being turned over to the los angeles police department.
[you seen street kings with keanu?
](https://youtu.be/jdhjrd4p9rs) i fucking loves that movie.
“us!!
we’re straight fucking nightmares!” before ayer and keanu came along it was going to be sean penn as the dirty cop directed by oliver stone feel bad for him.
money talks and bullshit walks.
i hope heads roll over whoever never brought these tapes to light sooner, like back in 1993. that’s 24 years.
think of all of the kids that may have been saved had those cops taken corey seriously.
&gt;fox news had originally reached out to the sheriff’s office in october at which time they responded, “we are aware of the statements that mr. feldman is making regarding an investigation in 1993. our records do not indicate that he named any suspects."
santa barbara sheriffs are assholes, anyway.
it's no surprise they either lost the tapes, or (more likely) keep shitty records about things that don't fit their agenda.
i love how they got caught with this.
they want to keep it quiet so they 'lose' the tapes.
now, with all this public attention, they either have to find the tapes and look like dummies, or say they really did lose them and look like even bigger dummies.
i'd like to think that there aren't too many that were present on the force in 1993 who are still there today.
maybe there was enough turnover that someone finally thought to check for the tapes and see if they could make things (closer to) right.
there's a lot that still needs to be answered for, but this is at least a step in the right direction.
is there proof who watched them?
covering up a crime is a crime and if the us gave a shit about justice they would also indict the cops.
well, obstructing justice, if that's what you mean, is a crime.
but, not pressing charges over any and all accusations could hardly be automatic obstruction.
intentionally losing evidence is a crime.
collusion between multiple people would be conspiracy which is also a crime.
proving that is the hard part.
rather strange that time left him out from the people that spoke up against sexual assault in hollywood.
yeah since he's one of the main ones and done more than almost anyone.
but he has been trying for more than just 2017. i think the saddest part, really, is that he didn't do it when it was the "trend".
which is sick, if you think about it.
the same culture that is now trending, exposing these slimeballs across the world, has all but rejected him because his timing was bad.
and he took shit for it for all these years.
it's fucked man, and it hints at a newer, less understood problem.
this whole idea of something "trending" and crossing the world like a mexican wave is equal parts fascinating as it is terrifying.
yup.
trending equals clicks, which equals dollars.
all the outlets doing reporting now are only after the click.
none of this in new, molestation in hollywood (don't forget jimmy savile and the bbc either) goes back generations.
feldman says he found a cassette copy that was made for him.
&gt; so now the police r saying they hav a copy of my 93 interview, but they cant release it!
well guess what....so do i!
i was rummaging thru my garage &amp; came upon the old cassette copy the sbpd made 4 me!
i had never released it, but now i will!
maybe theres still hope.... https://twitter.com/corey_feldman/status/938526073305776128 corey wrote this in his autobiography years ago: &gt; **the audiotapes have long since been leaked to the press—i clearly stated that michael never touched me, never acted in any way inappropriate.
what’s incredible about them, however, is that i admitted that i had been molested; i even named my abuser.
the sergeant peppering me with questions, deborah linden, breezed right past that.
she didn’t seem the least bit interested.
** corey also notes that after being drugged and molested by one man: &gt; **i was shattered, disgusted, devastated.
i needed some normalcy in my life.
so, i called michael jackson.
michael jackson’s world, crazy as it sounds, had become my happy place.
** it makes me want to break down weeping to think that michael jackson was the one protecting the kids from the abusers all along.
why do you think the entertainment industry and the media came down on mj so hard?
they saw him as a threat and needed to discredit him early, often and loudly.
make a saint look like a sinner and vice versa is what mass media does.
well hold on here, wouldn't this invalidate the statute of limitations as this means he made a statement very soon after the fact?
you'd hope.
how is there a statute of limitations on child rape anyway?
that's absurd.
from what i can tell, there is a blanket "statute of limitations" on crime in general with an exception for homicide.
the fact that rape of any kind isn't an exception seems to be an oversight as until recently rape really wasn't reported years later.
iirc california changed that in response to cosby's allegations however that change is not retroactive the other issue is that until relatively recently dna evidence wasn't a thing, so you were depending primarily on personal recollection of events.
memory is notoriously untrustworthy and susceptible to suggestion, especially the further back an incident happened.
a statute of limitations made sense back when these kinds of crimes were he said, she said affairs.
now people need to get the right politicians in office to get them updated for modern society.
i’m not sure, but it seems it would.
i think new evidence/rediscovery of old evidence should be enough to give it the classification of an ongoing case.
no, charges have to be brought before the deadline, not just accusations.
i always heard as a kid that kid stars ended up a bit whacky when they grow up in hollywood.
i guess we all know why now.
sadder than i had imagined.
yeah.
growing up it was always thought "oh they are spoiled so they become alcoholics, drug addicts, etc."
now i am thinking a lot of it could be due to molestation.
this honestly amazes me.
just a year ago everyone said he was a weird dude making shit up.
people said there were not any issues with child rapists in hollywood.
well it’s now their day of reckoning and the suppressed voices will be heard.
yep, and now somehow everybody says "everybody knew already, it's not news..." hypocrites... what matters is that proof on tape, no rumors or allegations, that is news.
if shawn and gus were there they wouldn't have had any problems finding the files.
this will be the plot for tomorrow's movie edit: for those who don't have usa, it usually shows up next day for sale on amazon video you know that's right... c'mon son!
i’m psychic detective shawn spencer, this is my partner, charles in charge don't you mean lavendar goomes?
or me?
are you telling me there's a psych movie and it airs tomorrow?
you know that's right tomorrow night on usa!
how the heck can i watch the show show?
i never saw the last season.
pirate it?
your local library can get you the dvd's you can buy it on amazon or dvd.
thanks for the reminder!
i am shawn spencer, psychic detective for the santa barbara police department, and this is my associate, ovaltine jenkins don't you mean original g-string aka the crowd pleasa ?
is this ironic?
: &gt; feldman, 46, had claimed in a today show interview with matt lauer that he “sat down and i gave them names.
they're on record.
they have all this information.” it's so disturbing to watch that interview again after the allegations came out against matt lauer.
he was so aggressive towards corey for no reason at all.
creep.
well, it wasn't for no reason... someone on here suggested a while back that the people who go hardest against certain kinds of offenses are actually perpetrators of those offenses.
starting to look true imo.
just like all those anti-gay politicians that turn out to be gay themselves i forgot his name and the exact joke, but there's a comedian who had a joke around all the politicians who were so adamantly against homosexuality actually being gay themselves - like maybe the thing we hate the most is who we really are.
so he was afraid of actually being a giant spider.
matt lauer heard to mumble in reply "ok, have to get these guys on the phone" matt lauer heard to mumble “sheeeeeeeeeiiit” barbra walters also told one of the cory’s (can’t remember if it was feldman or haim) that if they broke the story they’d be “damaging the industry” wow.
this was one of the biggest claims against him.
&gt; fox news reached out to corey feldman and the los angeles police department but did not receive comment.
all corey feldman's going to say is, "i told you so."
i hope corey tells them all to fuck off and writes a bestselling tell-all, naming names.
a bunch of sphincters in hollywood just tightened up.
and junk still fell out... "found" like they had been misplaced, and not intentionally squirreled away where nobody could find them.
interesting that he has always defended accusations against michael jackson with his only complaint being that michael abandoned their legitimate friendship.
michael was no doubt a victim himself well his childhood was basically having his dad beat him for missing a note and pretending to be asleep while his older brothers fucked groupies in the hotel rooms they shared.
it's because if you actually read about the case against michael it was all bullshit.
it was definitely odd that he held sleep overs with children, but both cases where he was accused were recanted by the children when they were adults and admitted that their parent / lawyer had coached them on what to say to the police.
there's even a phone recording of the child's father in the first case admitting that he was going to ruin michael's life with the things he'll make his son say and that he was going to get all of his money.
michael's estate is still worth a ton of money and you're telling me that out of all the hundreds of kids he had come over that it was only 2 kids if he had been molesting them?
literally every other kid they tried interviewing for sound bites at the time came to michael's defense.
he had a damn movie theater built to hospital level standards so terminally ill children could go to the movies safely.
all he cared about was making these kids lives better than his was.
i have heard it said several times that if the mj allegations had happened during the internet age, they'd have been shredded in seconds for the obvious money-grabs that they were.
i also read that they got into his porn collection and the only thing shocking about it was how vanilla and hetero it was.
i think there were claims of child pornography being found, but they turned out to be an art book with a painting containing cherubs.
basically.
some argue that he was already under fbi investigation for 10 years so there is no way he would keep evidence around.
they found some hetero porn usage online, but from what i've read he was not really that sexual of a person.
and i don't think there is anything wrong with that.
i don't think so either.
i read corey's book on a whim a few years back and i believe it.
mj was odd, that is true, but a pedophile?
no.
when someone is weird in ways that make them an easy target, damn right people are going to use their kids as money grabs.
it actually saddens me and makes me wonder if he wouldn't have been around longer had his image not been tarnished.
&gt; literally every other kid they tried interviewing for sound bites at the time came to michael's defense.
and some of the kids apparently even were saying "michael didn't but i can tell you who did!"
and they weren't interested in the criminals because they were after michael.
this should be the top comment.
all the child stars who were close to michael jackson never said a bad thing about him, but they are all coming out against other people in hollywood.
it's entirely possible that michael was actually protecting them.
macaulay culkin always said the accusations against michael were ridiculous, and hollywood sure enough left his career to rot too.
imagine that we find out that michael's mansion and park and everything were built for kids who were being abused and he basically was the one person kids hung around with to feel safe.
neverland ranch.
a place to get away from the creepy adults and other dangers of the world, and never grow up to become one of them.
odd coincidence that one of michael's best friends was a "lost boy".
the hero they needed and the one they deserved?
i'd be willing to bet on that very unconfirmed theory.
but i've read that real abusers in hollywood went after michael jackson because of his close relationship with corey feldman.
the genesis of this police questioning was the santa barbra pd trying to nail michael jackson on charges related to the chandler's accusations.
corey feldman didn't give the police the big scoop they were looking for, so they completely ignored his legitimate testimony about real predators.
people often simplify michael jackson's relationships with children as being a simple way of returning to his lost childhood, while it's true to a certain degree, michael was actually a very huge child's rights activist.
his relationships with emanuel lewis, corey feldman, macauley culkin, etc.
were premised on a desire to ensure that, as child stars, they were able to have fun times, enjoy childhood activities, and not always feel the pressure of working.
it's also why jackson had a strong relationship with elizabeth taylor - another celebrity with a childhood in the entertainment industry.
michael jackson also gave a very passionate speech at oxford in 2001 which reveals a lot about his philosophies on child welfare and goes into certain detail about his own childhood: https://youtu.be/-tdmiruhfpg well corey always said mj was good to him and didn't hurt him and iirc, he said he even protected him.
just imagine how much could have changed from then to now if the powers that be actually protected the people and did their fucking job that they swore to do that our tax money went towards.
24 fucking years!
imagine all the other stuff they "lose" and ignore.
our system is a fucking joke.
oh now they suddenly found them my, what an incredible lucky amazing fortunate coincidence.
my dad worked for defense contractors and the government.
people hiding documents that their superiors want destroyed is a total thing.
mostly done for career insurance reasons.
the suspicion by your superiors that you might have access to damaging information makes them leave you alone.
when things were paper you could pull the index sheet and the documents would 'disappear' put the index sheet back in or leave it where it'll be found and... absolutely possible that someone in the sheriff's department made sure it was kept.
it was in the big box labeled “hollywood sexual predators evidence: feldman.
file under f” in the “hollywood sexual predators evidence archive” section f of the “hollywood sexual predator case file evidence warehouse” that was originally an airplane construction facility.
so that's where indi left the ~~holy grail~~ ark.
it would have been nice to see him validated on the cover of time magazine... he's been telling this story for decades but apparently he's just too weird to put in their magazine or something?
&gt;so now the police r saying they hav a copy of my 93 interview, but they cant release it!
well guess what....so do i!
i was rummaging thru my garage &amp; came upon the old cassette copy the sbpd made 4 me!
i had never released it, but now i will!
maybe theres still hope.... from feldmans twitter just a while ago... how convenient.
i wonder who gave them the ok to find it.
the better question is i wonder who coerced them to lose it in the first place please tell me a **copy** of the recordings was handed over to the lapd, and santa barbara pd kept a copy!
and time magazine doesn't even mention him i wonder how all these people that openly mocked him for refusing to name them feel now?
i was to grow as him as an 'idol' so for the longest time i just thought he was a weird hollywood dude.
then in 2008 i got really into anything true crime and came across his accounts of being molested and abused.
ever since then when ever i see him in an interview, with everyone mocking him, i just feel sick.
grown men and women are the direct product of their childhood and traumas.
glad to see so many supportive comments here on reddit what sucks even more about this is that people always criticize victims of sexual abuse for not going to the police or telling anyone in law enforcement and corey did exactly that.
somehow it still got pushed aside.
his whole life could have been different if he had been taken seriously.
any reason why he wasn't on the cover of time magazine?
as a woman i would have found the cover even more empowering if there were men too.
it makes it seem like it's a women's movement he should be front and centre.
jesus christ... poor guy.
24 years.
24 years of being ignored after you sought help.
i've seen some people talk about how corey feldman is a douchebag now, i don't know much about it but maybe there's a reason for it, yeah?
if all this is true (which it may or may not be) then he was exploited since childhood and even when he asked for help then he got fucked again too.
i imagine that can have some negative effects on a person.
and if it does it's not entirely their fault.
about fucking time this poor dude is vindicated.
talk about a lost boy.
you can just tell this bloke has had a hard life , i never doubted him, the things he said were to "revealing or embarrassing or career damaging" to be anything but the truth , i'm glad he's finally being believed, also glad the police admitted thier mistake .
there's nothing worse than not feeling believed when you bare your soul , and tell all of the horrible "little secrets" for it to all be covered up.
hopefully they can put together a historic case but i know usa has limits on that think of this whenever you ask, "why did they wait so long to say anything?"
this poor man has been telling the same horrendous story from the beginning and has been ridiculed for it.
i hope he gets justice, better late than never.
it's a christmas miracle!
i'm curious, let's say that feldman had given the police all they needed to arrest somebody and nothing was done (perhaps due to lost evidence).
now the stature of limitation is more or less out of the window, so what happens?
information found, guilty parties known, but nothing because it's too late?
or will it be new evidence being found changing things?
or that evidence existed, but was lost, yet had the evidence been handled correctly then it would have led to arrests?
does that change anything or does this now go into the category of "too little, too late"?
they are gonna kill corey...he may just turn up overdosed or suicide'd i know it doesn't matter to corey personally, but i still feel like i should apologize to him.
i'm a couple years younger than he is, so all we ever heard was those crazy wild hollywood kids, so into drugs and out of control.
nobody ever even thought they were reacting to something horrible that was happening to them.
i wish i hadn't thought all those terrible things, and i'm glad that he at least is living to see some kind of consequences for his abusers.
(at least i hope he does.
we're there now as a society, right?
like, people who rape kids have consequences now?
that's a thing we're doing?)
fuck you, barbara walters.
you sick demented bat.
incase some do not know what i am referring to.
she called him a liar to his face when he mentioned it on the view.
i mean, ok, but it’s not like babies use their brains for a whole lot anyways.
they don’t even know how to read.
i bet you're a gynaecologist nope.
ass, nose, and throat specialist i can has be taken damage of brain of child time.
maybe how it was pollution?
they see.
they see.
when me president, they see.
they see.
end net neutrality.
not even pollution-damaged brains think that's a good idea.
better fix the babie's brain over polution.
probably all human brains are.
globally any top soil exposed after diesel engines went mainstream, have lead.
and the first, i think its 6 inches, of snow are not safe for consumption because of all the toxins it cleans out of the air.
but assuming stagnate air flow, you can eat the 7+ inches.
yes, babies shouldn't watch tv.
black carbon (soot) and other particulate pollution is the biggest enemy to humanity.
but we have an entire industry built around demonizing co2 that it takes a back seat in public awareness and governmental regulation.
it's really a travesty.
because you look at what happened in the uk where they phased out gas engines in favor of diesel engines (to lower their co2 imprint) and now they are dealing with more smog and particulate pollution a decade later.
untold millions are breathing that shit in on a daily basis.
good thing the current administration wants to get rid of those pesky regulations and the epa!
just to add to your point, they are also pro life, they care so much for the women, children and the less fortunate, as long as it doesn’t affect the “creation of jobs (profits)” .
epa it’s only there to destroy our economy and ‘merica.
good thing i'm only already born.
... then they grow up to become politicians.
if that were true all the chinese children would be brain damaged and they seem smart enough it's almost as if you didn't read the article and just posted your opinion blindly.
that saves em time from reading the article and then posting their opinion blindly anyway.
they're all stupid, they should revolt but are dumb and compliant
this is about the long game.
net neutrality supporters hit the streets and publicly protest where people will see them.
get attention.
telecoms have played the long game well.
net neutrality was codified as government policy in 2010 with the open internet order.
net neutrality was a gentleman's agreement for years before that.
verizon sued the fcc saying that they had no basis to do that.
title 2 as a public utility came about in 2015 as a result.
now, the telecoms have their guy, ajit pai, as the head of the fcc.
he has put all of his capital into repealing net neutrality.
the public comment period showed 98% of all human comments pro net neutrality.
pai said doesn't matter.
the attorney general of ny state is investigating the comment period and millions of robot comments against net neutrality.
the fcc and pai are stonewalling.
12 senators requested that the dec. 14th vote be delayed.
that is pressure!
pai refused and called net neutrality supporters "desperate."
pai is strong arming and not bothering to hide that the dec. 14th vote will end net neutrality.
there is even a poison pill saying that localities cannot pass net neutrality laws.
so, telecoms have local monopolies and we are beholden to them.
imagine the net where you cannot go to facebook without a charge or if netflix is blocked in favor of comcast streampix.
at &amp;t had a decision in their favor a few days ago where the ftc cannot regulate at &amp; t as an isp.
no net neutrality will mean total power and no oversight.
imagine how that would be.... the fcc will be sued post haste when the fcc repeals net neutrality.
it's a delaying action.
if the telecoms block sites, throttle netflix, etc., that will make people angry.
watch people go mental when they can't see their porn!
net neutrality is supported by over 70% of voters democrat and republican.
net neutrality supporters are trying to energize those people to demand a congressional solution.
well, shit... what can we do to stop this?
like where do we vote?
~~or build an army~~ edit: shit, wait.
if this passed it'd make it possible for your internet provider to block websites, right?
if that's possible what if the government can pass laws to block websites now that there's a platform to do it?
welcome to what's called "the slippery slope" this is exactly why this is so important.
if the majority of this country wants net neutrality and they steamroll everyone on this, it sets a new precedent.
isn't the "slippery slope" a fallacy?
or do people on say that when someone says something they agree with may become a slipper slope?
it's really hard to keep track of these things now.
i believe the fallacy is *assuming* everything will be a slippery slope.
some things truly are one though, so i think the term can still be used.
it's only a fallacy if the other party is using it as an argument.
edit: just so i'm not so snarky, slippery slope is a phenomenon borne out by history.
it began to be called a fallacy when it was used against certain progressive laws for fear they would take it too far.
so slippery slope is not an argument about what must logically follow.
it is essentially a statement that you do not trust the other person.
that's more on the philosophical side of whether or not it constitutes as a fallacy or not.
in the debate world, a slippery slope is a sneaky way of dismissing anything your opponent proposes without engaging their argument.
it's an obvious fallacy when extreme stretches are used.
imagine, you're running for office.
your opponent proposes to lower pollution by introducing a carbon tax based on the size of your car's engine.
you, having stayed up all night on a bender, weren't prepared and say "if we allow a carbon tax, what next?
taxing the air we breathe because the human heart is an engine and produces a carbon emission!"
you bypass your opponent's argument by introducing a crazy distortion of what they argued.
the concern that government, or other entities, will abuse the platform that killing net neutrality off provides them is not extreme whatsoever.
the patriot act is an example of this.
some feared it would introduce a slippery slope that would be detrimental to one's privacy.
the bigger fear was terrorism and, because of that, it passed.
at the time, the idea of mass persistent surveillance wasn't much a reality.
that was until social media became big and all government had to do was ask microsoft, apple, fb, or google.
while it's for "security" and people willingly gave this information by owning a pc, iphone, a fb profile, or a gmail account...we're still bothered by the loss of privacy on the government's perspective and the right to be forgotten by the entities maintaining this information.
given the behavior of government and conglomerates, it's no stretch of the imagination they'd abuse it because they have done so in the past.
we're not saying "the government has abused their power once, so we can't trust them to conserve our parks and wildlife."
we're saying "government overreach with legislating the internet has happened once before and we're concerned it's going to happen again with the death of net neutrality."
that is the way i take it to mean at least.
it doesn't need government interference to lead to harsh censorship.
the wealthy donors backing political parties can buy preferential treatment for their politics and pay to censor their opponents.
as soon as large infrastructure monopolies have the freedom to control what people see, wealthy political interests will start maneuvering to take advantage.
also called cable.
call your congress person and join a protest.
there's a dc protest on the 14th at the fcc.
i think that's all we can do now.
one problem: the fcc not regulating isps and preventing states from regulating them is, in short, unconstitutional.
the fcc, a federal department, regulates the internet right now.
if they decide to stop regulating it, then under the 10th amendment, which states that the powers not given to the federal government are left to the states, which can easily be interpreted as things not regulated by the federal government is left to the states.
it's a delaying action.
if it takes 4-5 years like title 2, many actors like the president and fcc commissioners change.
even in 2018, the house and senate could flip.
that would change things to folks who could be amenable to net neutrality.
it seems even the former fcc chairman believes ajit will fuck shit up.
https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/tom-wheeler-slams-ajit-pais-plan-to-kill-net-neutrality-rules/ so let's not even count that as being considerate of them doing.
even if it is unscontitutional they will still do it for as long as they can and got knows how slow the courts are doing things.
even if the courts work to revert it it will take months might even pass over a year before the whole thing is taken down and by then the damage will be long done.
hell they might even have made enough propaganda and supported corrupt politicians to kill healthcare by then.
i think this is all a push to elect more corrupt politicians and their ball game is to kill things such as our healthcare among other programs to fill their pockets as quick as possible.
wouldn't net neutrality be in force as long as a legal action was being pursued?
my view of pai's attitude is, "i make the rules, so try and stop me, i dare you."
the order that pai is pushing as a repeal reads like a christmas present to telecoms.
i bet that an isp lobbyist wrote that order.
not really accurate.
the 10th amendment has been interpreted by the supreme court as little more than a tautology.
that is, an obvious consequence of the federal government's enumerated powers.
when the constitution assigns specific powers to the federal government, it only stands to reason that all other powers do *not* belong to the federal government.
the federal government can and does preempt the several states on a variety of issues, and declining to regulate isps *in a particular manner* does not automatically mean that states are free to do so.
particularly where that state action would interfere with the federal government's action or purposeful inaction in that area.
thr federal government's net neutrality policy will not be upended by the 10th amendment.
how would this affect freedom of speech, what if he pushes this through and among blocking competitor web services, they also block access to sites where people complain about them or that people use for organization to fight back which could include reddit for example?
you now have to pay by the word to bash trump.
i'm about to take out a second mortgage.
&gt; net neutrality was a gentleman's agreement for years before that.
maybe you aren't talking about this far back, but... in the 90's (my mind is kinda hazy due to the fact that i was in college back then, but), i seem to recall that the reason isps didn't 'look' at the packets, was the slippery-slope that they could, potentially, be held responsible for the content (or that seemed to be the perception, true or not).
i.e.
one of their clients tx/rx child porn, or strong encryption to outside of us border, or mp3s... i guess this isn't a fear anymore, because of the size of the isp's effective monopolies... like ma bell, all over again, only now with 33% more regulatory capture!
thanks for you concise summary, well done.
&gt;maybe you aren't talking about this far back, but... in the 90's (my mind is kinda hazy due to the fact that i was in college back then, but), i seem to recall that the reason isps didn't 'look' at the packets, was the slippery-slope that they could, potentially, be held responsible for the content you can thank the patriot act and the war on terror for that change.
isps had to install packet monitoring technology.
leos and security angencies can secure warrants or get secret authorization under the patriot act to start snooping around in there.
isps resisted because of the cost.
they lost.
then they realized they could make more money by throttling stuff.
hence why we started battling for net neutrality.
edit.
to those claiming slippery slope fallacy, remember were going to lose netflix because of the war on terror.
pai and company are using the radio/tv broadcasting argument.
isps own all content sent on the networks used.
wrong.
the internet is a connect series of networks.
but the internet is like a road.
the isps may have the pavement, but none of the supplies, people or transports on that road are owned by isps.
net neutrality means i can get in my "car" and go anywhere i please on that net that i can access using the road.
the isps are saying since they have the road, all of the cars, supplies on that road are owned by them.
isps are saying that since they have the road, all the buildings, content, people, and everything in the surrounding counties are owned by isps as well.
that is a false argument.
the long game you say?
sort of like voting for a candidate for president that you might not like 100% but holds a valuable position on net neutrality?
too bad more people didn't play the long game november 2016. if they had, we wouldn't be talking about this.
both sides are the same though, so voting doesn't matter herp derp... tldr fcc is corrupt we need fcc to regulate the internet &gt; so, telecoms have local monopolies and we are beholden to them.
imagine the net where you cannot go to facebook without a charge or if netflix is blocked in favor of comcast streampix.
aren't there already laws in place to prevent anti-competitive practices such as this?
the ftc was ruled against last week.
they can't regulate at &amp;t. the fcc will not regulate.
so nope, nothing.
where are you protesting at?
its unfortunate that pai has already made up his mind.
even after thousands upon thousands of public comments that he himself asked for, he determined that none of them were vital to his decision.
asshole it was over 22 million complaints filed when i filed mine earlier.
you would think 22 million people complaining would be indicative of a problem, but no, verizon dollars run him.
but 300 million didn't complain so majority rules, right?
/s edit: i wasn't actually serious terrible logic, i work at a massive telecom and i know the damage this legislation is going to do.
(i actually already saw some of the damage live back before the fcc regulated it through tom wheeler.
now it's going to be way worse than before.)
do you know if or when any of this will backfire on the telecoms?
it's just going to make life miserable for everyone, create artificial congestion points, artificial throttling (between even the big telecoms.)
this happened a few years ago with comcast artificially limiting netflix traffic to extort more money out of them.
so every telecom is going to try to cut each other's throats between every asn and switch/router/netflow systems and end users are going to suffer as a result.
it also paves the way for prioritized traffic, which could harm small businesses and startups that want to try to compete with bigger corporations that can pay for 'priority' traffic.
it's unnecessary, we all get shittier service for higher prices, and it's a cash grab straight up.
just all bad for everyone involved (except the big telecoms who get to price gouge.)
how much money do you think he stands to make?
can’t we all just pitch in a couple bucks to make that money hungry asshole go away and leave our shit alone.
all that will do is double his take.
he has wealthcock all the way down his throat, he worships that rich dick.
we don’t matter.
it's unfortunate but thousands upon thousands of dollars speak louder.
why don't thousands of people go to his house and take a shit on his lawn together.
seriously, do that once a day for a week and it's bound to make an impact.
do we have enough law enforcement to stop 50k people from shitting?
there is only one way to find out.
not his house.
go to the houses of the ceos of big isps.
they're the ones running the show.
we can hit a new house each day.
a roaming band of shitters.
they’ll just underpay someone to clean it up.
they need to fear for their safety.
he didn't make up his mind, he received the winning bid for his allegiance.
ajit pai paid up his mind.
he is obeying wealth.
this is why he doesn’t deserve to feel safe in our society.
someone needs to dox his ass.
why not like comcast centers, att stores etc?
i presume this is because ajit pai was a lawyer at verizon.
his title, as stated on the [fcc's website](https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership/ajit-pai), was associate general counsel.
that same page shows that, after graduating law school in 1997, he held 8 jobs over the next 15 years before being appointed commissioner at the fcc in 2012, where he stayed for the 4 year term, before being appointed chairman in january 2017. i don't know how much influence his 3 years at verizon 14 years ago has had on his philosophy today.
however, it is a point of contention as he is the only member of the fcc leadership to have worked directly for a telecommunications company.
other redditors have hypothesized that after net neutrality would die, he'd return to verizon for work and receive a hefty pay hike for helping them out.
more than a hefty pay raise.
they'll be beholden to him, they will be erecting statues of him at headquarters.
can you imagine that extremely punchable face as a 15 foot bronze statue?
yuck.
pull them down.
fuck, he might just get promoted to ceo.
he runs for president in 2024 because ajit pai used to work for verizon.
*ashit pile *a shit pie seriously, net neutrality already doesn't apply to cell service.
that's why they able to offer deals that don't use your data if you're using certain websites.
... are you being serious?
verizon is an isp, the data plan you pay for grants you access to the internet.
with this passing, they now have the right to block, slow, or fast-lane whatever apps, websites, and services pay them most.
all i'm saying is that it isn't that different from what wireless providers are already allowed to do.
data caps combined with some sites not using your data is something that is allowed already and goes against the principles of net neutrality.
&gt;seriously, net neutrality already doesn't apply to cell service.
that's not true.
wired and wireless internet are both under title 2.
&gt;that's why they able to offer deals that don't use your data if you using certain websites.
can they really do this?
they definitely don't have to follow the same rules as isps.
i've heard several radio offers that advertise this as a selling point.
as long as this is allowed then net neutrality doesn't exist for cell providers as far as i'm concerned.
i'm personally fine with limiting my mobile data usage, as long as companies don't take away truly unlimited home and business internet.
i'm on wi-fi at a bar now, and usually am at home.
i pay monthly for 10gb lte, and it's more than enough, if i utilize wi-fi whenever possible.
but if they take away unlimited home internet, i will make sure my elected representatives know that we need full consumer protection when it comes to access to the internet in a free and american way.
the internet is not able to be parceled out like television.
with t-mobile you can stream youtube, spotify, and netflix without cutting into your data limit.
it's called zero rating.
in canada the practice is illegal.
you can offer say a free subscription to spotify premium as a part of your bundle but you can't exclude spotify data from your data cap.
is it different in the us?
yes it must be different in the usa, because that is definitely what t-mobile does yup!
on my t-mobile plan i pay extra so my music streaming isn't counted towards my 10gb cap.
i hate admitting it but it feels like a good deal to me.
&gt; net neutrality already doesn't apply to cell service.
wireless, satellite, and cellular providers absolutely are included in title ii.
right.
the only reason zero-rating stuff exists is because they’re currently doing it illegally.
one of pai’s first actions was to shutdown investigations into these situations.
source?
not that i don't believe you, i just want to have the source handy the next time i have to convince someone nn is important.
from 2016: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-at-t-directv/u-s-fcc-says-it-has-serious-concerns-about-att-direct-tv-mobile-video-service-iduskbn1352kl really looked for a decent source on the dropping of this, but couldn’t find it picked up by anybody i like: https://www.thewrap.com/fcc-drops-investigation-sponsored-zero-rating-data-plans-net-neutrality/ edit: the wsj picked it up.
they’re actually doing some good reporting these days: https://www.wsj.com/articles/fcc-ends-zero-rating-review-1486157682 cool.
thanks for that :) i just remember it.
let me see if i can dig it up.
verizon will be offering a quickprotest(tm) lane with premium complaints, along with a baseprotest(tm) lane that you'll need to wait for.
which protest lane will you be participating in?
well boys the internet was fun while it lasted anyone wanna fund a state wide lan server with a enough porn to last a couple decades?
maybe they should concentrate on the fcc?
verizon stores are nearer.
and have less guards.
and are more visible.
a washington march would also be effective but you’ll get more people asking about it if they see the protests in person.
as long as every single sign talks about net neutrality.
you're all taking about protesting in front of a verizon wireless store, an entity that millions of people have bad feelings about.
if i was unaware of the net neutrality debate and saw a bunch of people protesting in front of a verizon wireless store, my first instinct would be "yeah!
fuck those data overage fees" bear in mind, wireless networks are not beholden to any net neutrality rules.
verizon wireless is looking to compete with those services with their 5g network in 2 years or so, so they would be very happy with nn going away.
as a side note, they are also selling their users data.
i went into one a couple days back and left a few phones on the battle for the net website.
that sure must have confused some people when they found out that none of that applies to verizon wireless, or any cellular service.
or maybe they are still confused, join the protest, and will look like idiots on tv when a reporter points that out.
cellular, wireless, and satellite providers also fall under title ii.
well spectrum doesn't have any cellphones in there office.
may i ask why verizon wireless and not communication stores?
doesn't that just confuse the issue since this effects home internet services and not cell phones?
i think the main connection is that ajit pai worked for verizon.
right.
verizon at large though right?
unless i'm mistaken.
i'm sure that wireless stores are ubiquitous though so that's probably the reason.
just concerned the message gets lost since that's super confusing.
well, then go to an isp office yourself and protest.
i'm not being sarcastic.
i've been talking to people outside of spectrum in kc and telling them about net neutrality for the last three days.
my sign says "call congress!
call the fcc!
save net neutrality."
i hand out slips of paper with the phone numbers for our representatives and the fcc.
my point is that we can waste our last 8 days having conversations online being concerned about if a protest is perfectly designed, or we can get our asses out on the street and talk to people.
most consumers don't know about this issue, but as soon as you explain it to them they want to protect net neutrality.
i already planned on it.
i simply asked a question.
&gt;my point is that we can waste our last 8 days having conversations online being concerned about if a protest is perfectly designed, or we can get our asses out on the street and talk to people.
most consumers don't know about this issue, but as soon as you explain it to them they want to protect net neutrality.
me talking about it now doesn't prevent me from protesting tomorrow.
and furthermore it may cause people to think and be prepared as you are to be extremely clear about what you are protesting.
if people just show up with anti-verizon signs i'm just concerned the message might get lost.
i'll print up a nice big sign that says "net neutrality" on it for those who are confused.
i assume others will too.
exactly my point.
cellular, wireless, and satellite providers also fall under title ii.
&gt; bear in mind, wireless networks are not beholden to any net neutrality rules and yet i have unlimited data and the speeds just keep getting better and better.
it's almost like the free market works, just a couple years ago you were paying the same price for 5gb of 3g.
remember that 480p (or 720p, depending on what tier you buy) streaming video cap verizon has now.
and the throttling after x number if gigs.
and hotspot functionality is capped at 600kbps.
in the early days of data (10 years ago), there weren't caps on anything.
unlimited was unlimited.
like when there was no hd video or hotspots even available?
the technology was crap, it being "unlimited" was basically useless.
not to mention it being insanely expensive.
the market has visibly altered the way phone companies have delivered data plans for the better.
a market not protected by net neutrality.
and let's not pretend verizon (along with comcast, time warner, at&amp;t, ect) isn't the one pulling the strings when it comes to what's going on with the fcc right now.
honestly i'm surprised sprint isn't a massive monopoly.
the name comes from the southern pacific railroad company, they built the lines and yet somehow haven't ever been on the level of rockefeller.
**s**outhern **p**acific **r**ailroad **i**nternal **n**etwork **t**elecommunications.
they were pioneers, but i suppose they weren't greedy enough.
wasn't pretending that at all, sorry if it sounded that way.
just saying that not everyone can take time off and make the trip to the fcc hq.
i was just adding to your comment.
wasn't trying to refute it.
and it will be easy for me to upgrade my data plan while i'm there.
wait.
shit.
i'm not good at protests.
who do you think owns the fcc?
ashit (ajit) pai is in verisons pocket.
they're just protesting the parent company.
i was debating whether or not to take that day off work.
hopefully the protests are still going on after 4:00. can't wait for the riots to break out tomorrow.
thanks a lot, pai, you cunt.
bell is currently lobbying for total censorship of p2p and streaming protocols in canada because everyone is cutting their cords to paid subscription tv and they are bleeding money.
i use p2p to download legal files from www.ocremix.org, but to bell i'm a pirate... wtf?
the internet is under attack by greedy mutha fuckas clear across north america.
holy shit, ocremix is still a thing?
wow.
that really takes me back.
i've still got midi remixes on one of my external drives from them.
anyone who has spent even 20 minutes cumulatively in their entire life studying this issue knows that ajit pai is nothing more than a fucking sock puppet for verizon and even comcast, time warner, and at&amp;t to a lesser extent.
the capitalist state, if left unchecked, is nothing more than the executive committee of the ruling class otherwise known as tyranny nah at least tyranny is honest in its workings why don't i ever see protests on front of google headquarters which lobbied against a "net neutrality"-like bill from becoming a law in california?
call or email congress folks.
fight for the future and electronic frontier foundation are on the fight.
make noise positively.
pai and every politician hates it when they can't make the narrative.
does a-shit-pie have any friends at all?
jeez that guy better stay indoors.
the people have already been ignored and will just be ignored again.
the people in charge know what they're doing and don't care how you feel about it.
you can't dismiss on-site americans as bots or foreign trolls.
we need a law where a person cannot work for a regulatory commision before or after working for the companies they regulate.
lest we forget the stock market crash of 2008. fda and big pharma.
also the epa and this less energy dense ethanol blend bullshit.
or the bp oil spill.
jesus.
then we’d have people with no expertise regulating industries they no nothing about.
that would cause all kinds of problems.
and the current system doesnt?
its like hiring el chapo as the director of the fbi that's fine.
we already have civilians running the military.
just look at any subcommittee in congress.
most members are lawyers and yet subcommittees cover everything.
that law would be struck down as unconstitutional almost immediately.
&gt; we need a law where a person cannot work for a regulatory commision before or after working for the sector they regulate.
the #1 criticism of betsy devos being named secretary of education was that she has absolutely zero professional experience in the educational sector.
and now you want a law that expands that to the entire government.
so when randy babbitt, a 25-year commercial pilot, was named administrator of the faa, that was wrong?
well, i'm sure the irs will have no trouble finding accountants who have never worked in accounting.
the fec would have to be all minors and non-citizens - people who've never been eligible to vote.
and no one who's ever had a job can be in the department of labor, including employees of the department of labor!
i guess it would be all volunteers and unpaid interns.
randy babbit was a pilot, not a lawyer for boeing or united airlines, betsy devos is just a rich bitch in trumps pocket.
i never fleshed out the idea and youre twisting extrapolations to hurt the premise.
people with obvious interest conflicts should not be put in regulatory position.
there was zero refutation to his point there.
did you even read it?
i wasnt trying to refute his point, his point doesnt take away from my point.
there should be a law preventing people with previous and future conflicts of interest from gaining employment in regulatory bodies.
doesn't mean we want party shills or we dont want experienced individuals.
you shouldn't go from being a highly paid lawyer for verizon to chairman of the fcc.
just like if bernie madoff was chairman of the fdic.
or if tony hayward became chairman of the epa.
osama bin laden became director of the cia.
or hillary clinton became the head of the secret service..... there's already a lot of this is in place.
for example we have financial disclosures that are required.
there's insider trading regulations.
the issue lies in enforcement, evasion, and exclusions of the law.
unfortunately, as a rank and file employee of the government there's a lot of regulation in place to check and balance any corruption at my level to keep things copscetic, high ranking officials, they get exclusions, evade applicable regulations, and rarely receive enforcement of applicable laws.
y'know, if pai does get assassinated for doing this ballsy stunt and being greedy, i won't really feel that bad.
he knew about the outrage, and still did it anyways.
it'd be tragedy at its finest.
i imagine that will be the only thing that will get their attention.
if you pass a law that an overwhelming portion (probably close to 100% assuming people are educated on the matter) of the population disagrees with how can you say you're representing your country?
a person in a federal position literally screwing over every tax paying american for personal profit?
i'd say it's treason.
how is this any different than say trump dissolving congress and declaring himself dictator for life?
if you willingly sell out your countrymen as a government official the torches should be lit and the pitchforks brought out.
only when a government fears it's people will true democracy reign.
say what you want about non-violence, it doesn't work.
you can't use the legal system against the people who write the laws and pay the cops' salaries.
well said.
never really made that so clear in my mind.
yeah, i'm afraid that if this passes, we'll have to do some illegal stuff to get it back.
keep in mind, the april poll featured 1/2 a million anti-nn comments by russian ip-sourced spambots that featured both people that did not vote on the poll and dead people's names.
add in the fact that ajit stonewalls his replies, and he'll see that, yes, the cornered rat fights back.
reddit, where being happy about the assassination of someone is upvoted.
upvotes don't exist in real life so yeah this would be the place to go for that type of thing.
i don't understand the benefit of this move.
yeah, verizon sucks, as does at&amp;t, comcast, and pretty much every other telecom, but the individual stores and sales associates have 0 control over the decision.
why not march on the verizon hq?
per [verizonprotests.com](http://verizonprotests.com/), it seems to be about public visibility.
they are not attempting to convince verizon to change its ways.
they want to get noticed by congress and the constituents and influence policy that way.
&gt;why verizon stores?
&gt;the new chairman of the fcc, ajit pai, is a former top lawyer for verizon, and the company has been spending millions on lobbying and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gouge us all for more money.
by protesting at verizon stores, we’re shining light on the corruption and demanding that our lawmakers do something about it.
only congress has the power to stop verizon's puppet fcc, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in some cities we'll be protesting right in front of their offices.
my concern with this, is because it is in front of a verizon wireless store (people forget that part), that the passerbys will think you have a beef with verizon wireless business practices, which gets a lot of flak and is recognized by far more people than net neutrality issues.
if you show up holding signs and handing out materials about net neutrality and their lobbying efforts, i think you can avoid people getting confused.
if it was just about their reprehensible business practices, then the signs would say so.
worst cast scenario is someone see the protest, thinks "huh, verizon must've done something wrong" and then just moves on with their day.
perfect is the enemy of good here.
if you want as many people as possible to participate you can't hold it at a location that's hundreds of miles away for most people.
it's better to have millions protesting across the entire country than to have thousands protesting at a single location.
here in the midwest people are trying to organize to march on their hq *i guess it's an annex but close enough to get noticed.
because there isn't a verizon hq in every city maybe everyone should drop all interwebs and see what happens this isn't going to do shit.
everyone pig pile the nations capital.
&gt; this isn't going to do shit.
why not?
people did this same thing to apple stores in france and suddenly apple agree to pay the taxes in ireland.
they did not want bad publicity short time before iphone x when people understand how much more they are they can change everything lol this will be as effective as occupy...probably the same people too if it passes, is it possible that there will be internet providers who explicitly say they will not block/limit any websites?
then, everyone will switch to them instead of verizon or whoever short answer, no.
slightly longer answer: isps collude with one another because they've done the math and realized that any amount of customers to be gained by encroaching on the turf of a competitor won't outweigh the cost of establishing the infrastructure necessary to do so.
this gentlemen's agreement between isps means that there won't be innovation sprouting up like flowers in the spring soil.
what it means is that the currently existing monopolies can flex their respective muscles even further to squeeze every penny out of the hostages they have the nerve to call customers.
there's not really any additional infrastructure to establish though.
everything would be the same as today.
i'm no expert on the matter, but hasn't at&amp;t cockblocked google fiber in nashville on the basis that google would have to use their existing utility poles?
it will pass, drop the if.
i plan to use a vpn with microsoft or amazon.
it will be annoying paying another five bucks a mouth but with the new antiprivacy laws passed a few months ago it is probably time to do it.
couldn't isps restrict vpn use?
if they can block sites or slow down access, i don't see how they can't block vpns.
good, at least these protestors know who the real enemies of america are.
what ever happened to the people protesting at this pai dickheads house and sending pizzas?
that obviously bothered him quite a bit and maybe that's the route everyone has to take.
if he wants to sell out all of his fellow citizens he should be out-casted and his family and children should know how much of a piece of shit he is.
i would love to see this asshole in his final days full of regret and sorrow when the money doesn't matter anymore and everyone he cares about sees him for the corrupt, failure of a human being he really is.
a mob harassing sales associates in the name of political activism... what could go wrong?
and customers too probably.
perfect, harass the low level employees who have nothing to do with it.
whose idea a was it to protest on a weekday afternoon when most people are at work?
i'd imagine this will result in a much, much lower turnout.
where are you getting "afternoon" from?
most of the protests i see are scheduled for early evening, which is when most people get off work.
https://events.battleforthenet.com/#eventtype=protestrally starting from the top: 1 pm 10 am 11 am 4 pm 9 am 12 pm 3 pm 3 pm 5 pm 12 pm 12 am (lol) 9 am 4 pm 10 am and on and on.
if typical business hours are 8-5, i would say at least 90% of them are taking place during those hours.
i was looking at the ones posted on verizonprotest.com, which shows several in illinois between 5-7pm, so mileage may vary.
it's not like protesters would go *inside* the stores.
[here](https://events.battleforthenet.com/#eventtype=protestrally) you can see that nearly all protests take place between 9-5, when a lot of people will be working.
most of them are in the afternoon, including the protests local to me.
this is a huge blunder in my opinion.
pretty much anyone working a 9-5 job will be absent, so the crowd size won't really be an accurate representation of the opposition.
the cynical side of me wonders if this was intentional.
have you seen the scheduled of protests?
&gt; whose idea a was it to protest on a weekday afternoon when most people are at work?
the people who don't have a job to worry about.
&gt;&gt; whose idea a was it to protest on a weekday afternoon when most people are at work?
&gt; &gt;the people who don't have a job to worry about.
so people who don't matter, got it.
yeah, i’m sure this will do a lot.
too bad this won't amount to anything but annoy some employees who have no say in the matter.
like protests will do shit.
unless a vast majority of american's cancel their internet and cellphone plans and hurt the bottom line of not just verizon but every isp (because don't forget, they all benefit) it means nothing.
it's not going to happen, i bet not even 5% of people would go a month before re-upping their subscription.
congress and the executives at verizon are laughing in their villas sipping the finest of beverages.
all bought with money they stole.
well that surely will make a difference!
/s yelling at commission based retail employees is totally going to fix net neutrality!!
anything that google, reddit, comcast, facebook etc.
and all of the other monopolizers are in favor of, im skeptical of choosing just one store chain does jack otherwise it's like just harassing store clerks of a just one company.
so honestly, i don't fully approve.
we should instead attack every isp and mobile provider that has historically had a hostile stance toward net neutrality, not just verizon.
isn’t there a gofundme to raise money for an assassin to kill pai?
i'm sure screaming at a bunch of people just working their retail job will help.
maybe protest at verizon's corporate offices or at mr. pai's house and work?
if you really want to get verizon's attention, switch carriers en masse.
sure, other telecom companies aren't innocent so this alone is not going to save net neutrality, but if this is about protesting one specific company, that would be the best way.
paying $200+ cancellation fee to make a point...lol they’ll just name the next bill “the lovers of the united states support this bill”.
rednecks will lose their mind if they haven’t already over trump endorsing it.
ok, so at the very it least it looks like in the short term we're gonna get fucked for a while.
for example, i (like many other people) have contacted my reps and senators about the issue stating that repealing nn only benefits big telecom companies and basically fucks everyone else.
so with doing my duty as a us citizen out of the way, what can i do to bypass all this bullshit?
what do i look for?
i already utilize a vpn service (which i might change for a non us based company, or create my own).
is there anything else that i, and everyone else, can use to free ourselves from this catastrophic shit storm?
well.. you know it's in the constitution that we can abolish the government if it does something that isn't democratic or just unfair, like repealing net neutrality when everyone wants it to stay.
what i mean is that some people's entire lives revolve around the internet, like their work, relationships and their source of entertainment.
this would hit those people really hard.
i think it would be cool if ajit pai was afraid for his safety.
ajit pai is a piece of shit.
ajit pai needs to die honestly.
every time verizon is mentioned my wifes commission check gets a little bit bigger.
remember the womens march?
asside from solidarity, which is important, what did that accomplish?
not tryimg to be pessemistic.
just realistic.
is it pessemistic to think theyre virtually the same?
or is that just brutal honesty?
of all the days i pick to transfer from verizon to t-mobile due to high prices i had to pick today.
i guess overall it's a good thing since i can use net neutrality as an excuse for leaving them and hope they don't try to sell me on other plans or some temporary discount bullshit.
yea t-mobile might be just as bad but when you need reliable service for work stuff you gotta just go with the lesser evil i guess.
when are we the people going to stand up and march on the fcc headquarters and force the issue.
there are over 400 million of us.
how have we been made so weak and complacent we'll give you internet on tuesday, for your liberties today.
why verizon?
why not outside the fcc?
they're not going to protest online?
remember when major sites went dark over pipa and sopa?
what happened between then and now?
the most any site is doing is only discussing nn or changed their logo to a slowed down version.
is the assault alleged, or is he the alleged perpetrator of the assault?
those are very different things.
sounds like the assault is not "alleged".
it clearly happened.
he is the *alleged attacker*.
really poor editing on the cbc's part, says i. it's an alleged attack until proven in a court of law, so the title is correct.
it's also true that he is the alleged attacker, but the two are not mutually exclusive, so the title is still correct since it makes no reference to "alleged attacker" at all.
instead, it accurately identifies that the man has been charged for an alleged assault.
hmmm... this may be a legal vs. common language issue.
with 25 witnesses, there's no question that the event happened.
whether a court defines it as "assault" and whether the suspect is legally responsible, are issues for the court.
does this square our perspectives?
&gt;"he tried to grab my head and force it onto his crotch," she said.
"he tried to grab me by my headscarf."
&gt;fadel said she attempted to move out of the way and put her hands up to defend herself.
she couldn't reach the emergency help button and none of the passengers helped, she said.
and this, ladies and gentlemen, is the psychology of distributed responsibility of crowds.
but i can't help but imagine that an additional bias against muslims was at play.
no one intervened until he hit her in the face.
and even so, only one guy did so.
those people were disgusting to watch all this unfold without even lifting a finger or raising their voice.
agreed this is disgusting.
more people should have stood up for the poor girl.
was happy to read this afterwards.
http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/why-a-lone-good-samaritan-stepped-up-in-a-vancouver-attack-on-muslim-teen/ edit: should of to should have.
from the macleans article: &gt;(noor) almost every other day i get verbally assaulted and it hurts every single time—at my workplace, at my school, in everyday life.
...wtf is wrong with people??
some don't realize we are all human beings.
it's disgusting but unfortunately it is the world we live in.
*should have if it's so dangerous for muslims, maybe they should find refuge in a safer country.
i hear saudi arabia is pretty muslim-friendly, she should move there.
if you're sunni.
shia should probably look towards iraq or iran.
perhaps people shouldn't attack people
good to see florida man finally got a job.
hope this turns his life around before what, the the mid 20 meth years strike?
silly you.
meth begins as a florida sperm.
did he also reveal how he hacked?
if so wouldn't that just be a really good bug bounty pay out?
if i am understanding correctly, the current ceo believes the previous ceo may have paid hackers to "destroy" the data that was stolen through a breach, and did it through a bounty bug payment to cover it up and make it look like they provided a legitimate service, when that would have actually been blackmail.
the ceo is saying it was an incident that should have been reported to regulators, which makes it sound like it could be more than just a bug bounty.
i'm not saying if it happened one way or the other, i just believe that is what the current ceo is getting at.
it is also important to note that it is honestly in the current ceo's best interest to have remained quiet about the incident if regulators did not pick up on it.
episode 111 of reply all podcast just explained the ransom turned bug bounty situation.
https://play.google.com/music/m/dudlcl7v6mupawtbawpv3xj6veu?t=111_return_of_the_russian_passenger_-_reply_all florida man, florida man, blowing the whistle while extorting man.
look out!
here comes the florida man.
florida man, florida man, hit on the head with a frying pan, lives his life in a garbage can, florida man.
florida man, florida man, florida man hates universal healthcare man, prefers to be financially raped by private healthcare man, florida man, florida man... they have a fight, florida man wins [and eats triangle man's face], florida man florida man strikes again!
it's like uber is run by dr. evil's smart by fuckup son scott.
great to see florida man finally having some success!!
[](/starlightwat)florida man is like bizarro barbie with all the different jobs you can find him in, only it's usually sad, illegal and awful.
apparently not enough.
looks like he didn't do what he was paid to!
i am actually glad this was a floridaman.
the identity of this hacker needs to be release and he needs to be sued under the florida cadra act.
specifically: &gt; 668.803 prohibited acts.—a person who knowingly and with intent to cause harm or loss: &gt;(1) obtains information from a protected computer without authorization and, as a result, causes harm or loss; &gt;(2) causes the transmission of a program, code, or command to a protected computer without authorization and, as a result of the transmission, causes harm or loss; or &gt;(3) traffics in any technological access barrier through which access to a protected computer may be obtained without authorization, is liable to the extent provided in s. 668.804 in a civil action to the owner, operator, or lessee of the protected computer, or the owner of information stored in the protected computer who uses the information in connection with the operation of a business.
his hacker would be liable not only to uber under section 1/2 but also to individual record holders (all 57 million of them) under section 3. just for completeness of this comment here is what the civil remedies are: &gt; 668.804 remedies.— &gt;(1) a person who brings a civil action for a violation under s. 668.803 may: &gt;(a) recover actual damages, including the person’s lost profits and economic damages.
&gt;(b) recover the violator’s profits that are not included in the computation of actual damages under paragraph (a).
&gt;(c) obtain injunctive or other equitable relief from the court to prevent a future violation of s. 668.803.
&gt;(d) recover the misappropriated information, program, or code, and all copies thereof, that are subject to the violation.
&gt;(2) a court shall award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party in any action arising under this part.
&gt;(3) the remedies available for a violation of s. 668.803 are in addition to remedies otherwise available for the same conduct under federal or state law.
&gt;(4) a final judgment or decree in favor of the state in any criminal proceeding under chapter 815 shall estop the defendant in any subsequent action brought pursuant to s. 668.803 as to all matters as to which the judgment or decree would be an estoppel as if the plaintiff had been a party in the previous criminal action.
&gt;(5) a civil action filed under s. 668.803 must be commenced within 3 years after the violation occurred or within 3 years after the violation was discovered or should have been discovered with due diligence.
as an additional matter, the “hacker” can face criminal charges under section 815.06 florida statutes, likely as a second degree felony.
someone needs to get repeatedly kicked in the tits over this.
sounds like it was a big bounty and not paying him for silence probably a little of both, thats a ton of cash for a bug bounty.
nothing like cracking open a cold one after a long day of work.
probably one the darkest jokes i’ve ever laughed at.
good one lol that one isn't that dark there are far darker jokes but was it with the boys tho?
a good stiff one deserves another without the internet, i couldn't hear about stuff like this while i take shits at work.
what a glorious invention ahh, willirico on the front page.
refreshing.
just another day in paradise/heroin town usa.
&gt; aaron stated he knew the victim hated having sex with him so he figured that the victim might wake up if he had sex with her.
you don’t say... edit: oh, he has a go fund me for her funeral/drug money.
lovely.
no money raised yet though.
i grew up in tolland.
haven't heard the term willirico in years.
got a little bit of a chuckle out of that.
thanks.
i grew up in good ole willarico glad to see it hasn’t changed.
also from willimantic, heyo i live there now, its definitely an interesting place.
grew up there in the early 90s and it was full of heroin then i can only imagine what it’s like now we’re the heroin hipsters.
we had it before it was cool/a result of overprescribing.
at least willibrew is good &gt;ahh, willirico on the front page.
refreshing.
i know someone's a local when they use the term "willirico" he coulda just married my ex-wife she hated having sex with him, so he had sex with her in an attempt to revive her from an overdose?
junkie-logic... sounds like rape, 1st degree to me that and man slaughter.
except the autopsy showed she was already dead - had no blood flow - when he has sex with her.
i’m guessing hashtag metoo would be inappropriate.
depends, is zombie a protected group?
only in california and parts of new york especially since it can be read (#pound)metoo i live in willimantic, this is crazy!
its pretty obvious there is a drug problem.
there are plenty of junkies just walking around high as a kite.
on a plus side, i haven't seen as much prostitution lately.
man am i glad i dont like heroine.
or dead people.
too much reddit today.
that judge has a sense of humor: "[he] was spared placement on the state’s sex offender registry after the judge found “registration is not required for public safety based upon the facts in this case.”' i dont know how to feel about that.
don’t be so rigid i agree.
this creep avoids the sex registry but 2 teens who sext each other are branded for life.
silly nonsense maybe we should ensure that they also avoid it rather than expanding a shitty system?
he didn't have sex with a dead woman.
he had sex with a woman who laid dying.
if anything his actions killed her.
he currently didn't do anything to save her.
just a year and not being registered as a sex offender.
justice in this country seems to be a spin of the wheel.
this guy should be charged with man slaughter and registered.
she was dead.
read the article.
how do you think i know she was still breathing, you should read the article and then read it again.
your comprehension seems low.
“aaron stated he listened to see if the victim was breathing and he heard gurgling.
aaron stated he knew the victim hated having sex with him so he figured that the victim might wake up if he had sex with her.” because later on in the article: &gt;"as for the gurgling graser said he heard, that could have been decomposition gases escaping the woman’s body, an investigator from the medical examiner’s office told police."
their reasoning is stupid, "no bruising" so she must have been dead.
most sex doesn't result in bruising.
in any case, dead or alive he should be registered.
he tied her to the bed for pete sakes.
there was no bruising where she was tied up meaning her blood was not flowing there would only be bruising if she was fighting.
it's stupid logic.
determining time of death is not such a finite thing to tell.
whatever the case the guy still thought he was bounding and raping an unconscious woman.
i am sorry but i am trusting the doctors opinion that there would be blood under the skin.
fighting or not if you tie someone up tightly there is bruising at the site.
now this isn't a defense of what he did but i think they know what they are talking about.
maybe you can make the argument that the fentanyl slowed her heart too much for the blood to pool.
[deleted] there is no way you can tie someone tight and not leave a mark edit: and paramedics don't do autopsies shoulda wrote finish the article.
my bad.
where were all these women when i was still working in the morgue?
okay, but was she hot?
dead cold, actually.
'she's as cold as ice'..... not to say that what he did isn't disgusting, but as a woman who has to regularly engage in "abortion is (not) a murder" debate, i have a problem with calling a mindless lump of cells a "victim" of "sexual assault".
especially considering that it would've been perfectly legal for him to put up her taxidermied naked body on display in a museum.
she wasn't dead when he started raping her.
“aaron stated he listened to see if the victim was breathing and he heard gurgling."
so, then.
a rapist and a murderer... according to the me, she was already dead, and the gurgling was likely just gasses escaping the body.
but as for intent, he didn't have the intent to sleep with a dead woman.
hell, he was trying to save her....he rapes to save!
he tied her to the bed dave.
probably not the first time he's tied her to the bed and raped her.
would you like to see your recently deceased family member fucked?
probably not.
of course i wouldn't.
i also wouldn't want to see my recently deceased family member's naked taxidermied body put on display in a museum.
and my family will never allow my organs to be donated after my death.
i just find it interesting that a dead human body is legally a person and not a person, depending on circumstances.
your family should allow your organs to be donated unless they wouldn't ever accept a donated organ themselves they should.
but they won't.
if you're in the usa it's not up to them, it's your choice legally i'm not.
if they have no family, a document alone is binding, but if the healthcare proxy (which if not listed defaults to various family members in a specific order in ny) does not want to donate the organs, they will not harvest them.
living people trump documents as a rule.
abortion is a bit different, plus you don't have sex with it after.
its quite a bnit different.
i dare you to explain that difference to a pro-lifer.
...unless you are a pro-lifer and you think fetuses deserve more rights than corpses.
i've met some who do.
nah, i have enough to deal with than someone like that.
them, anti vaccination people and flat earth people are so stuck in their little bubbles they can't see anyone elses view point.
especially not a woman's.
well, this woman thinks unthinking, unfeeling lumps of cells aren't people, even if at some other point in time they might have been/will be people.
eh, maybe.
fucking either a fetus or dead body is still fucked up.
i never said it wasn't.
interesting point.
the same logic should apply here you can only do that with permission from the family though.
abuse of a corpse is a crime because it victimizes the family.
yeah i know that.
that's why i said what he did was disgusting.
i'm reminded of alice cooper's seminal (heh) rock hit from the early 1970s, *cold ethyl.
* why no pictures of the dead woman?
was she at least hot?
doesn't matter.
he's probably one of those guys who'll go after anything with a hole and a heartbeat.
except in this case, his standards weren't quite that high.
probably room temperature.
well, she was a junkie from willimantic who was dating that guy...you do the math.
she got expired?
like some kind of food storage, a chillin feelin got me there
isn't it already going to be legal january 1st in the whole state?
the law still allows individual cities to choose whether they want to allow sales within their borders, so this is la choosing how they will go about allowing sales la was always going to allow it...this article (sentence) lol i'd like to officially propose the term for the pot equivalent of "dry" (as in, a "dry county" being one where you can't buy alcohol) to be "uptight."
is sd good?
california... knows how to party.
in the city... city of la.
jesus this is all so fucked.
yeah, screw letting individual communities determine how they want to be governed!
except it’s illegal federally, legal in some states, not legal to carry to another state, not legal to sell in some places in the state, legal to grow plants for personal use in some states and not others, it’s largely cash only because of the problems with legality, etc... yeah, as much as i support individual state and community action, there needs to be common-sense federal action on rescheduling.
which won't happen until an fda trial which takes 5-7 years, thanks to the dea for that bullshit.
it's why mdma will be rescheduled before cannabis.
it is being researched to great effect iirc but one leads to the other, so what's the problem?
but people can still grow their own plants for individual use.
nothing really changes, it's just all out in the open now.
the people that consumed now have a safe place in which to buy and the citizens reap the social and tax revenue benefits.
it's been legal since the day after the vote (november 8th 2016).
they left out the word sales, which start january 1st 2018. local municipalities can allow, regulate or ban sales.
so it wasn't a given that it would be legal to sell in la on january 1st.
&gt; so it wasn't a given that it would be legal to sell in la on january 1st.
la is currently the largest cannabis market in the world.
there is no way they were going to ban weed, so, yes, it was a "given" that it would be legal in la.
source- have sold many thousands of pounds of weed to dispensaries in la...oh, sorry, i meant "donated".
ca here.
weed, would be "legal" statewide, but cities and counties can choose not to sell it within their borders if they wish.
many counties are choosing to cash in on the tax $$$$.
la is simply the largest city so far in the state to give a thumbs up.
i don't smoke so it does not affect me anyways, but i like examining the laws.
lets be honest though, the entire la area (nix parts of the oc) and the entire bay area will legalize.
kern county just a couple hours north of la has voted to ban sales along with most of the cities in the county.
the rest just haven't voted yet.
keep in mind this is the council's voting and not the public.
of course kern county wouldnt legalize - they earn all the revenue they need by handing out $500 speeding tickets on i5!
but really, tha county is veryg red, not surprising at all.
and its not considered a part of the la metro or greater laarea.
correct.
it is very unfortunate considering that we need the tax revenue pretty damn bad.
is there a list somewhere that i can check which counties/cites and banning selling?
kern county is a shithole though.
i think the only oc city to allow it so far has been santa ana.
anaheim doesn't allow but doesn't enforce either.
they know where the shops are and leave them alone so far ... this is about recreational sales not medical sales.
they won't be allowing the recreational sale in anaheim... the medical shops can keep doing what they've been doing.
anaheim does not allow marijuana shops of any variety in their town.
that being said, there are over 100 at any given time.
is there a list somewhere?
we'll see how long legal sales last though, we've decided we needed a 45% tax on sales.
and a ban of any edible over 100 mg total package size, with a 10 mg max dose.
its like they don't even care what we need.
oregon checking in.
we have a high tax as well but legality has led to retail prices low enough that it’s not unreasonable.
plus, one of the bigselling points pro-legalization folks have used is tax revenue.
it irks me to hear of the same people complaining about paying the tax now that they got what they asked for.
oc is fiscally conservative, but not necessarily "morally" or socially so.
if the white middle class people there would bother to vote or even have an informed opinion, i think it would easily pass.
&gt; la is simply the largest city so far in the state the geographer in me has to comment: it will remain that way as it's the largest city in the state, period.
it was made legal *last* january 1st to have up to an ounce on you for personal use, in your own home.
there has yet to be any licenses issued for *sales* though, so basically, you could grow it yourself and smoke up all you want, but couldn't (legally) purchase it anywhere.
legally.
not true, you can legally purchase at most shops if you are over 21 right now.
18 with a medical rec.
some shops have chosen to wait until jan 1st to open up to rec sales, but most in my area are open for it.
uh, no, that's not legal.
you can probably purchase, but not legally.
that wouldn't surprise me.
but they don't have a license to sell for recreation purposes.
not many shops have licenses.
anaheim technically bans all pot shops, but there are over 100 active shops that have signs and fully advertise what they are.
full compliance shops are rare and there doesn't seem to be much enforcement at the moment.
that is supposed to change in jan but i really don't see that happening.
&gt; full compliance shops are rare and there doesn't seem to be much enforcement at the moment.
i get it.
i'm saying that's still *not legal*.
just because it's not enforced doesn't make it legal.
enjoy it while you can, because when they do start issuing licenses, they will crack down on those shops.
just like you can't open a public bar in your garage by just buying liquor and offering it for sale.
right, cuz medical licensing is so strictly enforced and monitored.
i'm not worried i never said you ought to be worried, i was saying you were wrong in calling those legal dispensaries.
they are not.
&gt;not many shops have licenses.
no one has a license to sell now.
the licenses don't take effect until jan 1st... even the ones already issued to people getting ready to sell recreationally.
if they're doing it its illegal.
&gt;some shops have chosen to wait until jan 1st to open up to rec sales, but most in my area are open for it.
then they're doing it illegally... the licenses that are being issued don't take effect until jan1st.
everyone buying now should still have a rec.
&gt;there has yet to be any licenses issued for sales though, that's actually not true.
they started issueing them i think.
they don't go into effect on the 1st though.
6am is when they can open.
these are also temporary 90-120 licenses if i recall so they can be up and running day 1 if their city allows it.
the thing holding back the permits was whether the city would allow it and since la just passed their rules shops here can probably get their permits now.
if its accepted in your city there will be shops who have temporary recreational licenses on january 1st ready for you to buy if you're 21+.
maybe they had some local regulations in place?
that, and there were already a few shops in la that would sell it to anyone.
all these places..... are so far away.
why cant a place like..... near tampa have this..... because of old people so you’re telling me it’s going to be even more smokey here in a few weeks?
blaze it the bushs in thehills around you know whats up that was the shortest article i've ever seen.
i love that i didn't have to scan through 5 paragraphs before i actually found out what the news was.
what's going to be interesting here is second wave - what are these shops going to look like, and what additional cpg items, are they going to be retailing?
how's the amsterdam pot cafe model going to line up to what american's want?
there's so much money to be made here, and someone's gotta set the tone for what a legal, approachable weed spot should look like in the us.
i mean - teppanyaki?
grab-n-go.
orrich french saucy dishes full of dank at fancy spots?
i'm thinking hookah lounge, just without that much body hair and iran's hot 100 hits.
i want to open a movie theater with the comfiest lazyboy chairs, lots of snacks, and a great ventilation system that you can smoke in.
that's my dream for legalization no way are they going to allow smoking indoors of public businesses.
haha you're gonna have to hire people to waoe up your customers when the movie ends well there are already plenty of examples in the us with co, wa and or.
assuming la doesn't burn to the ground... id just like to see la focus on having less people in it not gonna happen god i hate this attitude.
"la was full the moment i got here/ was born here.
no one else should come here now."
what makes you being here ok and not someone else?
people have been flocking to la for a long long time and that's not going to change any time soon.
but, hey, you're free to leave, that wouldmake the city have less people in it.
i guess he doesn't understand the concept of a city.
idk, i also live 2500 miles from there soooooo calm down?
weed lowers fertility, and smoking it is carcinogenic, so there’s your silver lining i guess fertility related problems reverse when the subject stops smoking for a period longer than 20 days and its related to the testosterone decrease.
tobacco is 10fold as carcinogenic (due to the amount per day that tobacco smokers smoke compared to marijuana smokers) and is legal.
weed smokers can vape thc if concerned about their health.
thc also reduces the binding of carcinogenic alive cells that bind, making some types of cancer less frecuent amongst users, as a study from the unicersity of barcelona reveals.
also, taxes man, weed raises money for the people if legalized, if not, it does for the dealers.
that towns already blazing.
hey, i'm from argentina and i'll be going to la in january, what should i expect regarding pot vendors?
weed has been effectively decriminalized for years in california.
i've felt safe from the cops walking down the street with a joint in hand for a long time.
black market dealers can still get in trouble if they're stupid, and now they'll get in trouble for tax evasion if they continue.
but you can believe that they will pay those taxes.
the more taxes they pay, the more money they're making.
as it is now, until january you can't go into a dispensary without a medical prescription.
it is very easy to get a medical prescription.
that is the only obstacle to getting high right now and that is going away.
a lot of people still go to their local dealer because it's just easier sometimes.
thanks for the insight, my man.
yeah, i've been there in september, and i could only buy weed via friends that had that medical prescription.
i really want to go by myself to the dispensary this time.
the dispensaries are usually really nice.
people are friendly and willing to help.
jars of all the dankest weed around.
each labeled with thc content and strain.
it’s like going in a candy store and picking your flavors.
usually you’ll find they are pretty clean, and smell like mounds of lush kush.
honestly just walk around and ask someone.
last time i was in cali literally just went to the beach and asked this guy painting aliens if he had a hookup.
but on january first, you can go into a store and buy it?
you already can, but yes more stores on jan 1 you can buy recreational weed at the moment?
i was just out there and the google told me they were all medical until january.
you can get a medical card for a stubbed toe basically.
it is more of a formality than anything else.
but you need to live in ca to get one.
yup, just purchased last night.
you cannot buy weed without a medical license until january 1st, and even then it's on a city-by-city basis.
every city needs to form their own rules about where the dispensaries can be located and how they're going to go about collecting taxes.
remember, it is still illegal under federal law and the banks won't work with the dispensaries.
taxes must be paid in cash, probably with armored cars.
so in la, in january first, will recreational be accessible?
it already is accessible as recreational use.
just call the store you plan on visiting and ask if they take only medical card users or if they also allow 21+ recreational users.
oh shit you can just call!?!
i thought they were just being cool no medical card here and i've bought cannabis from multiple stores already in the oc and la area.
some stores already allows the sale of cannabis if you're 21+ the more you spend the more you save!
its pretty great, if you've never gone to a store before.
10-30+ strains to choose from and hundreds of concentrates, edibles, etc.
other things: taking weed across state borders is illegal.
even though weed is legal in nevada and oregon, carrying it across statd borders is still a crime.
granted, the chances of being caught are tiny (would require a us federal policeman to stop you), which is pretty unheard of unless its a dea sting or something (you never know with our current attorney general).
public smoking is still looked down on in many areas (and is technically illegal) and i wouldnt advise it unless you know the area.
also, smoking weed is way more tolerated and more mainstream in sf/oakland than in socal; if you get the chance to venture up that way.
but the weed is just as good in both :) enjoy your trip to la!
great question.
i'm going in february to orange/anaheim/redondo.
would these legal sales only be for california residents?
when i travelled to colorado from out of state, i was capable of walking into a dispensary with proper age verification.
i'm fairly certain that marijuana tourism will be a thing for california as well.
no i think you just need age verification.
and don't travel with it across the state borders.
yep, this is a big thing for non-americans to know.
travel over a state border and you can get nailed with drug charges, technically even going to another legal state too if they both share a land border.
and don't go through a border patrol checkpoint.
they'll write you a ticket.
for anyone 21+ no, but not sure if orange county has made laws about permitting etc yet.
they are typically more conservative than los angeles so you might have to drive up to la to actually purchase.
but you can have it on you wherever dont spread misinformation.
oc and sd have thriving pot communities.
anaheim alone had over 143 shops at one point.
no one is spreading misinformation.
it took them much longer to figure out medical marijuana.
it will probably take them longer than la to figure out recreational.
which it already has since la now has laws and processes in place.. i know it might not seem that way if you haven't been around since the beginning of medical marijuana, but it is i have been actually.
i remember having to drive hours to find a doc.
now i get it done via fax.
oc and sd have medical and recreational laws in place.
we're not la's backward cousin probably that they will be on fire.
eh since it's so soon your options will be limited, but there are well funded businesses that will be up and running early january i'm sure.
it's been pretty much legal for so long here that anyone who smokes just has a rec.
since this vote just happened it will take a while for everything to be up and running full speed, but there will be people with lots of money and experience ready to pounce.
i'd expect at least 1-2 recreational places per part of la to be open early january though i was under the impression that it was already legal to buy pot recreationally.
i travelled out to la 2 weeks ago and bought edibles from a dispensary in san bernardino county.
everything looked legit, they just had me fill out some paperwork in the lobby.
after i finished they let me into another part of the building where i was free to buy weed and edibles.
that paperwork probably said you were a legal medical patient under penalty of perjury.
if anyone did sign that, it would be wise of them to not leave behind any fingerprints they need to sell it now.
those wild fires blazing will allow users to save on lighters.
literally turn the whole town into a hot box’.
'hold my mint julep!"
\-\- jeff sessions, probably but, good people don't smoke marijuana!
this article was one sentence.
what a bunch of bullshit.
pot is truly a wonder drug with no negative effects.
don't they have enough smoke in the air already?
:-( hey, that's pretty good.
leave denver and go there, everyone who hasn't lived here for the past ten years.
where do you think all these californians come from in the first place?
they come from all the other states.
that's why we have so many people.
stop complaining about your wonderful state being crowded.
nobody cares when californians do it and we've had the most practice at it.
yep, as a nat.
born californian i laugh when people bitch about us "invading" other states, when a good portion of people living here were not even born here.
they exhaust the resources until everywhere is a mirror of la county, similar to locusts, then expand to the next livable area.
haha exactly.
i rented a room in la from a guy from boston when first out of college.
he thought it was weird that all of my friends and me were from california.
he didn’t know anyone who wasn’t from out of state!
or you can go fuck yourself because i've lived my entire adult life here.
you are what makes the state shitty, not transplants.
colorado is a freaking state of transplants going back to its beginnings.
there's no old money here or some shit like that.
just cause you moved here in 2000 or 1990 or 1920 doesn't mean you are more a coloradan than someone that moved here last week.
get over yourself (and please, if you have one of those native stickers, kick yourself in the ass for me because you look like an idiot).
fuck off, triggered fuck.
i'm done giving a shit about whether or not traffic is getting worse and if rent is going up.
so fucking annoying.
wahhh my state doesn't have legal weed so i'll just move to colorado wahhh.
get over myself?
sorry bud, but i already consider myself to be trhe lowest piece of scum to ever exist on the face of this planet.
why did you even decide to pay ant attention to what i wrote?
you should have obviously been able to tell that its nothing more than a senseless shitpost.
and i'm not what makes colorado shitty, i'm just some guy on the internet.
y'all are the ones clogging the streets and driving up rent.
you lived here your entire adult life yeah?
then depending on how old you are, i have no quarrel with you.
but fuck it.
no more shits from this guy.
nope.
ajit pai can rip net neutrality away from everyone i don't care.
i've even seen arguments from citizens supporting the repealing of net neutrality so you know what i think?
i will always be wrong.
i will only ever be a worthless piece of trash, undeserving of the air he breathes.
good, if you stopped giving a shit, then shut the fuck up and stop complaining.
also, by the fact that you started ranting about completely unrelated topics, i'm going to assume (or hope) you're drunk.
you okay?
it's only 1:30... not drunk, just got off work.
i'm never ok, but it doesn't matter.
have a good one.
so...this time the smog will give you a contact high?
nations largest city to become nations largest city?
la isn't the largest city you are correct!
the largest city in the us is sitka, alaska.
los angeles is #12. correct.
sometimes people say jacksonville, fl, but that's the largest in the lower 48. isn't los angeles the nation's largest city as it is?
why not say, the nation's largest city with a hotdog stand in it?
the largest city where a hooker can go bowling?
the largest city that has a bodega in it?
please don’t breed.
have you never heard of new york city?
i grew up there... they held la over our heads every day... more spread out, hence "largest"... didn't matter we had more people, they were the largest city.
la is full of stoned and homeless - its like the walking dead i can't wait for all of our bums to leave and go to la where they belong... 2018 will be a great year.
they're not legalizing meth.
meth is already legal.
with a prescription.
but i enjoyed your snarky comment non the less.
😉 when are you setting off for la?
i always love how people look down on california as a bunch of lazy pot smoking hippies.
meanwhile large industries that have powered wealth across the country was born and built up here.
the internet wouldn't exist without what was done by californians lazy jobless stoners and rich coastal elites all at once...whichever one is convenient in the argument at hand!
/s we have our fair share of bums in british columbia, but a lot of respectable citizens are using pot for medicinal purposes here.
here's olivia newton john talking about the subject.
she is using it to combat nausea and pain due to her cancer battle: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xei5drnkde by the way i don't use weed at all.
never have.
i just know productive people who do.
pot smoker here.
oil even, daily.
actual, productive, tax paying mortgage paying career having child raising member of society.
checking in.
i know a doctor who is a regular user, but not when he's on call.
i know a lot of pot heads too though.
doctors, lawyers, judges.
i've met plenty of all of them.
then why the fuck are we still pretending americans hate it?
fuck if i know dude, my perspective is pretty biased though: i live in central/northern ca.
i'm in northern ca too, there is more weed than there are vegetable gardens pew study from last year.
[link](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/12/support-for-marijuana-legalization-continues-to-rise/) because unfortunately many do.
reddit is in no way whatsoever representative of america and even less representative of who actually votes.
i can't wait until you become a bum.. 2019 will be a great year.
&gt;:] those tax cuts oh boy get ready son.
they're already there?
not all of them.
not yet
let me guess, they looked out their windows and saw all the jets playing wargames, then looked at their radars and saw nothing, so lil’ kim wet his panties and wants to talk things over?
normally this would be good in calming them the fuck down, but with trump i can't help but wonder if it would be less offensive to just bomb them as opposed to whatever trump is going to say.
you're worried about offending kim jong un?
na i'm just saying, if you want the path to peace or negotiations with any nation, its probably less offensive to just bomb them then to let trump let off a trumpism.
unless of course you want to fray relations further.
i think that relations are so bad that they can't get any worse.
the only way out that i can imagine is that kim gets overthrown in a military coup.
wouldn't tillerson or some other diplomat be the one to do the negotiations for the most part?
should we keep appeasing them?
anyone with an educated answer please respond.
i dint understand how letting them become more and more advanced is a good idea.
theres no good solution, its been an awkward uncomfortable stalemate for ages.
south korea does not want to reintergrate nk because its a shithole and would tank their economy, china does not want sk/us to rule the land on their border.
the nk regime is vicious and fucking terrible, but it can't be easily removed.
they are really dug in and have a ton of firepower ready to unload on sk.
which obviously sk does not want to happen.
and chinese support.
at least in theory.
nk developing nukes makes removing them as a threat through military harder, and i think the only sad solution is to keep doing what we've always been doing, supplying them with food in exchange for nuclear disarmament.
we finally have a chance to nuke nk and wipe fat fuck's family dynasty off the map.
steve bannon approves of nuking nk now.
waste no more time.
you are fucking crazy -- seek help lol!
you wouldn't recognize a total troll comment if it hit you in the pussy.
is this fake news...or not?
trump fans, a little help?
you guys said this number was a lie under obama, is it still a lie?
lol not a trumpster, but independent.
consumer confidence is at its highest point in 17 years.
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-31/u-s-consumer-confidence-index-rises-to-highest-level-since-2000 the "real news" number is the u6 figure, which is total unemployed.
that number is dropping as well.
https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm my opinion.
through obama's presidency, his administration gets the credit for clawing us out of the worst recession in history.
any trump effect now is primarily due to reactionary market forces maintaining momentum of an inevitable cyclical upswing, even if trump can exit a two-term presidency without crashing the economy, he'll still get blamed for the next recession much like bush is often blamed for the 2008 recession which obama inherited.
the right blames obama for 2008, the left blames bush, in reality it was cyclical market forces exacerbated by sub-prime mortgage markets due to easy money and unconventional lending practices.
trump is making all of the right moves to maintain an economic upswing, however the fed is also going to do its own thing regardless and raise rates to buffer for the next downturn despite very low inflation, so it'll be interesting to see how this works out.
given the reactionary nature of the dow right now, it is the best indicator of trumps economic success, as you'll notice that markets plunge on any negative political news coming out of the white house, while it skyrockets on "positive" news like the tax bill.
the tax bill in my opinion will not raise incomes across the board, but it will stimulate the economy by driving investment, which in turn usually turns into more jobs.
there are two types of investors, ones that water at the mouth for easy returns and dividends, and ones that would rather see a company reinvest profits to grow the stock price sustainably.
there are more of the good kind when all economic factors are up, because there is less fear of having to cut out before a major crash.
if this keeps up, we're in for a pretty great ride over the next ten years or so, despite the naysayers.
the people predicting a massive market crash a la 2008 are about as correct as the people saying that trumps presidency mirrors hitlers.
minor associations to the two when there are a ton of missing factors driving a crash like there was in 2008. while i agree that the tax plan will be great for the stock market (decreased corporate taxes equals increased profits, especially when you're nearly halving the rate), i doubt it will lead to a significant increase in jobs.
demand forces are historically the only thing that drive up jobs, not the money supply, especially when loans are so cheap with the low fed rates.
instead this will boom the stock market, and people at the top will pocket a lot of green.
they tried tax amnesty to repatriate money during the gw bush administration and hiring / pay didn't go up for the middle/lower classes.
companies instead engaged in stock buybacks and executive bonuses which only helps inflate the stock market.
if they really wanted to spur more jobs, they'd significantly cut taxes on the lower brackets instead of the higher ones.
poor and middle class spend more of their money, so more money goes into buying products and services rather than mostly entering the investment pool like it typically does with the super rich.
companies are forced to hire more people and expand to meet demand.
i feel then argument that companies making record profits and the upper class that are richer than almost any point in history need a huge tax break to trickle down on us is absurd and insulting to anyone with critical thinking skills at this point.
you say the economy is fine.
why are interest rates still so low?
shell-shock from the last recession.
the fed will be raising rates systematically over the next year or so, but no one wanted to raise them until they were absolutely positive the market could sustain it, in my opinion.
the fact that they are going to raise rates even though inflation figures don't necessarily warrant it, is especially encouraging as it could possibly put us in a much stronger position when the next recession hits.
it means that the fed is seeing the economy as exceptionally strong in that it can absorb the reduction of quantitative easing, not only as a reaction to the current market necessarily, but also in preparation for the future.
all my opinion, but there it is.
its hard not to see a crash, the market has been heading that way anyways.
this bill does nothing but make it worse.
employment is up, but wages remain stagnant.
the housing market is exclusively reacting to the renter's market becoming so inflated, and the removal of the property tax deduction is going to kill the housing market in the ne, california, and the pacific nw, the economic backbone of the country.
this bill alone, and the amount of underwater home owners the property tax adjustment could cause, is more than enough to torpedo the still tepid, but recovering housing marke.t hopefully the fed raises interest rates, otherwise they will have literally no wiggle room to mitigate another crash, but this will effectively negate a large portion of the supposed trickle down effect of this legislation.
jobless claims fall around the holidays, always.
but the economy has undeniably accelerated, considering q3 gdp was at 3.9% not a fan, but people forget that there are large numbers of unemployed that fall off the "jobless claims" numbers.
that number is rising.
you want to look at the total number of unemployed people, whether filing for unemployment or not.
the u-6 measure is down, and is actually at its lowest point in over a decade.
right now, it's at 7.9%.
1. the government unemployment numbers include people who are not on unemployment.
2. these are initial jobless claims.
people falling off unemployment wouldn't effect this number.
the bls unemployment report that comes out tomorrow is the important one, but this is a good sign.
it's still rising?
so unemployment is even worse now than it was under obama?
that's the only way to read it.
thanks trump.
everyone is giving up.
1/5 adult males today are jobless.
society is so busy caring about women in stem that they don't give a shit about the people who're actually suffering in today's economy.
[deleted] considering zero economic policies from this congress have kicked in, no, it probably has very little to do with this congress or the president.
probably thanks to the previous president.
obamas economy kicking in.
trump comes in and kills all of obama's regulations/bullshit and the economy soars.
liberals response, obviously this is because of obama.
if by "soars" you means "grows at about the rate it has the past 4 years," sure, it "soared."
what do you mean?
this year was the first time it maintained a steady growth over 1%.
how the fuck isn't that soared?
because you measure it year over year, not by how steady it is.
the most optimistic projections put annual growth .3% over 2015 numbers.
that's not insubstantial, but it's not "soared."
economic growth is at 3.1 (that's realistic which is already over .3%), last year it was 1.6. year before it was 2.6 which was obama's record high.
so from 1.6 to 3.1, it has "soared".
what regulations has he killed?
here's a [list](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-administration-cancels-hundreds-of-obama-era-regulations/2017/07/20/55f501cc-6d68-11e7-96ab-5f38140b38cc_story.html?utm_term=.0cbfac3a3423) did you read this?
he has scrapped planned regulations that never went into effect, but he hasn't killed any that are already established.
no, that was when they laid out the plan for the regulations he was going to kill, which he did.
that was back in july.
stock market is now reflecting it.
was it a pinky swear?
because those are rock solid as long as they promise.. it is crazy how much plastic ends up in the ocean.
are countries just dumping it in there directly?
is it barges losing it?
i am really dumb as to the reasons so much ends up there.
it's about time someone stopped that wasteful ocean but the million dollar question is...are any of those 200 the ones actually causing the problem?
start at home.
stop buying plastic
tripadvisor's response misses the point: consumers aren't worried about showing up to fake restaurants so much as relying on a system that is so easily manipulated and faked.
i've eaten in london.
that's not much of a trick.
i've never ended up eating in some guys shack, i have followed reviews that led to some pretty horrific shit holes.
for some odd reason, my authentic reviews never seem to show up... there has got to be a better way!
this summer at joe's crap shack dive head first into a bucket of flange.
...people put out christmas gifts this far from christmas?
yes, esp if you have kids.
gives them lots of time to ooo and ahh and get excited over presents.
it’s easier to wrap them than hide them why does it matter?
some do.
my family usually doesn’t because we have cats and a small child, but my grandparents do for the show of it.
my friends did it one year because they were moving shortly after christmas and celebrated early.
most people put christmas gift under the tree weeks before christmas.
she must have really liked opening gifts.
its nice to see margot kidder landed on her feet that's just because another family was in her house taking her presents.
...an ironic consequence of their high efficiency.
i renovated my house and put in all leds everywhere.
the electric bill is cheaper, but the lack of heat is noticeable.
a desk lamp used to be able to somewhat warm up a bedroom if the door was closed.
yep the primary source of light in my living room is four giant standing lamps.
switched over to led's in the summer which was nice, but come winter i noticed big time.
are you serious that seems crazy to me.
lights and lamps really produce that much heat?
almost all the energy used by traditional filament bulbs is emitted as heat, not light.
iirc, they have something like 10% efficiency at converting electricity to light.
worse than that.
[typically less than 5% light:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/incandescent_light_bulb?wprov=sfla1) [here’s a generic led bulb that is equivalent in brightness to a 60-watt led](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/b00bxbgg76).
note that this bulb actually uses only 10 watts of energy, despite putting out the same amount of energy in light (which brightness is a measure of).
this means that 50 watts of pure heat generation were saved.
for reference, the toaster oven sitting in my kitchen puts out a maximum of 1000 watts, and that’s at its burn-food-to-a-crisp setting.
that means that, by replacing 20 normal light bulbs with leds, over the course of about 15 minutes i’ve saved enough energy to blacken a few slices of pizza.
just imagine what that can do over the course of a year, and then if every house in your city did the same thing.
that’s a lot of energy saved.
(i realize i’m playing fast and loose with efficiencies and things here, but the general idea remains the same) probably better idea is that a small space heater can use around 1500 watts i use an old hp server.
works like a charm!
i mine buttcoins and fold proteins in the winter.
folding in winter, dos games in summer (surprisingly good backwards compatibility).
won't fold much with 10 year old hardware, but it sure tries.
it always gives me a kick to see it do "serious computer" things, like it was meant to.
&gt; mine buttcoins ... in the winter finally, a use for bitcoins other than speculating!
for everyone else: did you know that the bitcoin network now uses more electricity than 154 out of 219 countries!
the power used in one transaction could power the average us family home for a week.
i saw an article recently stating those facts.
but i'm curious how they arrived at the per transaction power usage.
bitcoin doesn't have anything measured in a per-transaction method, rather, it's per-block, which contains numerous transactions (think of a block like a new page in a ledger, and the number-crunching is the network agreeing that the submitted sheet is the authentic next page in sequence).
the amount of energy to "solve" a block is highly variable, and i don't think you could just take an average power use for any given block and divide that by the number of transactions.
that seems an ill-conceived approach.
&gt; the power used in one transaction could power the average us family home for a week.
which should really be the nail in the coffin for the idea of bitcoin replacing other currencies.
the cost of a credit card transaction or handing someone cash, even if you take into account the manufacture of the credit card machine or the cash/coin, is basically negligible unless you're paying purely in pennies.
if the cost of a transaction if $4, then what's the point in buying day to day items with it?
if i can't buy day to day items with it, is it a useful currency?
and if it's purely something that you put money into as an "investment", well, what are you investing in?
also, as long as we're shilling for big led, leds are dimmable (sometimes) and don't contain toxic mercury that needs special disposal like fluorescent tubes.
sometimes technology is just better in every way.
except the snowy traffic lights.
there's some things they need to work on.
the dimming thing isn't all the way there yet (pro tip it's probably your old rheostat) my biggest issue is the warmth (or ice coldness) of led.
i hope they keep working on making them warmer because i really miss incandescent warmth.
i don't want my house to be lit up like a grocery store or hospital or.
i understand that standard socket bulbs are okay but specialty sockets are hard to find, especially replacements for track lighting halogen and things like stovehood light bulbs, decorative lights, etc.
they have warm light leds now, for the last 5 years at least i wouldn't think it's be too hard to put in a heater system.
even the light emitted eventually turns to heat when the light hits objects and not all of it is reflected.
the only parts that don't heat the house are the rays that escape to the outside.
so it is probably more like 9 watts of heat from the led and 59 watts of heat from the incandescent.
definitely... nasa actually theorized that you could heat a 10' room to around 90 degrees with just a single 100w incandescent bulb if the walls of the room had a coating of aerogel just 1 inch thick.
here is an interesting article written by a man who did that to his living room https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/11/24/diy_insulation_with_aerogel/ the deeper article you want to click-through to: http://www.earth.org.uk/superinsulating-our-living-room.html 15 60w bulbs emit as much heat as a small space heater, or a larger one set on 'low'.
about as much as a toaster oven.
an led fixture that emits the same amount of light as a 60w incandescent bulb only uses 8-10w.
fifteen of these would only emit as much heat as an xbox 360. every watt of electricity you use in your house will become heat.
so 800w of electric motors, stereo systems, computers, fans, ect will heat up a sealed room as much as an 800w heater would.
this is why one end of your air conditioner has to be outside, because it works by pumping heat from one side to to the other.
have you ever heard of a little thing called the e-z-bake oven?
hell, my computer usually kept my room ~10 degrees warmer than the rest of the house.
but yeah lights do produce that much heat.
i use a lot of traditional light bulbs (instead of actual heat bulbs) on some reptile tanks that like it just a bit warmer than temperate for that reason 40 to 100 watts depending on the bulb.
a small 5-15sq-ft heater (most of a small room) will do wonders for a workspace in an efficient home.
it's only temporary and a more localized heat zone.
they make led lights that also emit heat.
i had a set of jw speaker led lights on my rubicon and they heated the front lens.
the new truck-lite headlights also have a built in heated lens.
i swear i've read articles about this same issue every winter for at least the last 3 years.
that's because you have.
in cold climates they usually have heaters built in.
no, they have put bubble shaped plastic covers over the lights to prevent the snow from packing in over the lights cover.
https://imgur.com/gallery/cugyw it’s both.
electronics don’t like the extreeeeeeeeem cold so some electronics built for cold climates have heaters built in.
you have yeah, i remember reading an article about a city in japan having the exact same issue a year or two back.
i think they ended up putting heating elements in the lights to help melt the snow.
pretty simple traffic law, when the light doesn't function you treat it as a 4 way stop.
of course when only one side thinks its functioning you have a serious problem on your hands.
remember this being part of the discussion when cleveland was evaluating changing.
i'm surprised minny would even try it.
&gt; pretty simple traffic law, when the light doesn't function you treat it as a 4 way stop.
of course when only one side thinks its functioning you have a serious problem on your hands.
serious question, is there a law for this situation?
4 ways stop is when the lights are not working such as due to power failure, but snow covered light would be for one lane.
how would the driver proceed?
assume 4 ways stop and hope the cross road doesn't have green?
cross road traffic may not be aware of problem since they likely can see lights normally and traffic lights aren't designed so one driver could see all 4 sides at once.
you wait for there to be an accident and someone to come out and fix it.
this is minnesota.
so you courteously wave others through until you are eventually forced to abandon your car.
i don't know that there is.
i think you'd just have to watch what the oncoming traffic is doing and cross your fingers or we could put a small heating element in stoplights to melt the snow when it's cold... no, that’s craziness.
perhaps we could invent a device that both emits light and gets warm.
and waste all the energy when it's not cold?
but that involves people actually knowing the rules of the road and not feeling that the road is theirs first... which i’m not sure even exists anymore there’s a driving test to get the license.
eh?
that most people take once as a teen then forget all of the rules within the next few years.
they forget as soon as they leave the dmv californian here, don't believe so.
based on this comment you must have gotten your license more than 45 or 50 minutes ago.
source: californian.
most people take that test *once* in their life at around 16 or so.
and like all tests, they study for it to pass, not to learn the content of the subject.
16 years later, the 32 year old has likely gotten into the habit of driving every day, and developed some driving techniques that are down right wrong.
by the time they are 48 (my age), again sixteen years later, the laws may have changed, or they simply no longer care about anything but getting from where they are to where they are going and damn those who get in their way.
of course they have to pay insurance, but insurance for a 48 year old is cheaper than it is for a 16 year old, even if the 16 year old has a perfect driving record.
it's why i'm in favor of the idea that every time you have to renew your driver's license, you have to take the written and driving exam again, or you don't get to renew it.
i can't tell you how many times i've stopped at a light that was out due to power outage and had the person behind me lay on their horn and flip me off.
same here in the dc area, only i've had them go as far as jump out of their cars to yell at me because they nearly ass-ended me.
same goes for when i stop at crosswalks.
my brother has had the same problem only he's a police officer and will make them pull over and wait while he teaches them motor vehicle law if he's not in a hurry.
so what if the lights going one directly only are covered in snow, how does traffic coming the other way have any clue things are fucked?
this is one example of a place where led's might not have been the best choice.
if the light is covered in your direction you treat it as a stop sign.
if opposing traffic isn't yielding, you don't go through your stop sign.
this is exactly what happens.
seen it firsthand as a minnesotan in the last two snowstorms.
happens here in the chicago area too.
the simple solution is install the heaters, lose the efficiency but gain not having to replace them as often.
also use up the stocks of existing bulbs first.
i remember first reading about this issue over in milwaukee about four years ago also, it's only lost efficiency when they are needed.
they're not on for no reason in the summer.
if you are constantly waiting you realize there is a problem thats when all sides start getting involved.
if you are a local you know how the lights turn so you can guess.
if not all cars start to edge out until the ones going through stop and the other 3 work out who is next.
people get it working eventually, humans are good at this.
what, you mean the snow doesn't blow in four different directions at the same place and time?
living near cleveland and having been to chicago and st. cloud during the winter, i can confirm that it does, lol.
not that often though.
this works fine when *a* light is out, but if it is a problem that spreads across a city, even a small one, then it becomes a different kind of problem due to emerging properties.
think massive gridlock.
so... *"imagine if you don't live in bum-fuck-nowhere"* ^_ sincerely; people who live with traffic.
not if you live someplace that actually gets snow.
these things aren't able to do the job without the extra crap they've tossed on them here to keep snow from building up in the first place.
how can you call is a simple traffic law when you immediately provide a reason why it isn't simple?
part of the problem with this, that i’ve seen firsthand in the last two snowstorms here in mn is that usually only one directions of lights are obstructed, so the for the other three directions, it’s business as usual because they don’t know any better.
this right here... the 4 way stop only works when all 4 ways are aware the lights are obstructed.
when the snow is blowing one direction, 2 or 3 directions will still see a green or red light.
minnesotans don’t understand “simple” traffic laws.
the simple rule of left turn yield on green was too complicated, so now we have installed flashing yellow arrows for left turns... sometimes i make a joke at a red light saying, i can make a left here on red.
well, jokes on me because a few weeks ago i was at a red light in left turning lane.
some guy honked me.
i was like wtf.
he does it again.
and the i see the sign.
left on red allowed after stop.
i never saw that before.
&gt; left on red allowed after stop.
in most states, from one way street to one way street.
that makes sense.
i just never saw a sign like that before.
michigan is just onto a one way street.
i've been living in this state for a while and i will say minnesota drivers are far better than texas drivers.
lol non-california people saying how bad their drivers are.
nj is worse than cali.
nj is cali in terms of driver quality.
am from nj, have driven to and through cali.
neither are as bad as ny, and no one is as bad as mass.
just holy crap, people in mass.
drive like fucking maniacs.
people in mass drive fast.
people in nj drive aggressively.
and people in cali are 50-50 to drive aggressively or super slowly.
harder to predict the cali drivers, but also less need to.
edit: lived in all three.
just moved to mass from ca.
i don't find mass drivers to be particularly fast but they are consistently assholes.
try the bay area.
hardly anyone gets pulled over ever you can just pretty much run any stop sign or light you want.
if you don't crash you can drive as you like without consequence.
look at the bottom cities: https://wallethub.com/edu/best-worst-cities-to-drive-in/13964/ new england drivers are worse.
i was in la a few months ago and thought the drivers were way better then tampa fl.
almost saw a motorcycleist become a fucking splat on the freeway yesterday.
the freeway was packed, but it was moving at a good 50-55mph.
i look over my shoulder and see this motorcycle lane splitting, flying up from maybe 25-50?
yards behind (he had to have been doing over 75).
i look back forward and see this red car about 4 car lengths ahead with his left blinker on, who then starts getting over, no chance to even see this moron on the bike.
luckily the bike was able to get left of the red car, and then left onto the shoulder.
if there hadn't been a gap, the dude would have been fucking toast.
what kind of fucking idiot lane splits in 55 mph traffic, going 20-30mph faster than everyone else?!
i swear the further south you go the worse people are at driving, and the further north you go people drive more like assholes.
i tend to agree.
lots of asshole drivers by me, but not as many accidents as i saw when i was in florida.
on straight roads too.
all the time in the same areas.
impatient and because everything is so open i don't think they learn the good defensive driving skills one needs to understand in a big city.
oh my god, florida saw two separate single car accidents where the car flipped exiting the highway on a cloverleaf exit.
i don't know if you're familiar with the ucf area, but there's a long main road call alafaya trail.
everyday there would be accidents.
and it's a straight road, and to turn there are openings.
people need to learn what mirrors are for.
cause that's the only way these accidents can occur.
just wait til it snows.
heh, last time i was driving in texas, people in jacked up pickup trucks would drive around me in the grass whenever i came to a red light on an exit ramp.
just right over the curb, onto the grass and around the stopped traffic and onto the road.
i thought it was a fluke, but then it happened several times in the same day.
native minnesotan living in denver.
denver drivers are worse.
advanced greens are really good for places where there's a lot of people that need to turn left.
places in suburban atlanta did this, too.
now people with no oncoming traffic just sit, confused by the flashing arrow, waiting for it to turn green.
i'm pretty sure flashing yellow is used for left turn lanes where there is not an option to go strait.
typically, a single set of traffic lights is used to control all lanes from one direction.
green means you have the row going straight, but turning traffic must yield.
it has always been that way.
but for some reason, some cities thought it was a good idea to put a separate light above _every single lane_, necessitating a special flashing yellow light for turning traffic.
the only legitimate use of these lights i can think of is where traffic cannot continue forward, but _can_ turn while yielding to other traffic.
for example, on king street in toronto, which recently started a pilot project that forces motorists to turn right at the end of every block in order to optimise the streetcar route.
the current situation is a green light with some signs restricting left turns and straight-throughs, which is not ideal because people don't see the signs.
this is not a common situation.
i'm not convinced any of you motorists understand traffic laws.
and here i am living in north minneapolis where most of the lights i see are specifically labeled for no right turn on red in louisiana, drivers don't even know what an arrow is.
no joke.
i pulled over to check on an accident with no police around yet and one of the drivers asked, "what is an arrow?".
well, louisiana also decided that a ziplock bag counters as a closed container, so what are you going to do?
well you can only see the arrow if you look up from your phone.
a lot of places do this.
that is most states bub this is a federal thing.
they are being installed across the country.
that makes too much sense.
just like slower moving cars should stay in the right lane but there’s always slow pokes in the passing lane doing 5 under.
it never works smoothly in practice.
the big 8+ way intersections are nightmares when the lights go down.
it takes one sheepish person or an inconsiderate asshole and it just shuts down.
&gt; i'm surprised minny would even try it.
the financial savings of led are just too enticing.
the ultimate solution will be thermostatically controlled heaters.
the amount of energy needed to prevent snow blocking would still be far less through the snow season than incandescent energy use.
yeah as long as it ultimately pays off in electrical costs that makes sense.
old bulbs probably aren't the most efficient heat source.
unfortunatly i've come to the sad realisation that people simply don't know how to operate a 4-way stop.
that's true, even at stop signs it somehow seems like a struggle sometimes.
flashing red light?...forget about it, lol it all comes crashing down as soon as it becomes more than one lane in each direction.
simply too inefficient.
usually when this happens, i see about 5-10 cars taking turns to go through the intersection at a time.
even 1 lane in each direction seems to complicated for people nowadays.
i remember when they first mentioned introducing right turn on red lights in the city, the mayor at the time said that he was hesitant to do so because he felt drivers would need to seriously behave better for this to work.
boy was he right, they put it in effect and 10 years later people still don't know how to do it properly.
or install traffic circles.
no lighted controls then.
i live near bend, oregon ..they have a ton of them.
i'm not a fan of them in the winter.
i feel like they are far more dangerous in places that get ice.
sw michigan.
we have them here.
the issue with snow is that if the plows don't pay attention, trucks will get stuck in them with longer trailers.
accidents in circles are less likely to be severe.
sliding through a circle won't create a t-bone like an intersection would.
but yes, for moderate density intersection, traffic circles are immune to issues with lights.
ha i went to high school in bend.
there was a roundabout near my school.
probably a dozen times in the winter, i would start to slide in the same spot in that one roundabout.
not sure why that one in particular, i went through like 7 on that trip.
never got out of control though (always made it where i was planning on going and stayed on the road), and i got used to it (and slowed down).
honestly yeah they aren't great in ice but i've had worse close calls at stop lights and stop signs.
at least roundabouts often you don't have to stop (which can be hard to do with ice).
worst problem for me was one time i was driving up the hill on reed market at the stoplight for the parkway ramp, i was barely able to accelerate and get going, i had to floor it for like 5 seconds before i started moving.
not sure how cost effective that would be in the short term it's not.
i dunno the real cost, but i'd image well into the several hundred thousand per intersection.
long term, it's probably a net societal gain due to lower ongoing maintenance, lower accident rates, etc.
it is rather comical to see people who haven't a clue drive around them.
i almost got hit a year ago because somebody backed up in one.
the other failure mode is that people assume it is basically a 4 way yield (for smaller circles).
they don't know that right of way is ceded to the person in the circle.
so i've entered a circle, only to have people blow the yield right in front of me - without even looking left.
but because it's a traffic circle, speeds where low enough that i could slow down and miss them.
but the part of town the circles are in - i basically assume drivers are idiots and drive with an extra measure of defensiveness.
there aren't many close to wear i live, only in the city centers of old little towns, so the first time i encountered one in jersey (that have a lot of them), i was a bit bewildered too.
it's just like a scaled down free-way merge.
the car on the left has right of way.
as someone who lives in a place where we don't get a lot of snow..... this scenario really bothers me on a personal level i had that issue last winter.
my light was fine but the cross traffic light was blocked by snow.
i was nearly hit multiple times thinking people were going to stop.
that was some butt clenching stuff right there.
that should not be standard practice every time it snows.
something needs to melt the snow.
agree.
i wasn't under the impression this happened that frequently though.
there's still some heat emitted and the surfaces, i can only imagine are designed for this not to happen.
probably only a problem in the wet, sticky sideways snow the midwest gets sometimes.
minny?
i've lived here my entire life and not once have i ever heard anyone refer to mn or mpls as minny.
wtf?
certainly didn't mean any offense.
i'm from ohio and have heard the term used in the context of professional sports reasonably regularly.
perhaps we're just still bitter about what ahmad rashad did to us in december 1980. lol, this worked very well when i lived in pittsburgh, pa, but when i moved to the dc area a decade ago i've yet to see anyone abide by this when lights are out, even once, and they're out here more frequently than in pittsburgh.
i think it's a two-fold problem, 1) the population in the dc area never learned/doesn't care about the motor laws in this country, and/or 2) the average driver in the dc area has very little if any understanding or desire to abide by any concepts related to common courtesy.
seriously, everyone's out for themselves to the point where even mentioning someone's lack of courtesy will be met with blank stares at best, violence or threat of violence at worst, with the violence coming from the person in the wrong.
this is a problem that can be solved by $5 worth of heat trace.
we've been doing this for ages.
never heard of these before - would these work for heating an outdoor cat shelter made mostly of wood?
no, they're not meant to heat the air.
they're meant to heat whatever they're in contact with so it doesn't freeze or develop a layer of ice.
and you need an electrical connection (trivial for a traffic light, less so for a cat shelter).
so you're saying to cover the cat with it and strap it up with a battery pack?
i've seen this movie, it ends with a robot cat coming back in time to kill john conner.
do you do industrial heat tracing?
i've installed a lot of outdoor equipment, crankcase heaters, heat trace on water lines, etc.
are all very common.
you might think it's something exotic, but no, it's a wire that gets hot when you run electricity through it - just like the incandescent bulbs get hot when you run electricity through them (essentially it's a crappy wire).
only thing is, you can run it only when there's danger of ice build up, and 99% of the year save an enormous amount of electricity.
solid state, no moving parts, i've never seen heat trace fail outside of actual physical damage to the wire.
&gt; you might think it's something exotic, but no, it's a wire that gets hot when you run electricity through it they're basically durable resistors.
resistors turn electricity into heat as a matter of course.
most of the time, it's waste heat, some of the times it's wanted heat.
that's all heating elements essentially are - resistors.
really simple technology that's been around as long as electrical engineering.
i've only seen it in industrial applications but i live in texas so maybe that's why i've never seen it elsewhere or maybe i don't pay attention enough.
now i can spot an un level conduit from a mile away but that's only because i primarily do electrical.
if there's any heat trace in texas it's probably because the vendor delivered it to you pretraced by accident.
you really don't need it until you get below freezing for extended periods of time.
oh!
cars often have it on their rear windows to defrost the windows, you've probably seen the thin black lines there.
that's really fine heat trace wire, but it should be a similar principle for a traffic light.
edit: [here's a metric asston of it, you usually don't need this much](http://www.offshore-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/09/pentair-cables-lg.jpg) we don't get below freezing here but maybe every 4yrs.
i know about defroster lines and heat trace in general just never seen it in use outside of industrial applications besides defroster lines.
probably more common than you think.
big building?
unless you see people shovelling snow up there they probably have some kind of heat tracing system to remove the shit tonne of snow.
it doesn't snow where i'm from, yesterday we got our first bit of colder weather.
are those wires the same things that cars have on their rear windows for defrosting?
yup.
they'd work fine for defrosting traffic light glass too.
it's just a silly oversight.
i looked into this before and had a "simple" solution (not really simple since it does cost money to replace these lights).
redesign the traffic lights to be oriented horizontally instead of vertically (so red yellow green goes from left to right instead of top to bottom).
remove the bottom half of the "cone" around the lights allowing snow to drop down instead of collecting.
too simple.
we need something that costs millions to design and millions more to implement.
source : used to work for government.
they don't decide the cost and complexity, that's up to the contractors.
or a simple heating circuit?
a thermistor (electrical thermometer) to control a heating system like your car mirrors.
set it to come on below a set temperature.
relatively cheap if incorporated into mass production of replacement lamps.
it would also be possible to retrofit a heating board behind the lamp but less efficient and cost to fit.
oh, i bet that's why wisconsin has horizontal lights!
they're designed almost exactly as you describe.
you mean like this ?
http://www.orangetraffic.com/wp-content/uploads/images%20produits/models/ot-feux-circulation-a-web.jpg not one engineer thought to put some form of heating/de-icing element on those things!?
i'm an intern at an elecrical engineering firm in fairbanks alaska, and everyone at the office hates heat trace.
it's expensive, and a massive power sink.
the whole reason to switch over to led lamps is to save power, so adding more electrical load by placing down heat trace seems pretty counter productive.
i'm not totally sure, as i don't have the numbers in front of me, but i wouldn't be surprised if the heat traced leds have equal or worse efficient than the older less efficient lamps.
or at lest not enough energy saving to justify the added cost.
ie: a payback time of longer than 15 years or something similar.
remember, the extra heat is only needed when snow buildup is present.
the rest of the year is saving money on electricity and bulb replacement labor.
say the baseline was a 150w bulb.
now there is a 10w led and 190w heater.
that heater only needs to run for ~3-4 months of the year - less if there is a thermal sensor someplace in the system.
still a net savings.
wasn't this already addressed years ago?
i though heating elements were standard in these lights, since the heat output is gone.
how is this news?
breaking - water is wet.
this is why modern railroad signals have one large and deep shroud that is wider at the bottom.
railroads learned long ago that the new led lamps can't melt the snow.
wonder if a hydrophobic coating on the light and enclosure would have an appreciable effect - also how long that would stay on it over time.
well new fodder for /r/conspiracy **led lights dont melt snowflakes!
** just hope the solution is not to install 1000w heaters to blow on the lights.
but in these times you never know.
it might not be a bad idea to install a heating element that kicks in when the temp drops under a certain point.
it wouldn't necessarily take any more power than the traditional bulbs did and it wouldn't need to be turned on more than a few months out the year anyway.
the cost of the system would increase greatly though.
you'd have to weigh it against the energy expenses of traditional bulbs.
i think it'd come out ahead after a time, but the initial cost to fit and replace every stop light is going to be expensive.
long term infrastructure projects are generally a good thing though.
haha, no.
the heat tape is cheap and it's on a thermostat.
it consumes far less than a light bulb when the heater is activated.
a single light is also cheap but when you times it by a billion it starts to get expensive.
so is changing incandescent bulbs on a regular basis, which is the costly reason that they changed in the first place.
the energy savings are just a bonus.
yes, adding up the labor cost of frequently changing incandescent bulbs and their power consumption, the leds win even with augmented heating.
i personally own a few different kinds of traffic lights and the bulbs are 300 watt with very thick filaments with metal reflectors inside.
these consume a *lot* of energy.
compared to an led with a heater there is no contest.
the led with heater is easily a small fraction of the power consumption of the old incandescent bulbs.
the heater only runs when it's cold, so it's a win-win.
you don't need a lot of heat.
a bone dead simple thing like a niachrome wire near the lights, with even a simple sensor to turn it on or off would likely fix the issue.
as there's likely already a control system, the small heaters could probably be controlled from a central location, so it was only on when there was precipitation or similar, to save the most energy.
they should have made the lights with those wires that they use in the rear window of cars.
turn on during a snowstorm.
turn off after its over.
they do.
not all jurisdictions buy them.
well that's pretty short-sighted.
now if they want to upgrade them, it'll cost more money than if they just installed those the first time.
yes, but that's their fault, but it's due to not knowing the future.
to be fair, it probably didn't occur to everyone that icing would be a problem with these low-power lamps.
the railroads learned this the hard way and their new signals addressed it with a robust shroud (also, historically, the railroads place the red light on the bottom of the three-light units to avoid it being obscured by snow and ice in any case).
easy solution: include a small heating element.
some frosty neighborhoods have that on street lamps.
they should put covers topside of the lens, not only to protect from weather but to limit upward facing light pollution.
it's as simple as installing a heating element that is remotely controlled from the traffic control center.
use a drone with a blow torch to clear ‘em.
can confirm.
have led headlights on my jeep.
have to get out and wipe the snow off every 10 fucking minutes.
city planners are so smart!
smrt!
they did this in my town in colorado to save money on electricity only to end up spending more money heating the lights so snow didn’t cover them.
haha, no.
it still saves energy most of the year (they are on thermostats) and the heating element consumes far less than the old light bulb did.
til - people can't do math in this thread.
say the baseline was a 200w incandescent bulb.
now there are a few 9w leds in there.
just add a ~180w heater - that only needs to run for a few months of the year.
bonus if the heater is attached directly to the lens, now it's more thermally efficient than before.
i own a few surplus traffic lights, some of which came with the original bulbs.
they were rated 300 watts and the filaments were really thick.
standing in front of them you can feel the heat through your jacket.
&gt; they did this in my town in colorado to save money on electricity only no, they did it because the incandescent light bulbs have to be changed on a regular basis, which is expensive.
the energy savings are a nice bonus.
i mean, the designing engineers would have done a return on investment analysis of the led lamps, and given a time line of when the leds would effectivly pay for themselves.
highly doubt this agree.
i’ve seen snow covered traffic lights so heavily covered they were impossible to discern if the driver didnt pay close attention.
*yesss, yesss, goooood* [deleted] runways wouldn't be allowable per the faa, unless something has changed.
led taxiway lighting is allowed, however.
flexible printed film thermistors could solve this problem fairly easily.
they're already used in the auto industry to heat side mirrors, and the devices are stupidly easy to make.
of course, hooking them up to thermostats and installing them into stoplights would probably require a total redesign of the stoplight housing unless a clever retrofit could be devised.
source: personal experience with the technology platform shouldn't the older lights that have one bulb in a box on the corner of the street, and fiber optic lines running to the lenses, have this problem too?
i'm too lazy to solve this problem should’ve gotten the lights with built in heating filaments.
just need someone on top of the lights with a hair dryer.
boom solved.
on the npr show “car talk” click and clack talked about this happening in cambridge, massachusetts years ago.
cambridge went back to incandescent.
weird that other cities are repeating the mistake.
there hard enough to see to begin with, there is one intersection with leds near me and you can't really see the color till your almost under it especially on sunny days.
i can't imagine the pain they are going through.
even if you have an evac plan, it takes time to get all those animals out.
grass fires are so quick, especially with the wind backing it up.
they probably barely had time to get themselves out.
if this is the same facility i'm thinking of i believe they also do horse therapy for children with autism.
they used to use old retired horses to walk with the kids or let the kids ride them.
those kids really needed that.
i hope this isn't the end for that kind of thing.
this is absolutely tragic.
my sincere condolences for the owners of the horses lost, and the keepers of the ranch.
executives being responsible if their corporation commits crimes is good, just that it only applies in this one specific case is so weird well america suing a german competing company?
sure if they were american it would have gone different yes, in america they probably would have gotten a raise aww yes the american way stomping out competition rather then compete anything american is becoming shit vw could have been fined out of existence in the us.
they were facing something like 500 billion in fines since each car sold was illegal.
america deserves a lot of criticism for being anticompetitive douche bags but here is not a solid example.
ic thanks for knowledge for knowledge is power remember the "unintended acceleration" thing from toyota that obama attacked so strongly?
just a coincidence that he had just illegally transferred ownership of gm to the uaw, one of his biggest donors.
&gt; coincidence that he had just illegally transferred ownership of gm to the uaw maybe one day you'll get tired of alex jones lying to you.
have someone read this to you.
https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/the-auto-bailout-and-the-rule-of-law http://www.heritage.org/testimony/bailouts-abusive-bankruptcies-and-the-rule-law nationalaffairs.com and heritage.org think tank?
more like *stink* tank!
&lt;billy madison face&gt; but really, its reputation is [a shell of what it once was.
](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/09/the-fall-of-the-heritage-foundation-and-the-death-of-republican-ideas/279955/) &gt;but there is more at stake in heritage’s transformation from august policy shop to political hit squad than the reputation of a d.c. think tank or even the careers of a few squishy gop politicians.
it is the intellectual project of the conservative movement itself.
without heritage, the gop’s intellectual backbone is severely weakened, and the party’s chance to retake its place as a substantive voice in american policy is in jeopardy.
the reality is few people will look at heritage as anything other than the pr arm of a few multi-billionaires, a reputation they've earned in more recent years.
i did read through the national affairs article though.
it offered up some very reasonable concerns and criticisms that i wouldn't normally come across.
it didn't however get anywhere close to this (illegally transferred ownership of gm to the uaw) statement.
who read it for you?
wow, a crooked executive going to prison for corruption that hurt people.
that's really interesting.
.
.as an american, i've never seen that.
.
.although should have many times over.
&gt; as an american, i've never seen that were you not around during enron?
that was some of mueller's handiwork and he did not fuck around.
my guess is that this guy worked for the wrong corporation.
if it was an american company my guess is that they wouldn't even check the emissions.
ummmm...yeah they would've.
they were caught because researchers at wvu were, ironically, doing a paper on how great vw diesel engines were...then realized that the engines were awful.
it was at that point they had realized that they were doing real world tests (i.e.
driving the car out on public roads under various loads and conditions as one would in normal, everyday driving) while epa tests are confined within labs and are heavily controlled which lead the researchers to believe that vw was cheating somehow and tipped off the epa.
so it had nothing to do with the fact that it was a company based out of the us and more to do with the fact that, prior to this scandal, vw had a reputation of building the most efficient diesel engines on the planet.
these days it really doesn't matter where your main headquarters is, vw hires many americans, has a plant in tennessee and has a large us corporate headquarters just minutes from dulles international airport.
&gt; they were caught because researchers at wvu were, ironically, doing a paper on how great vw diesel engines were...then realized that the engines were awful.
which is why there's a concerted attack on research institutions in the us.
interesting care to link the source.
if thats the case vw forgot the first rule of cheating, dont pass the test with such flying colors it looks suspicious.
here you go, from [npr](https://www.npr.org/2015/09/24/443053672/how-a-little-lab-in-west-virginia-caught-volkswagens-big-cheat).
an excerpt: &gt;wvu research assistant professor arvind thiruvengadam and his colleagues test and experiment on cars and engines.
he admits his is not the sexiest lab on campus, but he says he got superexcited when they won a grant in 2012 to test a few diesel cars.
&gt;"our happiness was, 'wow, we are going to be the first guys to test diesel cars on the road,' " he says.
"and then after that, when we were getting the data we were like 'ok, we're going to write a lot of journal papers, and we'll be happy if three people read these journal papers.'
that's our happiness at that point."
&gt;the international council on clean transportation is a nonprofit that tries to provide independent science to government agencies that regulate the environment.
it hired the university to do a standard emissions tests on diesel cars in the u.s. volkswagen has been hyping diesel cars that are environmentally friendly and fuel efficient.
volkswagen had the boldest claims and the highest sales, but thiruvengadam tested two vw cars and found that the claims of low emissions never panned out in the real world.
&gt;"we were never seeing those low emissions during most part of our drives on the interstate.
that part of the emissions program was interesting," he says.
&gt;in none of their road tests could they get their two volkswagen cars to meet the claims, even though a bmw they tested did fine.
very early on it was pretty clear to the scientists that something was wrong.
i can think of several ceo’s that have been sent to prison just off the top of my head.
yeah..."prison."
more like guarded resort.
how did it hurt people?
you candy ass liberals are dumb.
it helped fuel economy and performance.
see what we can accomplish when candy ass liberals don't get involved u/breskve said: &gt; how did it hurt people?
you candy ass liberals are dumb.
it helped fuel economy and performance.
see what we can accomplish when candy ass liberals don't get involved i know it's frustrating when we don't understand things and we start losing our temper and throwing around hurtful names so i'll try to explain this in a way you can understand, okay there bud?
see, because we all share the same air.
the people at volkswagen made cars that put bad stuff in the air.
other people also put bad stuff in the air so it's really hard to measure exactly how much bad stuff is out there.
the bad stuff in the air made some normal people a little bit sick, and it made sick people even more sick.
but because it is everywhere, it's hard to point at a sick person and say "they got sick because of volkswagen bad stuff in the air!"
we know that volkswagen agrees that they did bad thing because they agreed to pay lots of money to try to make things better.
you can read more about the bad stuff in the air and the money volkswagen paid [in this article](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/volkswagen-clean-air-act-civil-settlement) but it's got some pretty big words in it so you might wanna ask your parents to read through it with you.
you're retarded.
fucking liberals just ruin what consumers want.
i have to buy more fuel because of these idiots.
that's ok i bought one of the pre recall vw back when being a man meant something someone has their poopie-pants on.
i think you need a time out, buster!
lmfao no wonder people only are your friend because they feel bad for you pumping out nox at 15-30 times the epa limit is how they were hurting people [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nox#health_and_environment_effects) lmfao who gives a shit really?
i'm not having kids and so i'm going to make my time on here the best it can be.
the epa is just bloated and is a loss for americans.
it could be argued that the very lack of freedom is what makes it unamerican typical conservative selfishness.
"i don't mind being a asshole because it doesn't hurt me, even if it will hurt somebody else!"
it’s not even just about hurting people, dude.
it’s deceptive business practices.
i own one of these cars right now and i remember telling everyone how cool it was that the fuel economy was so awesome but it was still fun to drive.
now i feel like i got played.
http://www.icopal-noxite.co.uk/nox-problem/nox-pollution.aspx hey how many years did gm execs get for trying to cover up their faulty ignition switches that actually killed people?
pretty sure zero.
engineers emailed each other calling it "the ignition switch from hell" - the problem is that they were pretty much in the middle of production when it became a known issue, if i'm not mistaken.
the switch occasionally deactivated power steering and power breaking if the keys were heavy enough, due to the way the electronics were wired, iirc.
so fucked.
had nothing to do with the way electronics were wired.
there was a specification that said at a minimum x amount of force must be required to turn the key.
their ignition came in under that.
led to heavy keychains causing the key to turn off because of their weight.
the issue was discovered and fixed, but they told nobody, issuing zero recalls.
they also didn't change the part number to easily tell defective from non defective parts.
worked at gm.
there was recalls.
yeah, wayyyyyyyyyyy later.
nope, it was all about the torque the tumbler needed to turn.
it was wrong.
but did they lie to feds?
that’s the kicker.
they kinda did.
they were supposed to report the problem to the ntsb as soon as it was discovered.
instead they covered it up.
in court that is not lying.
you can't just make up terms in a legal setting.
hence "kinda".
there's a huge difference between "trying to cover up" a defect and designing an elaborate method to deceive a regulatory body.
vw knowingly lied and polluted the planet though.
they didn't make an error.
gm knowingly covered up their error this pisses me off so much.
&gt; schmidt asked u.s. district judge sean cox to limit his sentence to 40 months, saying he’d been coached to lie about emissions by his bosses.
probably true, but even if this guy is taking the fall for people above him i'm glad it's clear that "just following orders" isn't a valid excuse.
it has a long history in germany.
lied about ~~mileage~~ emissions?
*7 years in prison* defraud taxpayers and the u.s. government?
*bailouts, tax breaks and golden parachutes all round!
* thanks to u/mrfoof82 for the correction they didn't lie about gas mileage.
they lied about emissions.
it isn't over for vw either.
not the us, but in germany, and porsche's former head of r&amp;d is just one in the crosshairs.
the former ceo of vw is under investigation, as several other very prominent individuals from the vw group.
this was the nail in the coffin for diesel.
legislation is being rolled out (or discussed) throughout europe to start phasing it out.
vw group sells tons of diesels in europe, and now looking to dump many billions into electric r&amp;d. i still think there's a massive disparity between polluting slightly more than [still quite a lot], and causing a worldwide recession that saw 6 million americans lose their homes.
it's almost like america is in the pocket of big business, finding ways to strangle the lower class for fun and profit... not like they have legalized bribery or anything.
/s gm did not cause a worldwide recession that caused americans to lose their homes.
mortgage companies, investment banks, and companies like aig did that.
gm fell due to that same recession since the last thing someone wants to do when they're going through foreclosure is to buy a new car, well that and they built shitty cars.
yeah, no shit.
i was referring to the fact that no bankers (well, wasn’t it only one, in iceland?)
or regulators went to prison despite having a hand in all the fuckups that lead to the recession.
was that not obvious?
no, but that's because i'm retarded, i agree with your point though.
the type of pollution they lied about has severe effects locally, knocking years off the lives of people in cities.
my point was that even if they hadn’t been cheating emissions tests, they would still have been kicking out all those nasty particulates you get from diesel combustion, just at slightly lower levels.
it’s not like below that threshold diesel engines are magically clean.
the levels weren’t slightly lower.
it was up to an order of magnitude (10x) difference or more for some particulates.
it’s why the punishment in the us will be seen as a footnote, as what’ll be doled out by a germany is likely going to be exceptionally brutal, as most eu countries tax vehicles based on emissions, and have had far stricter standards for a long time.
for example, the penalties levied to a manufacturer for having fleet economy worse than a certain threshold (cafe) is only 2-3% of what the eu levies for emissions related targets.
the us raised the stink, but the eu is who vw really fears (bmw also being investigated as well).
of course it isn't over, because it's not an american company because they didn't do anything actually illegal.
you might think it was but in court it didn't stick.
it's almost as if despite public opinion you have a right to defend yourself in court.
now if only we could manage to get the people responsible for not preventing the equifax and yahoo hacks locked up, we'll be making some real progress.
sadly, this guy will be made an example of and people will soon forget that nothing bad happened to any exec at any major american company within the past ten years.
this is just one of a large number of people involved, "taking one for the team".
obviously many others will go unpunished.
still, good to see at least some justice served.
remember when harley davidson did the same thing?
what hd did was different from what vw did.
vw sold cars that did not meet emissions standards stock from the get-go.
hd got in trouble for selling aftermarket parts that were only legal for off-road use and thus exempt from emissions rules knowing that people were intending to use them on the road.
a executive?!?
sounds to me like they scapegoat a guy for the doings of many i sold vws for 5 long years; we had "tdis are clean, diesels are clean" crammed down our throats constantly in training, during video training, and then passing that dogma on to consumers.
when do i get paid for being trained to lie?
&gt; when do i get paid for being trained to lie?
you already did - you were paid to do a job.
when you sue them glad he got caught, but why did he come back to the us after the scandal broke?
he was arrested while on vacation in miami.
his buddies are still in germany able to spend christmas with their families and probably avoiding travel to the us.
does he live in germany?
i know while he was employed with vw he worked in auburn hills, mi for vw of america so at least during that time he lived in the states.
does anyone know his nationality?
i know the other engineer they arrested was an american.
if this were an american company, the head honcho would have probably gotten about $700,000 in fines and that's it.
and these companies constantly train their sales forces with all this bullshit propaganda, to blatantly lie to the customer's face after getting one million in bonuses for taking the punch and murders and rapists get less time.... wonderful, nonetheless, that a top exec is being charged.
maybe it will make others think.
like maybe we can go after bank execs after the next financial crisis they bring on and us executives gets ... a massive tax cut.
welcome to trumps america this started well before trump took the helm... he sure isnt stopping it.............. do any bought and paid for politicians truly have any incentive to stop the cash flow?
just to play devils advocate.... one could argue that a rapist harms a handful of people (the victim, family, etc) while this emissions scandal arguably harms millions, possibly billions of people.
the monetary cost of the crime is exponentially larger in vws case.
it's actually pretty rare for murder to get less than 7 years.
also, what is your point?
that murderers should get more time or that the exec should get less time?
wow, a corrupt exec actually went to jail?
are we starting to make progress by holding these bastards accountable for their actions?
no - its because he is not american [deleted] you can say that again.
it's funny cause he did.
quite a few times.
were those bespoke gm parts, or were they outsourced?
as someone who works in automotive, it doesn't matter.
you're responsible for whatever product you give the customer.
i'm sure gm went and beat the shit out of the supplier if they were outsourced.
but at the end of the day their engineers, purchasing, executives, etc.. approved and bought off on it.
the problem with gm was that a single engineer changed witch switch they used and did not properly document it or change the part number.
so when gm tried to investigate and recreate the problem they had trouble even though the ignition switches were the obvious .
eventually they went to salvage yards and and slowly tried to figure out which models were affected.
compared to volkswagen no one had any idea what was going on.
they’re a evil incompetent company, but volkswagen was an evil competent one.
there's nothing inherently evil or good about companies.
they are made up of people.
there are some pricks in the industry no doubt, but most people are trying to do the right thing.
wasn't takata sued over the airbags?
i think the car companies originally claimed they were duped by takata (if that is true or not, i don't know).
but regardless, they were the ones who paid out the lawsuits.
this is complete bullshit for vw.
a few of them deserve to be in trouble, but fuck sakes, jail time?
america is fucked.
why is capital punishment not an option here?!?
things like copd and childrens asthma are directly linked to the micro-particles that get emitted by diesel vehicles.
not even mentioning that these vehicles were willingly sold by the company when they knew they shouldn't have been and what impact this will have on our environment in the long run.
we should punish the ceos just like we would punish a person who committed genocide.
you should not be allowed to treat our earth as a coincidental.
these people should be held responsible.
7 years doesn't cut it.
i still can't work out what the problem is ?
after all isn't global warming a chinese hoax ?
😉 where is the gm exec in jail for the bullshit they pulled with cobalts and g5s that actually killed people.
there were members of that jury who refused to convict.
fairly common to find 1 person out of 12 who will not/cannot vote guilty when it’s a cop.
i find that to be most concerning.
some people truly believe they can do no wrong.
and even those people get jury duty.
i’m glad one case has gotten through.
the supreme court needs to set a new standard when dealing with police killings.
with so many police shootings ending terribly, something must be done.
what does the supreme court have to do with this case?
what standard are you referring to?
[the supreme court has eveything to do with it.
](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1988/87-6571) let this be the precedence.
it's not common.
but it's not entirely uncommon either.

2017 was added to wikipedia so i included it.
this is the fourth time i've been named times person of the year.
what’s it like being a hungarian planet-computer?
ez van, ezt kell szeretni.
this saying sums up the socialist era in hungary.
("this is what is, this is what you have to like") &gt; his saying sums up the socialist era in hungary.
("this is what is, this is what you have to like") good times.
this is a question that requires deep thought probably not among the most uplifting reasons.
i've got trump beat!
"inheritors" is a way more appropriate designation than "boomers."
it sounds vaguely malevolent and creepy.
i don't know i just imagine a group of tall spindly men with scales below their throats sitting in a circular conference room discussing how they'll disrupt the economy of argentina for esoteric reasons.
this is a great description of them actually that sounds like the baby boomers to me boomers inherited a brand new highway system, education that was basically free, and all the other spoils of the greatest generation and their sacrifices.
then they spend the rest of their lives consuming and when it's time to give back what do they do?
they vote against infrastructure bills, education bills, healthcare bills.
instead they vote and pass bills that make it almost impossible to void student loan debts that they forced on future generations.
and lastly, with the last gop tax bill, they are robbing the middle and lower classes in one final tax heist.
if you're under 60 years old you better wake up before 2018 and vote these people out before they put us all in the poor house to pay for their greens fees on their 2nd and 3rd vacation homes.
it is amusing to have had to listen to boomers spend the 70s and 80s talking about how they were saving the world and spreading free love and sex, and now listen to the millennials eviscerate them for being basically selfish reactionaries.
"i won't be coming home tonight **my generation will put it right** we're not just making promises that we know, we'll never keep."
genesis, land of confusion, 1986 it wasn't a bad song, but i heard it on the radio for the first time in like a decade a week or so ago and i all i could do is go "lol".
especially in that, by pointing at the situation they were handed (by coming up just as the american economy rose to dominate a landscape basically destroyed by the war in a booming labor market) it puts the lie to the whole 'millennials are entitled' shit that assumes that if i paid for college and a down payment on a house with a steady 40-hour-a-week entry-level job (maybe with a ba, maybe nothing past high school), you can too unless you're lazy.
calling them that highlights how they came through at a time when getting ahead in america was ridiculously easy, and hints at how impossible it is now, largely because of their continuing control of corporations and economic structures.
come on, my parent's worked hard to pay totally for college with minimum wage jobs (with enough left over for rent and food) and then buy a house for less than 90% of their annual income and watch it increase in value ten-fold over the next 20 years!
see, here's the thing: they did work hard.
they can be proud of what they did.
but what they *can't* do is assume that the same amount of work will yield the same results now, that the same level job leads to the same lifestyle, or the same dedication to work produces equal career advancement, then as now.
discussions about the idea of privilege usually come back to "i worked hard for this -- how dare you suggest i'm only successful because i'm white/male/whatever."
and it's true, you probably did work hard.
the point isn't to say you didn't -- it's to acknowledge that lots of other people also worked their asses off, as much as you did or maybe twice as much, and didn't reach success, because you worked hard *and* had connections through your parents, or could afford to spend a year on an unpaid internship, or were unfairly seen as more trustworthy than coworkers just because you were white in a black-majority high-crime area.
it doesn't mean you should get no credit -- it means you shouldn't assume that anyone who *didn't* get that high-paying job didn't work hard, or that you were all competing on a level playing field.
so, no, i don't think all inheritors (i like it) are lazy.
but i do think they came along at an ideal time to be able to afford their lifestyles pretty easily, and that's nothing to hold against them, but it does make it infuriating when they blame our troubles on us by ignoring how much different the job market, career field, and economic realities are now.
so 8 times in the first 74 years of the award, and 7 times in the past 16 years.
they should just rename it "story of the year" at this point.
i mean... they're all "stories" of the year.
one can't be named person of the year without having a story behind why that person is chosen... that's his point.
the award is always a story, but not always a person, hence story of the year is more accurate.
i mean, its also a reflection of society itself has changed.
because of how much more connected everyone is and how easy communication has begun, a lot of the bigger achievements are no longer the responsibility of individuals.
in the past, people would act as symbolism for movements.
like a focal point that could be the mouthpiece for everyone.
you can listen to one person than individually having to call a million to hear what their frustrations are or organize marches and actions.
now, everyone can almost have an equal voice and movements are driven by populations.
while there were individuals that provided the spark, the arab springs were largely influenced by twitter so much so, that beyond that spark, their influence waned.
it became about people.
&gt; a lot of the bigger achievements are no longer the responsibility of individuals.
for this reason, a lot of people want to expand the nobel prize to be open to teams rather than just individuals (it currently has a limit of being split between a maximum of 3 people) the cover is adama iwu (activist), ashley judd (actress and the main person to come forward about weinstein for the nyt article), taylor swift (musician), isabel pascual (strawberry picker), and susan fowler (former uber engineer).
edit: &gt;a young hospital worker who had flown in from texas completed the circle.
she too is a victim of sexual harassment but was there anonymously, she said, as an act of solidarity to represent all those who could not speak out.
that’s the elbow on the right of the cover.
i wasn't aware that ashley judd was among the harassment accusers.
she actually first mentioned it publicly in october 2015. just don't mention her on the_donald.
take it a step further and just don't mention anything in td.
also don't read anything.
yesterday i called out a user in there who referred to a group of somali children as "roaches" that should get "run over".
brought up how liberals will keep calling trump supporters racist as long as trump does/says nothing to deter racists like that from joining his ranks.
got immediately banned for trolling, and my comment ended up with 10x more downvotes than the one saying foreign kids should get run over.
welcome to the proud ranks of r/bannedfromthe_donald/ sometimes i go on the_donald after something big happens in the news just to see how they spin it to their favor and laugh at their delusion.
i sometimes do that too, but the humour usually leaves me very fast.
it was funny the first 5 or 6 times, now it’s like staring into some post-apocalyptic wonderland.
i could never see the humor.
it is scary how people can process information that way.
“hahaha, they just blamed a mass shooting on muslims when it was really a deranged white guy and over 59 people are dead and even more are injured and holy shit the world is a scary place and these insane morons vote.” and it got so much worse once the initial reports came out it wasn't a muslim but a white guy.
before the shooters name was made public t_d went and blamed some random old guy on the word of /pol/.
they then proceeded to post and link to shots of this guys social media including his full name, pictures of him and the pictures and names of his grandchildren!
fucking children!
it was sick.
"radical islamic turrrururur" *shooter is white* "radical antifa false flag soros turrrururururururst" i only go there when something hits r/all.
there was a post about how child prostitution is legal in california now and they're all lol wtf cali liberal shithole.
when in reality its to keep underage people who are trafficked from being criminals.
it's still illegal to hire a prostitute of any age, just not to be one that is underage.
the elbow on the cover symbolizes those women who have made accusations but won’t provide their identities.
today, we are all elbows.
in all seriousness though, good job time.
we are anonymous today but hoping we won't have to be in the future.
that makes more sense.
i thought they just mike wazowski'd some poor woman.
don't forget the hospital worker who is just out of frame who even now fears going public will ruin her career/life.
how is rose mcgowan not on the cover?
her twitter rants seemed to get the ball rolling on this whole movement.
i'm going to say it was ke$ha who got the ball rolling.
it rolled backwards on top of her, but it did start rolling.
or courtney love... who said shit about weinstein in 2001 and got blacklisted because of it.
her twitter rant was post-nyt article which was judd she was talking about this years ago and nobody believed her.
she's in the article.
they have judd on the cover representing that area (entertainment) and she was vocal about this earlier as well.
she was also the most prominent to go on the record for the nyt story.
the article was pretty wide including mcgowan, alyssa milano as well as terry crews.
my favorite quotes from taylor swift's testimony: * swift was asked by mr mueller’s lawyers if he had groped her more than once.
“other than grabbing my ass against my will, underneath my skirt, and refusing to let go, he did not otherwise touch me inappropriately.” * “i am not going to allow your client to make me feel like it is in any way my fault because it isn’t.” * “i’m being blamed for the unfortunate events of his life that are a product of his decisions.
not mine."
when gabriel mcfarland, david mueller's attorney, tried to take more shots at her... * “gabe, this is a photo of him with his hand up my skirt — with his hand on my ass,” she said.
“you can ask me a million questions — i’m never going to say anything different.
i never have said anything different.” * when mcfarland asked the singer why the front of her skirt did not appear to be lifted in the phone, she said, “because my ass is located in the back of my body.” * mcfarland also noted that swift was closer to mueller’s girlfriend, shannon melcher, who also appears in the photo, than him.
“yes, she did not have her hand on my ass,” swift replied.
and when asked if she criticized her bodyguards for not stepping in sooner... * [swift] told mr mueller's lawyer she was “critical of [his] client sticking his hand under my skirt and grabbing my a**."
*[for those of you who are unaware, a dj sued swift for "ruining his career" after she complained about the groping.
in response, she counter-sued him for assault and battery, demanding damages of $1 to make her point.

edit #2; thanks, and i'm glad y'all enjoyed the comment!
i pledge to pay it forward this week, since all humorous swift quotes aside, harassment of any kind is a serious issue and takes a communal effort to tackle.
if you feel moved to throw in some dollars as well, every little bit counts.
find out where your local organizations are.
see what's out there.
check out [rainn's website](https://rainn.org/) for support lines and suggestions on how to get involved.
sexual violence isn't always "just" a skeezy grope by a frosted tip dj.
and finally, remember that children are perhaps the most vulnerable in all of this.
child and adolescent boys and girls make up a huge portion of abuse victims.
[the website](https://rainn.org/safety-parents) above has some good talking points if you need help starting the conversation.
tell your daughters that their body is their own, and tell your sons that they can be victims too (and that speaking up doesn't make less manly.)
edit #3; [source](http://variety.com/2017/biz/news/taylor-swift-accuses-dj-of-grabbing-my-ass-in-court-testimony-1202522506/) for additional quotes love this quote.
“i’m told it was the most amount of times the word “ass” has ever been said in colorado federal court.” i love this.
i hate the usual phrasing that makes things sound more innocent than they actually are.
i'm happy she used normal language to describe it.
yeah, the combination of the deliberate effort to avoid any euphemisms and make sure it sounded vulgar every time, and refusing to ever let him pit any blame.on anyone else, is great.
reminds me of that [george carlin bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vueqixrbkcc) god i miss that old fuck.
and the counter suit of $1.
thats awesome.
being a resident of denver metro, i've heard a bit about this case.
glad she stood her ground so strong.
the music video for *look what you made me do* came out right after she won this case, and there's a short clip of her in a tub full of diamonds and jewels, [with a single dollar bill sitting right on top](https://i.imgur.com/tn3sxmd.jpg).
thought it was pretty funny.
that dj must have gotten so pissed every time he turned the radio on and her voice blasted "look what you made me do."
to him every day.
say what you want about the song itself, that video is just filled to the brim with easter eggs like that, and i find that quite amusing.
if you take the song as tongue-in-cheek rather than dead serious it's actually really fun, imo eh, she said blank space was tongue in cheek, i think this one is a little more serious.
the video pitch was "imagine if every ridiculous thing printed about me was true" but the song kinda gets to the point of her frustration with the fickle media/public opinion of her.
i suppose i meant more 'intentionally over the top," because yeah it's definitely a serious sentiment.
she really does catch a lot of heat, much of it unwarranted, but i also don't think she is gonna put out a hit on anyone.
probably.
i was pretty meh about the song until the video.
the video is a masterpiece and imo completely saved the song.
i was shocked that it was not nominated for the "best music video" grammy this year never caught onto that but it's fucking beautiful.
she reveals in the article that he still hasn't paid the dollar yet.
aaaand he hasn’t even given her that $1.
send him to collections!
i'm not a fan of hers, but that is brilliant.
oh shit i totally forgot about that with all the other scandals happening.
i was wondering why she was on the list.
&gt;* swift was asked by mr mueller’s lawyers if he had groped her more than once.
“other than grabbing my ass against my will, underneath my skirt, and refusing to let go, he did not otherwise touch me inappropriately.” for a second there i thought the russia investigation had taken another unexpected turn... she also said the courtroom gasped when it was announced she was the one being sued.
like...even the courtroom couldn't believe her assaulter sued her for speaking up.
my favorite was (when asked why a witness standing in front of her claimed not to have seen the groping), “because my ass is located in the back of my body.” i don't pay attention to swift at all so i never heard about all this, though i do remember hearing something about her winning a court case for a dollar.
that was pretty funny, though now knowing what it was tied to, good for her.
this is the first time i've really liked taylor swift.
i don't know how you feel about ke$ha but [swift paid for her legal defense.
](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/taylor-swift-donates-250-000-to-kesha-after-court-ruling-20160222) made me respect her.
kesha is lit right now after hearing praying on the radio i went and listened to her other new stuff.
i've always thought she had a great voice but was never a fan of her style.
this stuff, though, this stuff i like.
bob mueller sure gets around.
the dj's name is david mueller his name is robert paulson.
don’t worry bro, i understood your post was a joke.
*high fives* it made me laugh but i was legit wondering why robert mueller was questioning taylor swift.
possible taylor swift-russia collision?
tswift and putin 😍😍😍 can't wait for that breakup song called hot like polonium [swift is due to testify next week in a civil case she brought against a former local dj who is accused of grabbing her butt during a meet-and-greet four years ago.
swift says she’s “never been so sure of anything in her life” that david mueller intentionally put his hand under her skirt and touched her.
mueller claims he never meant to touch swift inappropriately when they had their photo taken together at denver’s pepsi center on june 2, 2013.]
(https://amp.thedailybeast.com/taylor-swift-finally-faces-down-the-man-she-says-groped-her) i can never find any reason to dislike taylor swift.
every now and then people say stuff like "she plays like she's a small town girl who made it big, but she comes from money", but that's called playing a character - it's literally what the industry is.
every non-career thing i've ever seen her say or do has been... pretty remarkably centered.
she must be very humble and level headed to have *that* career and just be a great example for *people* everywhere.
i’m not a fan of how she deals with drama but i still really respect what she did here i still can't believe how many stories came out in a month's time.
it changed culture forever.
good on all victims for having the courage to speak out.
they deserve this honor.
&gt;forever this is an immortal beast that has been beaten back to its cave.
best case scenario, it'll return after everyone alive today is dead.
most likely, it'll come back sooner.
there will always be naive, scare, young people who really want to be actors/models/journalists/whatever, and there will always be people rich enough to sweep things under the rug.
i worry all this will do is make the darkness meaner and darker.
i don't think people have a real grasp of how much power this beast control.
much like how we don't understand how much the 1% is?
similar.
specifically what worries me is when a few people go down then people will think the beast is vanquished and will develop a false sense of security.
you're not wrong, but i think what you describe is the necessary step we have to take.
for a start, i don't think it'll make workplace discrimination or sexual discrimination worse, but the actions and stories we hear will get worse.
that's because once you scrape away the horrible outer layer, you get to the rotten core.
i guarantee the next thing will be the sex slave and pornography rings, the epsteins and the savilles of hollywood.
secondly, we might push it further underground, but our choice is between taking action, and having to *chase it* when it does dig further, or taking no action.
and thirdly there's no end.
we'll eliminate sexual harassment, and then it'll be racism.
then who knows - maybe we can stop judging people for their personal tastes.
but this is life, and improvement, and design - this is social evolution, the march of change.
its always ugly and difficult, but the choice is between doing nothing and going nowhere or fighting to make sure the next generation don't have to put up with the shit you did.
&gt; i guarantee the next thing will be the sex slave and pornography rings, the epsteins and the savilles of hollywood.
i'm not so sre, i was hoping that would have already happened with spacey molesting a minor, and the whole corey feldman, lindsay lohan coming out and talking about being molested as children and elijah wood talking about sex rings too, but it was swept under the rug and everyone focused on the adults.
i think after a certain point people just don't want to hear about it because it's too terrible to contemplate.
if someone comes up to you and starts talking about child sex rings, people's natural instinct is to shrug it off, they don't want to live in a world where that sort of thing happens so they choose not to by ignoring it.
edit: factual accuracy about elijah wood elijah wood has stated that the predators were real, but he himself was never a victim not to be picky, and i agree with all you said, but we need to dispel this idea that this happens to "naive, scared, young people" or any other idea that tries to put victims in a specific pattern, specially because it makes precedent for victim blaming.
this can and did happen to all kinds of different people, regardless of age, race, sex, class or behaviour.
&gt;naive scared young people &gt;terry crews yeah i'm with you on this one.
na it's not done.
it may be less with famous people because they saw how it can get out and destroy them but sexual assault for the "commoners" won't go away.
college, buisness, bar scene, etc will continue to have the same issues (not saying it's everywhere all the time but it's not going to decrease from the current rates) cause sadly if it's not someone everyone knows doing the assaulting it's not going to make news and those women aren't going to feel the support of the whole world backing them up.
people who feel they have power over women are still going to try and take advantage of them.
at best they go in hiding for a couple years wish it changed our politics forever.
seems politicians are immune.
i opened two tabs from r/news at the same time, and thought that this was a comment on "pfizer denies fumes from factory that produces viagra are arousing town's males."
i'm glad to see that i was wrong.
they certainly have changed our country and defined a good portion of 2017 in the usa.
good pick time.
not even just the usa, it's spread around the world.
a lot of stuff has come out about people here in australia for instance.
i was recently in an african country (being vague on purpose) and it was certainly a topic of convo among my friends who live there.
and it was clear that it came up at their work as well, though i don't know at what level of formality.
all positive developments in any event.
all change starts with awareness.
&gt;white_genocidist .. &gt;i was recently in an african country (being vague on purpose) um...should...we call someone?
it’s almost as if people everywhere have a deep seated desire for fairness and justice.
maybe there is still hope for the lot of us.
hope is the thing with feathers – that perches in the soul – and sings the tune without the words – and never stops – at all hey emily!
i used to say that poem to myself when i was young and being abused.
it helped me through some difficult times.
i'm not a huge fan of the "group" time person of the year, but this year they definitely picked the right non-individual time's person of the year is... you, again!
in one of carlos castaneda's curious books, his sorcerer/shaman teach don juan has him dress up like a woman for a trip through part of mexico.
they go hitch hiking and after they're picked up, castaneda starts attracting the men in the group since they believe him to be a woman.
normally men are not on the receiving end of this attention where man's primal appetite is sniffing around and driving their behavior.
with the carnal desires raw and imbalanced enough to forsake nuanced, reciprocal openings up into subtler communication and deeper connection with the woman, it spills out over onto a "casual" predatory behavior, the standard illusions/masks of civilization and control over natural impulses is gone.
after some uncomfortable, threatening time around all these men gawking at him, making small unwanted sexually charged comments, and even touching him, he and don juan get dropped off on the side of the road.
here, don juan has castaneda take the women's clothes off.
castaneda asks what the hell that was about and don juan responds by saying he was teaching him what it was like to be a woman.
a man's biggest persistent fear is that he will be humiliated, a woman's biggest persistent fear is that she will be raped.
really inspired to see a culture shift taking place around the treatment of women.
like most sensitization and growth, it is not a comfortable process, and women have generations and generations of suppressed tension--a lot of sadness, grief, anger, rage, resentment, so it will not be a short process either.
but it's necessary for our survival, our thriving, and the richness, in every sense of the word, of our society and culture.
if you can't say 'no' then your 'yes' is meaningless, and by supporting courageous women (and men) who have come forward to share their stories we are empowering women everywhere to have a stronger sense of power, dignity, and individual sovereignty and boundaries.
powerful times.
for an unimpressed asshole, that was nice i can't think of a better pick for this year either.
the more stories of people coming forward, the more strength it will give to those who have been hurt in the past.
tldr: - the 'silence breakers' who started the #metoo movement have been named time 'person of the year'  - last year's winner, president trump, and china's president xi jinping came in second and third place  - time editor-in-chief edward felsenthal called the movement 'the fastest moving social change we've seen in decades'  - the announcement was made wednesday morning on the today show, exactly a week after co-host matt lauer was fired for sexual harassment allegations   4th was special counsel mueller.
5th was kim jong-un.
in case anybody else was interested who filled out the top 5.
6th was sean astin for playing bob in stranger things.
bob was too good for this world *was*?
awh, what the hell, man.
😔 mueller's got to be a favorite going into 2018, depending on how this investigation turns out.
&gt; last year's winner it's not an award to be "won".
it's being "named" person of the year.
it's considered the person who has had the most influence for better or ***worse***.
yeah, people tend to forget that hitler, stalin and komeini were named person of the year because they had a huge impact (a negative one but still huge).
also in 2001 bin laden was a very likely candidate.
it's not an award, not an honor, you don't win anything.
it means you were important that year, not that you were a model or a force for good.
the fact that bin laden didn't get it for 2001 shows how many people don't understand it's not always for the best it could also be for the worst.
pretty sure time wanted to name him but didn't want to deal with the bullshit backlash.
this is bound to influence in more people be comfortable to speak out, so this is a wise decision.
i hope you're right, but i actually had the opposite feeling.
like this was the big finale and we're supposed to focus on something else now in 2018. perhaps it's because we traditionally honor people at the end of things, such as school years, sports seasons, retirement, etc.
maybe.
the article suggests this could be just the start, and i hope they're right.
&gt;we are in the middle of the beginning of this upheaval.
there is so much that we still don’t know about its ultimate impact.
how far-reaching will it be?
how deep into the country?
how far down the organizational chart?
will there be a backlash?
this also makes terry crews a times person of the year.
he is included in the photos within the article.
about 3/4 of the way through.
at least he is on desktop, not sure how it looks on mobile.
yes he is in the cover story.
/r/crewscrew would be proud :,) they never stopped being proud can we get terry to be a mod of /r/wholesomememes ?
he's one of the most wholesome celebrities i know.
he's also in the video time produced.
just finished watching the video.
i encourage others to watch it, as well.
it was very well done, it gave multiple points of view, reasons why this was a slam dunk pick for time, and packed a lot of information in the 5 minutes that it was shown.
yep.
he's there.
well its not really shocking that so many sexual predators and sexual harassment happens in hollywood when you take into consideration the rest of the us for both men and women.
* **1 out of 4** women &amp; **1 out of 10** men experience one or more incidents of sexual harassment in the workforce in the us.
* **2 out of 3** women experience one or more incidents of sexual harassment on the street in the us.
* **1 out of 4** women &amp; **1 out of 16** men experience one or more incidents of sexual assault in the us.
* **1 out of 6** women &amp; **1 out of 33** men experience attempted or completed rape in their lifetime in the us.
* out of the 25% of women and 6,3% of men who experience sexual assault **only 20-30% of them report the assault** to the authorities.
* out of the cases of sexual assault that are reported to the police, only **,on average, 20% are arrested**, while **only around 5% are prosecuted** and **only on average 3% are incarcerated.
** so this isn't a hollywood centric issue.
its a world-wide issue in regards to sexual boundaries, respect, victim-shaming and simple concept of consent and ethics.
luckily the amount of rapes in the us has dropped since 1980s by 60%, but the amount of rapes still happening are too high for any society that wants to move forward to a better future.
and this recent examination of the sexual abuse in hollywood will be a great catalyst towards that future, as per usual a society in which we idolize celebrities, only by humanizing them and seeing them acknowledge the problem, and work to change to fix that problem, will push the society be more open to even accepting that there is a problem that needs to be discussed in the first place.

there was a huge movement in scandinavia where women in the music industry, like normal people many non-famous, shared their stories about how people around them would sexually assault, harass or at times coerce them into positions they did not want to be in.
there were about 1000 different women who came forward with stories of such incidents.
here are some of them that i translated so people can be aware that these things they dont just happen in far away places, they happen all around us.
**01 of 20** &gt; when i attended music education, we had a small party at school.
we were 20 people together and several of our teachers were present.
all married men with children.
&gt;on the dance floor, one of them suddenly grabs my hips, turns me around, bends me forward and pretends he penetrates me hard from behind.
to the full applause from the other male colleagues, teachers, and in front of all my new friends.
&gt;it was so incredibly embarrassing and disgusting!
i said nothing and nobody else said anything.
**02 of 20** &gt; comment from the 10 years old experienced guys on tour to me about my roommate: "dont you want to fuck?!
you are the only ones in the orchestra we have not fucked yet. "
**03 of 20** &gt;i was a music student and was invited with some other girls to a casting abroad.
an influential manager well over the years was holding auditions for a new girl group.
the auditions were obviously to be kept at the manager's home, and only he was present.
&gt;he gave us lots of wine and asked us to act flirting so that he could assess if we had "what it takes".
he showed us videos of several other girl groups he had worked with, and bragged that he had been with them all.
we laughed it off awkwardly and we felt secure as we were a group.
&gt;the next day, for several reasons, i found myself alone with him in his home.
he said i was most ready for the group and wanted to see me acting for the part, alone.
"come towards me and be seductive," he said, and i tried to do what he said.
mostly because i felt i owe him since he paid for our entire trip.
&gt;when i walked towards him, he grabbed around my body tight.
i tried to say i had a boyfriend and would not do this and tried to wring myself away.
but suddenly he stabbed two fingers into me under my skirt, and then everything went completely black.
&gt;i tried to fight it while his cold, old tongue was in my mouth and many other places on my body.
my body shut down.
i felt i had no choice.
he opened his trousers and pushed my hand around his crotch.
only when he pushed my head down there i managed to get loose.
he laughed.
when i got home, he called me and said i had gotten the job.
i could come down for a photo shoot next weekend.
&gt;of course i did not go.
and i never told anyone.
it's only now, 15 years later, that i feel i can say that what happened was not my fault.
**04 of 20** &gt;i was 16-17 years old and new in town.
i had met a guy, maybe ten years older than me, who liked my music.
big tall guy.
he made sure to arrange a meeting between us so late that i could not go home since i did not live in the city.
he poured me a lot of wine.
&gt;i remember him playing loud music he knew i liked.
i remember the arm around me while grabbing the sofa and asked "do you find this uncomfortable?"
and then just kept holding even harder.
if im honest, much of what happened is blurry to me.
i remember being pushed to do a bunch of things i did not want, even though i said "no", "stop", "do not do it" and he held me down.
&gt;i did not have the chance.
i remember waiting until he fell asleep before i managed to sneak out at 03:30 in the morning, full of shame.
i felt filthy and had a mental and physical pain.
got a bunch of "dick pics" afterwards.
felt like vomiting every time i saw the snapchat icon, and he always wanted me to come back.
i still blame myself.
**05 of 20** &gt;i played at a festival, we were five girls in the early 20's.
&gt;a guy of approx.
40 who was a longtime crew member for a famous band did a series of inappropriate approaches.
he entered the backstage, took off his upper body and asked for massage.
we shook our head and laughed at first, and did not know if he was serious.
&gt;he hung around and finally asked if one of us could have sex with him for 5000 kr.
we told the band he worked for about this right afterwards, and they seemed "tired" and answered something like "ffs, not again, he's just a bit hopeless."
&gt;that stopped that thing.
**06 of 20** &gt;at the concert.
at the back in the corner of the venue.
full.
cramped with an audience.
good atmosphere.
&gt;industry colleague says, "can you hold my beer?"
&gt;and when i had a beer in each hand, he puts his hand in my crotch and gives me a look like saying, "what are you doing now?".
&gt;i was almost about to break both beer bottles on his face.
**07 of 20** &gt;my first encounter with the industry was when i played in a band with a bunch of elderly men who have been active musicians since i was born.
i was 23. one of them was constantly on me.
&gt;one of the others flirted with me also, but he probably used it most to position himself in relation to me.
flirting usually occurred in front of other people, for example, that he whistled on me when i had changed my dress.
it all peaked when we were behind the stage at a larger festival, and he lifted up my skirt and showed my ass to everyone who was there.
&gt;when i confronted him with it just after, he just said, "you should have to be able to handle that."
**08 of 20** &gt;i had just gotten to know a much older man in the music environment i'm a part of.
one night we had met outside and was on our way home, he invited me to his place.
i joined, we talked a little and went to bed since it was late.
i was not interested in anything, slept fully dressed and went home the following day.
okay.
&gt;a few days later we agreed to meet.
i came and he took me out to a restaurant, something i had not expected.
i was nevertheless flattered and thought it was just nice.
afterwards we went home to him and talked and played music.
he talked a lot about a musical project he wanted me to join, showed me the songs and wanted me to learn them.
&gt;occasionally he came with physical approaches, which i carefully rejected.
eventually he became very upset and fussy and began to "shame" me.
because i had already slept with him without sleeping with him.
because i said i liked him, but did not want to have sex with him.
he even used the fact that i had had some partners before, against me.
why should not i have sex with him then?
&gt;in the end, i felt so guilty, and in addition, i was greatly intoxicated that i gave up to his pressures and just lied down and let him do his thing.
there and then, i was just glad he finished fast.
**09 of 20** &gt;a couple of years ago i participated in a project.
i was in a group with a producer i admired, and two other men whom i knew and liked.
the time was approx.
11 in the day, and the producer already started to get quite drunk.
we started anyway.
&gt;a few hours later it became clear that it was not possible to continue and that the producer just focused on me alone in the room.
he became obsessed completely about my ass, and made comments about it all the time.
i started to get pretty angry, the others had also asked him to stop several times.
&gt;the episode culminated that he laid down on the floor like a three-year-old in a fit and shouted repeatedly: "i wanna fuck you in the ass."
just then more people came into the room, and my humiliation felt quite complete.
&gt;nobody did anything, they just walked out.
later i went to the management and said that i demanded that the person should be fired.
then i was told that he was too talented to let go and that he had some alcohol problems.
**10 of 20** &gt;after finishing work at an industry festival, i stood at the bar in the main tent waiting to order myself a beer.
a festival colleague from another festival comes up behind me, "locks" me in by putting my arms on each side of me and thrusting at me three to four times hard against the bar counter before im able to push him away.
&gt;he breaks out: "oh, you just do something to me."
**11 of 20** &gt;my worst incident was when i, as a young new orchestra musician, went out for a concert.
&gt;because it was late, i got an offer to sleep with an older colleague who lives nearby.
"no, you can sleep on the couch, so you do not have to spend money on a taxi home!"
he said.
&gt;when we enter the door of his place, he changed his behavior.
wanted to kiss me and started touching me.
i wasnt sober, but i did definitely say no and walked away from him.
he didnt stop, started nagging, i moved away again, he moved towards me again.
i didnt want to get mad and create a bad mood, since i felt he has the power over my future career.
i said i'm tired and ask if i can sleep.
&gt;there was of course no couch as he offered, just a double bed.
i emphasized that i just wanted to sleep, turn away, say "no, i do not want to," but he continues nagging, continues to touch me.
in the end, i just let him do what he wanted, avoiding eye contact and felt that this was my fault that i was stupid enough to get drunk and unable to get out of the situation.
&gt;the next morning i tried to get out as soon as possible, but he insisted on chatting.
i explain that what happened the day before was not something i wanted.
that it felt bad and that i felt i clearly said no to his advances, but that he did not stop.
he starts trying to persuade me that "we were having a nice time" and start touching me up again.
continued below.
that was horrible to read.
fuck this is all so depressing.
continued from above.
**12 of 20** &gt; like many others, i've almost played exclusively with men whom i looked at as my closest friends and i feel safe with.
one thing that i have struggled with, however, is the assumption that my male bandmates "own me" and that i am safe in performances and on tour just because i'm always surrounded by a crew with men.
&gt;on several occasions, since we were very young, my male colleagues have been asked, "who is having sex with me,".
as if i belong to one of my male colleagues.
after our first festival job, one of my bandmates was warned by someone that he had to tell me to watch out because "his friend had a big desire to fuck me" words i have not forgotten since.
**13 of 20** &gt; i had said loud and clear about what i mean about a matter in a joint meeting at a festival i was working with.
festive co-worker then comes up behind me and whispers me in my ear: "i get so hard when you're strict."
i say nothing.
**14 of 20** &gt;in oslo, i was subjected to an assault by someone i had a thing with.
i have the same idea as others that this is something everyone has been through before, it is not worth doing anything about.
&gt;i remember going home with my panties in the bag, the one he teared when he ripped it off me while holding me down and i thought it was not worth it to fight it.
that the music environment he was in, his crew, was going to make trouble for me.
i wouldn't get any more gigs.
so i did nothing.
&gt;a year later he contacted me.
i rejected talking to him on a message.
he called.
we had a long conversation.
and he apologized very much.
**15 of 20** &gt; i was in my 20's and was working as a district musician right after my studies.
i stayed in a place by myself and one evening someone knocked on the door.
one of the older musicians came to visit.
it was a little weird, but also nice since i did not know so many people there.
&gt;i remember that i was walking barefoot and that the ragsocks hung on the radiator in the living room because i had been outside in the snow.
suddenly he comes to me, clinging to me and saying that i should not be afraid.
but that he likes small tits.
&gt; he rubs up on me.
i'm saying stop, but he answers that i was the one who wanted it.
i finally get loose and says he has to go, he reluctantly goes to the door and i get him out and lock the door.
i cant call anyone.
&gt;later, after a big band practice, he followed me in a car, saying, i was tempting him since i was barefoot.
that i was walking across the line.
**16 of 20** &gt; i had responded to an advertisement for a production where they had asked for pictures.
a few weeks later, i received a private mail from one of the producers who wrote that he was new and needed human contact.
&gt;he could offer me 3000 kr per time we met, and could guarantee that it would be quickly over.
**17 of 20** &gt; i was 17 years old and had contact with someone who could take promo shots for my first solo concert.
he was a hobby photographer, but i had seen some of his work and liked his work.
he said he could take the pictures for free.
he had a studio at his house, and after first meeting at the cafe and planning the photography, i went there.
&gt;we started the photography as planned.
he constantly commented on my body, and thought the photos could became better, "more wounded and more intimate", if i bare my shoulders.
i took off my sweater and pulled my dress strap down my shoulders.
"bare back," he said, and wanted that i take off of the clothes from my upper body.
&gt;i stood there in tights and felt that this did not represent my music, but still thought he knew best.
eventually he took the memory card from the camera and put it on the pc and asked me to come and sit.
he pulled me closer to him and let his hand lie around my midriff.
he flips through the pictures and says "look so nice you are", pointing to his pants and an obviously erect penis.
&gt;i didnt dare to move, and the hand he has around my midriff glides under my skirt and my tights.
he continues to scroll through the pictures with a hand in my underwear.
with a little miracle, my phone rings that is in my bag a little bit away, and i finally get the chance to save myself out from his grip.
i lied and said it's mom asking me to come home right away.
&gt;all the way home, i cried.
i was 17. and i was left with the feeling that i should have known better.
**18 of 20** &gt;lost a job on a choir for a album because i would not "kneel down and work for it".
the producer demanded that i should suck him off!
when i became angry and said i would rather wash the toilets at the train station with my tongue than doing it, he said he would destroy my name in the industry.
i stormed out and cried in the car afterwards.
**19 of 20** &gt;this week it's been two years since my life's worst night.
&gt;i celebrated my birthday out and accidentally met more friends.
among them a acquaintance for many years, who worked in the music industry.
it was a good mood, we ended up with a group and later went home with him.
i wanted to come home with him and wanted to have sex with him.
&gt;however, quite soon as we entered his place he changed completely and became angry and violent.
the more i resisted, the more aggressive he became.
in the end i gave up, turned off my mind and let the body go limp.
when i went home the day after, i was full of bruises and scrubmarks.
&gt;i felt a lot of guilt, i did want to go home with him.
i doubted my own judgment.
it was not possible for me to report it to the police, but i thankfully changed my mind after six months.
later it turned out that he was previously convicted of violence.
nevertheless, the police used more than a year to question him.
i'm still waiting for the case to be taken or to know if the case is being rejected.
**20 of 20** &gt; i was invited home to the boss after a production.
i was pleased and full of good experiences.
&gt;when the taxi stopped at his place, i wondered why it was just him and me there, that was not the deal.
but i joined.
inside the house, he jumps on me before i can do anything.
my reaction was, of course, to resist everything i could while my heart was all the way up my throat and my hands and legs trembling.
&gt;he did not care and tried to tear off my clothes while he also had a grip on my hair that i felt like was going to tear out with the scalp.
&gt;i do not know what happened to me other than that fear went over to a terrible anger that ended up with me getting some punches in that almost knocked him out.
the last thing i saw was that he lay on the floor between the coffee table and the sofa completely knocked out.
i'm grabbed my things and ran out.
then came the reaction: i began to tremble.
when i got home i saw that i had marks and wounds all over my body, neck and head.
&gt;after this, i did not get any more jobs from him or his colleagues.
so i just wanted to post these to kind of bring attention to what everyday people go through some times.
these arent celebs or public people, these are just normal people that have such experiences once or more in their lives.
there were about 1000 more stories like these posted but these were the ones publicized in a news article .
[source here:](https://www.aftenposten.no/kultur/i/qnp89z/narmusikkenstilner-plutselig-stakk-han-to-fingre-inn-i-meg-under-skjortet-mitt) sexual harassment and sexual assault is something that needs to be acknowledged and discussed, its been with us with our cultures around the world since the beginning, and the only way to move forward to a better place is to acknowledge it and talk about it more than just when some brown people or immigrants are involved.
there was a story i saw on twitter about a woman who was visited in the hospital by police who harrassed her for reporting a policeman that raped her.
and people wonder why women don't report rape.
i reported my rape to a *female* police officer, within 12 hours of it happening, with physical evidence (bruising and bleeding), and text messages from the guy admitting that he knew i didn’t consent.
she implied that it was my fault and told me there was nothing the police could do.
i’d never felt so ashamed and broken and helpless in my life.
i saw an attorney about a civil suit, but didn’t have the mental strength to go through a trial.
instead i went through two years of therapy, nightmares, panic attacks, parental rejection, losing my best friend, my work suffering, etc.
the turning point was getting a dog who i’m pretty sure would lay down her life for me.
she sleeps next to me every night and will wake me up if i start to get agitated in my sleep, will press her body against me and nudge my hand at the onset of a panic attack (often before i even realize one is starting), and is protective of me when strange men approach us in public (not biting, but will give a little warning growl).
i’m no longer afraid and feel like my old self.
i still occasionally think about that female police officer, and how terribly broken our justice system is.
i feel for all the people out there who have experienced the same hurt and not received justice.
yeah people are always like why do these people not speak up earlier?
without realizing the only people you can talk to are the police who regularly kill black dudes for no reason.
it's a fucking terrible system.
i'm so sorry you went through that.
the lack of support people receive from our law enforcement and our peers is heartbreaking.
it doesn't matter if somebody walks down the street naked, nobody gets to touch them without their consent.
he talked about how all the women coming out helped him come to terms and speak out.
glad they got him into the article.
the whole metoo has been powerful for a lot of people.
he publicly identifies as a feminist.
i wonder how many of the menn on here identify as feminists.
i do.
if you're for equal treatment of women then you are a feminist.
it's a tragedy that people can fall into a trap that feminism somehow means women ruling over men like a tribe of amazonian women.
for simply talking about equality i grew up bring called a femnazi by a male relative.
he still uses that term to this day.
oh, you weren’t aware that seeking equality for women was fundamentally the same thing as murdering 10 million people in cold blood?
me too.
i came to the conclusion that the definition and reality of feminism is vastly different in reddit and in real life.
which is why he's featured in the article.
he's in the article, he posed for a photo hundreds of thousands of women, and the top comment is about one of the few men... "the silence breakers" sounds like an edm group.
or a game of thrones sellsword company.
or professional torturers.
my first reaction was "i haven't heard their album yet".
justice rains from above.
*justice rains fro-aaaaaaaghhhhh the most accurate version of the quote overwatch saved us with their vision of a more equal future, and that future is being realized as we speak.
now all we have to do is prevent the robot genocide.
you're powered up, get in there!
kind of sucks for all those people that broke the silence for decades and were shunned, ridiculed and even attacked.
that's exactly why this movement is important .
because it helps change that response.
it's almost as if there's a large portion of the population that's been actively trying to silence those women, and - maybe in the last year or so?
- they somehow lost all credibility with the rest of us.
better late than never on this one.
“what had manifested as shame exploded into outrage.
fear became fury.” let's sort by controversial... dont do it.
i barely got out alive.
might want to do a quick check for cancer.
this puts donald trumps tweet about saying no to times's person of the year into an especially cringey light.
unfortunately i'm numb to anything he does anymore now i understand why he thought he would be named again this year.
time probably called him for a comment because they were doing person of the year focusing on all the sexual harassment stories.
he thought he was a sure thing.
today he probably saw the cover and thought “ohhhh, they meant the *victims*.” this is perfect.
i'm picturing him in his desk right now just fuming.
"hey but i'm the one doing things, they just had to have it done to them.
i'm the real doer here.
should be my face!"
i'm a dude.
i gotta admit, the metoo thing really shook me up.
i was half on the notallmen bandwagon.
i knew men could act like complete slime to women but it couldn't be that widespread, right?
i was thinking from my own pov.
i'm not a woman.
once i saw all of the testimonies of my freinds on facebook and other media about how they've been harassed at some point in their lives, it crashed home to me that i was pretty insulated and the problem is widespread.
so, it isn't every last man, but it is far too many.
what women and all those willing to speak up against abuse have done this year is shedding light on the problems that still exist in our society.
yes, we don't want to look at it.
yes, we'll try to rationalize it away.
yes, it will take a very long time to fix this.
the conversation has started and it's time to start listening and considering viewpoints outside your own.
this is a very worthy person of the year cover.
the fact that we as men could be so unaware of the extent of the problem is a problem in itself.
it speaks to a larger issue of discounting victims, especially when they're of a different race or gender.
but it's never too late to become more empathetic and more trusting of the idea that other people have experiences that we can't fully understand since they differ so dramatically from our own.
i think it also speaks to how much things that are **totally normal** for some are a **complete surprise** to others.
we don't actually have common realities, even in the same place.
absolutely correct.
i've always discounted these stories subconsciously... the scope of this is incredibly enlightening.
it's crazy that something that would never even cross the mind of an average man is so prevalent.
to me, it's because it doesn't happen to men anywhere near as much.
hard to feel the reality of something that is happening to others when it isn't happening to yourself.
it's good to hear the stories of others.
there'd be know way of knowing otherwise.
reddit usually has an incredibly negative gut reaction to the term "privilege," but this is exactly what it is talking about.
your place in life can insulate you entirely from many issues and that doesn't mean that they aren't real issues.
a girl i knew over skype in 10th grade was raped by one of her friends.
she called me absolutely bawling, and wouldn't stop crying for weeks.
after she was done crying, she was a shell of her former self.
i couldn't talk to her anymore ( i had problems with depression in 10th grade, hormones were not kind to my brain) she was making me want to kill myself.
i don't have to a point to sharing this, just like her being raped didn't have a point.
she never got any meaningful answer as to "why" beyond he thought she was attractive and he decided to ruin their friendship and her life.
on a related note, i was "raped" (coerced) by a former girlfriend in high school.
i had asked for her help on a class project, and after we were finished she said she would tell the teacher if we didn't do it.
at the time it felt a bit slimy cause i really didn't want to, but i am alright now without any trust issues.
i don't know why i am sharing, i feel compelled to by your comment.
thanks for sharing.
we carry these traumas with us (our own and those of loved ones, which we consider our own in a sense) and the only resolution is to bring them to light.
that hits the nail on the head.
i have two older sisters, both of whom are objectively better than me in most ways.
financial stability, work ethic, ease of grasping in concepts, empathy, throwing a football— you name it.
both of them posted in the #metoo campaign and it blindsided me.
one was groped while working in a school; the other was pinned to a wall by a coworker and not allowed to leave until she kissed him.
the gut reaction— especially when it’s family— is to want to enact a violent revenge on those responsible.
i won’t pretend that isn’t still on my list of things i’d love to do to those pieces of slime.
but it isn’t going to solve the underlying problem— a system where men— *married* men in the case of my sisters— feel that it is at all acceptable to behave in such ways and to try to take what they want from another human being.
i am a woman and you two men just made me cry.
you listened.
you heard.
now, please, speak up when you see it happening.
call out people who engage in this behavior and take the next step in being part of the solution.
and please accept my heartfelt gratitude!
same here.
i really needed to see this today.
i can't count on the men in my life to get it so even coming across strangers who do has made me weep repeatedly.
honestly, it shocks me more that there were so many men who were unaware of the problem.
i am a woman, but i've grown up my whole life knowing about the problem even if nothing as terrible has happened to me.
i've learned about it in school several times.
i feel like the information has always been online.
why do you think you believe it now and not before?
or had you literally never heard of it before?
last week's snl sketch "welcome to hell" was a great (and morbidly funny) take on this.
i think as long as it wasn't personal for a lot of men, they could ignore it.
it's similar to the movement to get gay people to come out.
it's a lot harder to ignore something when it personally affects you.
making everyone realize they knew and loved at least one gay person did a lot for changing opinions on gay rights.
making every last man confront the fact that almost every woman they know was harassed/abused at some point really made the issue personal.
the girl i dated in college had been raped in high school.
she confided that in me, and it made the issue personal.
i don't think i knew or cared as much about it before i knew someone who had been so affected.
since then, i've been well aware of how women are treated on a daily basis.
but without that earlier experience, it's hard for me to say i would have felt the same.
basically, it's easy to ignore something that doesn't affect you.
it amazes me that we are so divided on these accusations.
every day i listen to someone at work saying that these people should've come forward sooner, that they just want a hand out, that they can't prove any of this so why does it matter.
if you haven't, watch "the keepers" on netflix.
it's an interesting look into the victims of sexual assault who "we're old enough to know better," and "should've said something sooner."
i know there are people who will jump on the bandwagon for their own profit, but we can't dismiss all these accusations just because of a few.
what blows my mind is people don't seem to understand that when they yell "why didn't they come out sooner, they must just want a handout", they are the reason that victims don't come forward sooner.
when your first response is to question the motives of the person coming forward, and to question the timing, you're contributing to the culture that prevents victims from coming forward.
great choice, this is a watershed moment but i feel the actual cover itself is done poorly.
more people should have been included and specifically i feel rose mcgowan deserved a spot on the visible cover.
(i haven't seen the fold yet).
the cover is adama iwu, ashley judd, taylor swift, isabel pascual, and susan fowler.
they represent activism/politics, hollywood, the music industry, working class/manual labor, and stem.
judd was the main victim in the nyt article about weinstein which is probably why she’s there over mcgowan - who is the header of the online article.
it's only a matter of time until trump tweets that he's a silence breaker.
he's going to claim obama touched his boob.
good.
they've had a huge impact this year.
it's still not over but less and less people are being afraid to speak out.
they've been very brave and courageous.
especially in this cultural and political climate where someone who said the following could become president: &gt;i did try and fuck her.
she was married.
i moved on her like a bitch, but i couldn’t get there.
and she was married.
then all of a sudden i see her, she’s now got the big phony tits and everything.
she’s totally changed her look.
i’ve gotta use some tic tacs, just in case i start kissing her.
you know, i’m automatically attracted to beautiful — i just start kissing them.
it’s like a magnet.
just kiss.
i don’t even wait.
when you're a star, they let you do it.
you can do anything... grab 'em by the pussy.
you can do anything.
&gt; donald trump to billy bush in 2005; "transcript: donald trump's taped comments about women", the new york times (8 october 2016) well deserved.
also mad respect for terry crews why is support for crews on reddit so disproportionate to everyone else?
he’s highlighted in the article among many more victims not on the cover fyi.
because he's a male victim of this horror.
it's also why you don't see comments about how his abuser is innocent until proven guilty or how it's scary that terry can just ruin his life around.
exactly.
i think terry crews is a fantastic and brave person, i have nothing but respect for him and i'm so glad he shared his story and is being heard.
especially since he is black, physically strong, and doesn't fit the typical profile of a sexual assault victim, i think his voice is so important.
male victims are just as important as female victims and they aren't treated that way most of the time and that needs to stop.
that being said, the lack of "innocent until proven guilty" comments and comments about how it's a shame that someone's career was ruined because of a tweet were apparent to me as well.
but with the lack of respect male victims are often shown, i understand why male-majority reddit was glad to see a man coming forward getting media attention.
i don't really blame them but the attitude difference is noticeable for sure.
exactly, people can try to deny it.
yet, when the erin andrews and hulk hogan privacy invasion cases came out shortly after each other i remember most comments on reddit about erin said things like, "fuck her she didn't even look good naked anyway."
and, "that bitch just wants people to feel sorry for her, she's so desperate for attention."
however when it was hulk most comments said things like, "yeah, i hope hulk destroys them!"
and, "he didn't deserve to have his privacy invaded."
he's a dude.
that's why.
because he's posted on reddit several times in the past, is in some movies and tv shows a lot of people on reddit like, and does some videogames stuff.
so he hits reddit's demographics perfectly.
while true, the more serious answer is that there was growing contentment in some of hollywood elite that crews is a physically strong, straight, black man who can't be sexually assaulted.
apparently only women can be sexually harassed which is ungodly false.
anyone can be.
edit: here is a recent example with [wendy williams](https://youtu.be/pi0epry7tsc?t=3m54s) on how shitty she was with crews's response.
my apologies for those who have to see a wendy williams video.
i think it also highlights the fact that most of the assault was accomplished because of power in the industry rather than strength and physical imposition.
that's an important detail to keep in mind if you want to seek change.
crews fits the bill as there is no denying that industry power was the key in creating that type of culture absolutely because it shattered the image that a physically strong man is immune from sexual harassment.
caught many people off guard and i am glad it did.
crews and james van der beek took big gambles and won many people over (as well am many women who started this forest fire of change).
and anthony rapp for calling out spacey.
once again, an absolutely shitty headline, with no basis in fact.
media representation about developments in genetic research is generally some of the worst reporting out there.
at least this article seems to cover, quite clearly and simply, the observations made and importantly *what they mean*.
at least this headline wasn't something like "science discover's the **gay gene**" (just wait someone will report this like that) &gt;“even if a gene variant does show some correlation with sexual orientation, this does not mean that the gene is in any way responsible for being gay – it just means it has some association with a trait that is more likely to found in the relatively few people involved as subjects in the study.
&gt;“this could be better social awareness or being brave enough to acknowledge that they are in a minority.” article also says that the study is based on subjects self reporting that they are gay.
so the gene may not in anyway be linked to homosexuality; however those with the gene and thous who are homosexual may just have a higher confidence level to accept and/or report that they are gay.
&gt;“i can see no major implications of this work or how it could be useful in the future.
&gt;“the genetic effects are far too weak to be of any predictive or diagnostic value.
all biology – including the origins of sexuality – is interesting at some level, but i see no direct applications of such research.” &gt; “the genetic effects are far too weak to be of any predictive or diagnostic value.
all biology – including the origins of sexuality – is interesting at some level, but i see no direct applications of such research.” the middle-east and north africa "gay testers" disagree /s combined with this: https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/dec/04/us-military-agency-invests-100m-in-genetic-extinction-technologies things could get very ugly.
fun observation: slitrk6, the gene they talk about which control brain development to areas like the hypothalamus (which regulates sex drive and might influence the "gay gene") rearrange the words slitrk6 to form the word : klitrs 6, or clitoris sex.
those scientists with their clever naming lol.
also, is there really a gay gene?
is it all genetic?
i have always assumed it was a bit of both, nature plus nurture.
i think influences in childhood always have a big role in shaping your adult life.
lots of peoples sexual fetishes are cause of stuff they encountered growing up (like watching old movies giving someone a fetish for women with pantyhose).
i assume sexual preference is related to this as well.
sexual orientation is mainly genetic with your environment and experience altering your preferences.
unless you were already bi, it's difficult to imagine an environment that would make a straight person act gay or vice-versa unless the feel the need to hide themselves due to societal repurcussions but the false life doesn't override their actual sexual orientation.
so...one more thing we can blame on our parents?
at least one [gene linked to homosexual desire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayu2xz-mfgw) has been known since the mid-1980s; it's regarded as benign if not outright beneficial.
it was a pretty big discovery for a lot of teens back then.
it is good to read the article and the article link to another article.
otherwise you will think that "genes linked to homosexuality discovered by scientists", which is not at all the case.
always read before you sign up.
they might find more then they are expecting in those genes.
i'm no genealogist but i'm pretty sure there is way more we don't know about gene functions than that we do.
also, i am a human being and find every person i meet to be a fascinating combination of environmental, genetic, and cultural experiences.
i'm glad i have the male pattern baldness gene.
i can't imagine carrying the shame of all the hair styles i would have sported over the years.
these people ought to get more funding.
and sandwiches.
okay, but can you find the gene link to super successful people like bill gates?
just so i can line up the right wife to make a super baby so my retirement plan can be handled by my child.
thanks.
well, insure that they have good cognitive abilities.
i think this is a good way to explain.
genes are our foundation, environment is the house and yard, experience is everything else.
&gt; okay, but can you find the gene link to super successful people like bill gates?
what is the genetic basis for high-functioning sociopathy?
https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/21/apparently-psychopaths-make-good-ceos.html https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/15/silicon-valley-psychopath-ceo-sxsw-panel http://www.businessinsider.com/ceos-often-have-psychopathic-traits-2017-7 https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2011/06/14/why-some-psychopaths-make-great-ceos/#38ab4f97261a high-functioning psychopathy** hopefully they discover a way to screen it like downs.
annnnnd... yup, a trumptard poster.
guess it’s too late to screen for that.
i’d be interested in an investigation on reddit.
a news outlet gets a large amount of traffic if their story reaches the front page.
sensationalized headlines help push these stories to the top.
i'm sure reddit, as with all other major social media players, has major issues with bots that they are choosing to not reveal because it boosts their value as a company.
that said i think it's pretty clear twitter is the worst of all the platforms in that regard as far as we know, twitter is the worst because it’s in the limelight.
i fear reddit may be worse because it’s a more effective tool to spread misinformation.
yeah, i cant say about twitter vs reddit but this place has gotten very bad in that regard over the last year.
it's pretty blatant now and almost nobody realizes or cares it's really getting out of control.. i mean it used to be that people would mock the idea of bots but now it's just a commonly accepted fact.
i've even gone through peoples comment history and found out that their account exists solely for pushing some sort of agenda.
i mean for sure it's not always a bot but four years ago there weren't nearly as many accounts dedicated to derailing political discussions.
and in subs such as /r/politics if you call someone a bot or troll you'll get banned.
because its as a worthless statement.
you are almost certainly wrong in your accusation, and if even you are correct, your accusation does nothing to discredit what the troll or bot says.
people need to cease falling back on the 'troll' and 'bot' accusations and accept that there are people in the world that genuinely disagree with them and that doesn't make that person a bad person.
twitter has a massive problem with this.
both sides under say, a trump tweet, tweet nothing but propaganda and insults - almost always not even related to trump's original tweet.
they both tweet utter garbage and are in turn both called bots by the other side.
its laughable.
ehhh there are a ton of opinions that i believe make you a bad person.
and just as it is their right to have those opinions, it is my right to have my opinion of them.
it shouldn't be a banworthy offense to actually call out suspicious behavior, though.
and you're slightly underselling the prevalence of botting, trolling, and brigading.
it's not some freaky rare occurrence to find an account with a stock username, created 9 months ago but only active in the last few days, whose only comments defend russia or trump in barely-passable english (or completely irrelevant stock replies).
i've seen it personally 3 or 4 times for certain, suspect a few more, and i've only been here for a few months.
i am not a bot, i live in nz and i am critical of my own government and others.
if i write something critical of the us government, i am accused of being a russian bot.
i am never accused of being an american bot if i write something critical of russia or china which i find very strange.
there is no doubt in my mind that all of these countries are active in this manner.
i genuinely appreciate it when i am corrected or better informed on a subject, i have grown to appreciate just how vast the collective knowledge of reddit is.
i really don't know what people are trying to achieve when accusing someone of being a bot, rather than responding to their statement.
i know they don't genuinely think i'm a bot, but for some reason they think that by accusing me of being one, they are discrediting my argument.
i really think it is a sign of a seriously dangerous mindset and as it really dous not add anything to the discussion, i feel like they should be banned.
bit of you call someone a nazi right winger you'll get gilded the rare double typo?
you don't see many of these in the wild i care.
what can i do to help minimize the spread of misinformation?
try to think critically about things and not only source them but think about the credibility and potential biases of the source.
in the context of reddit this means especially don't take headline's word for anything, or commenters claims.
unfortunately this doesn't do much overall when 95% of other people don't care people care but what are you going to do when even the ceo admits to manipulating user comments?
twitter may be the worst but you should know what you're getting into.
facebook is the worst because of the stupid trust levels people have with it also the amount of stupid people’s comments on facebook who also happen to receive the most amount of likes for some reason.
like ridiculously stupid, illogical but dead serious comments (mainly of outrage) and now they have it so the comment with the most replies rises to the top.
this means that the top comment is usually gonna be some antagonistic/trolling/divisive comment, because people will be arguing against it.
it really helps to spread misinformation even more, because it gets people who have no idea what they're talking about more engaged in the comments, which i'm sure only helps facebook's bottom line.
reddit is an effective tool because very few people read past the headline.
there is also a large number of people that jump to the comments to figure out what they "should" think about a certain topic.
i don't know how they compare relatively, but reddit is rife with social media bots or people.
it's easy to identify the ones working for news orgs, because they simply link to their organization's webpage.
r u bots are a lot harder to find because you have to recognize their speech patterns.
it's like when an english or scottish accent comes through.
they usually have call to actions and a very strong opinion.
sometimes they crosspost both sides on one account, through i've been seeing that less.
the platform that's most concerning is facebook.
i've heard a lot of people spouting a lot of views that seem to be more in line with foreign viewpoints than domestic.
that's where i think trolls are reaching the most people.
i was gonna make a comment about how twitter has more active users, but to my surprise it doesn’t.
reddit has nearly 100 million more monthly active users than twitter.
so twitter doesn’t even have that excuse.
yeah reddit isn’t perfect on that regard, but it’s obviously not nearly as much of an issue as no fuss was raised about it.
hell, i’ve never been contacted or replied to by a bot on here but nearly once a week i get spam messages and replies from bots on twitter.
&gt; that said i think it's pretty clear twitter is the worst of all the platforms in that regard i have a feeling facebook would give them a run for their money.
i agree.
twitter is full of, and expected to be full of, banality.
facebook is where people are deceived the most people always forget, reddit started off with the founders populating the boards and threads under various usernames and simulating discussions.
fake accounts are actually of feature of reddit &gt; i'm sure reddit, as with all other major social media players, has major issues with bots that they are choosing to not reveal because it boosts their value as a company.
that said i think it's pretty clear twitter is the worst of all the platforms in that regard issues?
reddit admins literally allowed david brock and "media matters", "correct the record" and "shareblue" to brigade subs during and after the 2016 election.
heres one of the leaked chat logs showing reddit admins discussing this very thing.. https://i.redd.it/n6o0e35sn5gy.png so ya.
lets not act like its *just* the russian state doing the bot brigading.
its very likely and plausible all kinds of groups are using the same russian bots to peddle their own narrative and influence.
its fact (as per the linked image above) that left wing groups are using bot voting to manipulate reddit.
just look at the echo chamber that use to discuss politics.
its ridiculous.
sorry, but where's the mention of bots in that log?
did i overlook it?
reddit is even more fucked.
people astroturfing everywhere, companies pushing their agenda, news sites botting their articles on here to get views, and oblivious people parroting talking points.
couldn't agree more.
as soon as someone successfully astroturfs some position, the reddit hivemind spreads the misinformation everywhere, through real people.
then you get real people expressing "their opinion" who are told they are shills, which they aren't.
they're carriers for this minsinformation virus.
and because of how our minds work, we're so susceptible to thinking we "know" a fact just because we saw it.
and we love parroting it on reddit.
the chances of any user being a carrier of some sort of intentional misinformation nears 100%.
yeah, reddit is the ideal platform for astroturfing.
it could be worse here than twitter, since we're so enamored with sharing what we think is our sincere opinion, rather than just retweeing something that might later be provably false.
this is the site that is now infamous for its hivemind "finding" the boston bomber, when in reality is blamed a kid who was already dead, regardless of what the authorities said.
sure there are smart minds on reddit, and while it is clear that bots or dedicated trolls / influencers exist, i do not discount the high probability that many of the claims of shills are coming from people who bought into the same hivemind as the boston bomber period, where they think they are too smart to fall for traps.
the main thought that brings me to this is how we see so many posts claiming to call out "russian trolls", or how to spot a "russian troll", when we have instances where the accounts making these claims conform to the same definition they give as a "russian troll".
honestly, if i was a russian troll, then there would be no point shilling pro russia or topics that russian trolls are associated with as it is too easy to be called out, alongside having plenty of people to hold that position.
the easiest position to manipulate and exploit right now is the mindset of many posters who think that they are immune to russian trolls and therefore blindly believe anybody else who also is opposed to russian trolls.
to me it comes down to: do i waste my time shilling to people who already side with me, or do i spend my time fucking with people who are trying to call out people like me, but will believe any insane bullshit i feed them as they think i am on *their side*.
as a consequence, the people who think they are too smart to be tricked by trolls end up pushing those in the middle away with the insane belief that russian trolls and shills are everywhere so end up accusing innocents of being trolls when in reality the trolls are pushing them into a further radicalized mindset.
fuck knows though.
we are all easily victims of astroturfing, i am not a smart man, so even i've fallen victim to believing complete bollocks before.
the one thing i do know, however, is trolling in the 2004-2007 era of 4chan, and how it was easiest to fuck with online communities by not shilling against them but by acting as a radical member and further radicalizing them internally.
they won't be convinced to agree with my original point of view, but their radicalized point of view can push others away from agreeing with them, alongside the paranoia making them oblivious to bullshit being fed to their side.
i mean, i'm not some master troll, but i knew that it was easier to fuck with people and get them all angry by being on their side and making them get to the point where they lose their shit at anybody who doesn't automatically agree with them than it is to disagree in the first place in an attempt to make them angry.
yup.
reddit is the worst.
it's changed me for the worst.
i've never hated people so much but i don't even know if the shit i read is even being said by real people.
some of the guys i know who use reddit a lot are way more sexist than they ever have been.
it has really fucked people in the head.
i think the informational subreddits are still very helpful.
i mostly use reddit to find programming tutorials.
most news on here is about america anyways, and the entertainment subreddits are getting flooded by companies shelling out their products.
i'm not really sure what sexist stuff you're talking about though, the only cesspool i was aware of was incels.
exactly.
i love r/fitness, a small game forum: r/tagpro, sometimes i read r/news (to extent that it doesn't make me too angry) but apart from that, i stick to r/jokes, r/funny, r/aww etc.
i come to reddit to feel good and learn a little.
not to hear opinions of bots/strangers.
reddit is very good if you don't take it seriously.
if you want to feel "engaged" on any special interest topics, reddit can be a hellhole.
special interest topics is where reddit shines because it’s not flooded by the masses and most people who care enough about the topic have experience with it.
it’s the more main stream stuff that goes to shit i kinda like that it might be bots, or an organized effort by some group.
if it wasn't that, i'd be pretty depressed about the state of this site and/or humanity.
like this heavily upvoted post here in this very sub about a bomb scare in germany, with all those "germany is fucked b/c refugees" bullshit: https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7gw4t8/german_police_find_christmas_market_bomb/ here's the one from a few days later, when the police released what they found out: https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7halzu/potsdam_bomb_scare_likely_aimed_at_blackmailing/ fucking ridiculous if you compare the amount of attention people spent on these stories.
well **i'm** not a bot.
good bot bad bot.
i am a bot and so is my wife.
that's exactly what a bot would say!
damn synths... everybody on reddit is a bot.
!isbot ghost4000 me neither.
but i don't know about these other blokes.
the fact that you have a 4000 in your username makes me suspicious.
i assure you that i am **not** in any way the four thousandth attempt at creating a bot that passes as a human.
what's interesting about reddit too is the private subreddits which could be used to co-ordinate activity.
unless the admins monitor them these private groups could be used for a lot of dodgy stuff.
most of these subs use outside apps like discord to coordinate rather than private subs.
yea, like /r/a858de45f56d9bc9/ we *still* haven't figured out what the hell this is being used for.
and i've been following it for 5 years.
i saw a post once that explaned that you don't need to do much to sway the up/downvote on reddit .
just one or 2 up/down votes at the start have a major impact on the total of up/down votes a post or responce gets.
i think you're thinking of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxnvuwn3vyk costs just $200 for a frontpage reddit post.
companies buy accounts with real posting histories so they can't easily be detected.
make your post at the right time, a handful of botnetted accounts upvote it almost immediately, reddit's sorting algorithm sees it's popular and pushes it to real people who continue to upvote.
kicks off a positive feedback loop and you hit the front page.
the independent was once a quality outlet that was bought by a russian oligarch and literally half or more of its traffic now probably comes from clickbait reddit articles.
i read 80% at one point but i can't for the life of me find it now.
oh you mean like the independent anti trump spam at r/worldnews there is no doubt there was a huge effort on reddit as well.
looking back to r/politics during the primaries and how many right wing sources were upvoted attacking hillary...it was nuts.
the place was completely overwhelmed to the point i couldn't even go there anymore and had to find reasonable people in other subs to hang out in.
the admins and the mods let it happen.
it was obvious.
but maybe they didn't imagine it would go this badly.
but their continued lack of response to it is pretty disgusting.
it's almost enough that you want to do something like voat...except make it for decent people.
&gt; looking back to r/politics during the primaries and how many right wing sources were upvoted attacking hillary...it was nuts.
r/politics has always been a mess, which was why it was removed the list of defaults way back in *2013*.
it was bernie bernie bernie during the primaries, then curiously switched over to hillary hillary hillary way before he even dropped out.
today, practically every upvoted story has the word trump in it.
quite frankly, all default subs are a mess.
the higher the user count pretty much always indicates the place is going to be inundated with astroturfing and idiots.
&gt; today, practically every upvoted story has the word trump in it.
well, yeah, he's the president.
like it or not, presidents tend to make political news, and trump is abnormally loud and obnoxious, even for a president.
/u/parotidlahar probably meant that the upvoted articles are all *negative* to the president.
from "sources" like buzzfeed, shareblue, huffpo... &gt;the upvoted articles are all negative to the president.
given the reality of his time in office, what else would you expect?
&gt;from "sources" like buzzfeed, shareblue, huffpo... buzzfeed's news arm is decent enough.
the other two, sure, i'd drop em.
i'd also drop breitbart and possibly foxnews.
&gt; i'd also drop breitbart and possibly foxnews.
yea i don't think those two are an issue on r/politics.
what is shareblue?
i asked about it in /r/politics and got downvoted.
i suspected it was shills or bots downvoting me because i brought it up.
no replies at all.
https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/23/us/politics/hillary-clinton-media-david-brock.html hes historically unpopular.
yeah most articles are going to be negative.
well, he is literally the worst president in my lifetime and will certainly go down as one of the worst in our history.
just based on his constant lying alone.
why would you think he deserves positive press?
what in gods name are you taking about.
politics was pro bernie.
then it went off the deep end for pro hilary.
nothing bad was ever posted about her.
the mods would ban anyone who even mentioned correct the record.
a few weeks ago i saw shareblue cited as a source.
the mods won't ban you for a conservative opinion but you'll be downvoted.
it's the only sub i have blocked presently.
i'm pretty sure i was banned from politics for saying "wow, you really corrected the record" i was banned for ending a sentence with the word "comrade."
there was a very anti- hillary sentiment for quite a while on politics.
till she was the pick.
then the sub did a complete 180. within less than a day it seemed it was quite impressive there was a big push by russian bots to jump on the dem split after the primary.
they inflamed the bernie supporters and attempted to drive a wedge between them and the hilary camp.
they didn't *create* the wedge, but they definitely were out there trying to prevent a reconciliation.
even after bernie urged them to, the russian bots were working to keep them from voting for her.
interesting, and pretty plausible.
i'd love to see if there is evidence of this.
i applaud you for pointing out they didn't create the wedge, because c'mon - people are totally capable of doing these things on their own.
every time we blame something 100% on bots we're missing the point.
i didn't save anything, but i looked up a lot of the bernie supporters posting things to /r/politics and many of them were active on /r/t_d.
it was pretty obvious back during that crazy time.
uh, you are full of complete garbage.
during the primaries it was non-stop breitbart articles that were bashing hillary.
even after the primaries, there was a ton of hillary bashing going on though it got a tiny bit better.
r/politics has strict rules on calling people names.
i called out an obvious troll and was banned for it.
they had the same rule on saying someone was ctr (which was stupid and still is).
still today breitbart is allowed to be submitted despite it directly being far right propaganda.
shareblue has sensationalized headlines...but i would be fine ditching it if they got rid of straight up propaganda.
breitbart is straight propaganda but shareblue isnt?
in general i think overreading shilling into reddit is probably a mistake.
it almost certainly happens, but the setup of the site itself is basically really well made to make subreddits into circlejerks, in the absence of very strict moderation.
plus, they didn't do anything to prevent the donald from taking over the front page with manipulation until after the election.
then they added some changes which fixed it... sorta... but also broke the site so news doesn't rise up as fast.
&gt; then they added some changes which fixed it.
yeah, admins publicly setting high posts to zero really helped show us no censorship is happening...then the ceo of reddit personally editing comments he didn't like.... really fixing things.
rofl, still with the "zeroing our posts" meme.
do you also still think t_d has 5 million subscribers and spez is causing it to display incorrectly on the sidebar?
edit: oh god that submission history.
please don't even answer my previous question.
interesting how my comment riled them up...... the admins did not set posts on the_donald to zero.
those posts made it to the front page and the general public downvoted the shit out of them.
when a post has more downvotes than upvotes it sits at zero.
the algorithm takes time to correct itself so they may linger even after getting slammed with downvotes.
the reality is that most of the content from t_d that reaches the general reddit audience isn’t popular and imo, wrong and annoying.
it’s not a conspiracy.
there won't be because it's content they like start with /r/politics and work out from there.
but how many of those followers were real people and how many were bots?
the bots are inflating the number of users on twitter; i don't think twitter wants to know how many are out there.
oh twitter knows.
they just don’t want their investors to know.
or advertisers.
will we get to a point where bots are advertising to only bots?
i'm sure we're already there.
now, if i could get a bot that collects incorrect info for other bots, that would be sweet.
http://adnauseam.io of course there is.
banned from chrome though... honestly, why do i use this piece of shit browser lol any alternative suggestions?
you can still install it on chrome.
just have to enable developer mode.
click the chrome icon on the site and you can get it going in seconds.
it also works for firefox and opera.
this tricks ads and shit giving them useless data, which is fun.
if you want to kill ads on your entire network setup pi-hole.net on a machine and point your routers dns to that box.
you can go super crazy and run openvpn on the same box and use it for you mobile as well when not on your home network.
so much this.
twitter is a dead platform for advertisers who aren't huge brands, but they want you to believe that because those huge brands do it, you can as well.
twitter is good at spreading information like wildfire, but if you don't have something people care about, you're just chucking money out the window.
nah, i've botted before.
its cat and mouse.
the noob botters are always detected, the pros are always a step or two ahead of the game.
why would the investors care?
they invested in a company that makes no money and has no plans to change that.
and is twitter going to notify those accounts that they were following propaganda from a hostile state under the guise of news?
i think that’s the most important step after disabling the fake accounts.
the users probably don't care.
they'll just rush to the next account to follow that validates their feelings.
as long as journalists consider twitter fights news, it doesn't matter.
bot a tweets something offensive.
bots b, c, and d tweet back.
journalist reports on twitter fight and uses tweets in the story.
story circulates.
at no point does it matter if a, b, c, and d were real people.
it really is amazing how many fake twitter accounts there are.
there are thousands and thousands of “stan” accounts for people like bieber, selena gomez, 1direction that are obviously fake when you click on the account.
excellent point!
yes, there are!
edit: i mean, my own screen name is simply two hockey teams that i like along with my first name, but there are some accounts that smell of fake big time.
facebook is completely infested with russian trolls, if i had to estimate, there are double what there were in january.
i wouldn't worry about it, very few actual users on twitter anyways.
like 5 years ago i read that 90% of twitter content was made and consumed by 10% of twitter users.
does't seem that serious.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(internet_culture) here you go no word on twitter's artificial manipulation of what is or isn't "trending".
i think the following is the most important part of the article and is something everyone will need to be more vigilant about in order to protect democracy.
&gt; researchers say another purpose of the accounts was to establish them as trusted news sources, and then activate them later to spread propaganda and disinformation.
troll factories have taken that approach before.
during the escalating tensions between russia and ukraine in 2014, nimmo observed various online forums and platforms linked to russian troll factories that would ingratiate themselves in the pro-ukrainian community by posting favorable information.
then after gaining credibility, those sites would shift their tone to write stories that expressed discontent with ukraine.
&gt; &gt; in fact, nimmo says these news imposter accounts may have been created for an operation that never happened.
a u.s. intelligence report concluded that the russian government was expecting hillary clinton to win the election and were prepared to call into question the validity of the results.
pro-kremlin bloggers had prepared a twitter campaign, #democracyrip on election night in anticipation of her victory, according to the report.
these news imposter accounts could have aided those efforts to undermine the election results by promoting certain hashtags and topics like “voter fraud” or “rigged election."
by having a network of local news accounts across the country, the kremlin would be able to distribute propaganda at scale that could galvanize local populations to protest, according to nimmo.
a russian-linked facebook group attempted to organize anti-immigrant and anti-hillary clinton protests in texas shortly before the november elections.
&gt; &gt; the majority of the imposter news accounts were created more than a year before the 2016 u.s. elections.
the history of tweets and engagement with real users improves the placement of the account and its posts in twitter's search results, according to kris shaffer, a data scientist doing research for university of mary washington and the data for democracy.
that means that if the account does push major disinformation campaigns, it is less likely to be blocked.
&gt; &gt; shaffer's analysis of the accounts found that several of the imposter news accounts also tweeted during the french presidential election.
he surfaced about 41 tweets from accounts including @worldnewspoli, @todaymiami, @detroitdailynew, and @chicagodailynew.
most of the posts were retweets of local news articles, but more than a quarter of them included stories from truthfeed.com, a known disinformation site, according to shaffer.
those stories were mostly attacking emmanuel macron, who won the election, and biased toward marine le pen, a far-right politician in france.
this highlights the long game that putin is playing.
the problem, as i see it, is without the cooperation of fb, twitter, reddit, etc., there really isn't anyway to proactively (or at lease concurrently) stop the propaganda.
this is truly mind boggling.
they are playing a very long game here and they have basically rigged the levers of profit seeking companies to make sure it's in those companies interest to allow them to persist.
the last thing facebook and twitter want to do is reduce their page views or user counts.
of course, like 50% of twitter is bots.
bots following bots.
inception!
artifical ignorance.
and yet the biggest remains, making hyuuge, baseless and inane comments?
their hearts ain't in it.
this is why social media is garbage.
it perpetuates false news and high school drama.
ultimately it lies on the individuals that blindly share without cross referencing and fact checking.
something is finally being done about this.
stop being so spineless, zuck i wonder how many of that 500k actually believe these were kremlin backed news sources now that this has occurred, and how many have their tin foil hats on claiming deep state took down the real news sources.
not very good with the internetz, but when i checked out a couple of the twitter accounts mentioned in the article all it looked like was news postings with not even a dozen likes (unless likes don't show up like [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20160620041108/https://twitter.com/todaynycity/status/744588336749109248)) at this point i dont even think that gop will care.
their voters are brainwashed beyond redemption.
if theres one thing that trump was spot on was his statement "i could shoot somebody and not lose any voters" it's not just a republican thing, as much as you would want it to be.
take a look at hashtags like #resist and you'll find dozens of bots spamming messages as well.
yup.
the goal is to further the divide.
purposely triggering articles up voted/liked/followed by armies of bots to fake support.
turned the information super highway into a troll parade.
i don't think the goal is *always* to divide, but even when it isn't, its a common outcome.
&gt;there were both left-leaning and right-leaning accounts.
did you not read the article?
what the fuck are you talking about?
this isn't /r/politics, mate.
i mean, multiple studies have shown a causal link between low intelligence and prejudice (in the forms of racism, sexism, religious fanatism etc).
prejudice is everything trump represents so gop voters being immune to reason shouldnt surprise anyone.
source on that?
i'm interested if you have a link.
[is racism just a form of stupidity?
the short answer is yes](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/were-only-human/is-racism-just-a-form-of-stupidity.html) uh, your source is literally an op-ed and doesn't contain any sources of its own and is the author "summing up" studies using unprofessional language no credible scientist would use.
&gt;one such study looked at general intelligence in 10- and 11-year-old kids, and then re-studied those kids as adults two decades later—and found a clear connection between low intelligence and subsequent racism and sexism.
similarly, higher intelligence in childhood has been shown to predict less racism in adulthood.
these analyses strongly suggest that low intelligence actually leads to hateful attitudes later on.
"one study"?
this is supposedly a highly educated researcher.
what study?
do you even have a name for it so we can look it up?
it honestly reads like a long-form reddit comment you'd find at the top of a thread in /r/politics.
**edit:** i looked up dhont and hodson whose research he keeps mentioning and uh... yeah i don't think these two scientists can be taken particularly seriously.
[here's a study they did about political ideology and eating meat.
](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s0195666316308923) it's completely full of subjective opinions and ridiculous statements that belie an intense bias.
here's how they described reasons why left-wing people eat meat: "personal inconvenience", "meat cravings", "awkwardness in social settings", and "health/nutrition concerns".
here's how they described reasons why right-wing people eat meat: "hedonistic", "human supremacy", "entitlement", and "animal exploitation".
these two are a couple of twats.
in america or other similar multicultural societies sure.
i think the link is that lower intelligence means that you have more trouble with the unknown and ambiguous data, and things that don't have a very simple explanation.
racism has a trifecta for people like that.
no ambiguity (blacks lose because dumb and violent), nothing unknown (you can know that guy whether or not you bother to talk to him), and the explanation is simple (bio truths).
replace "gop" with "democratic party" and trump with "hillary" and it would be equally true.
just saying.
"they suspended the accounts because they have a political agenda and don't want us to know the *truth!
*" you realize the kremlin was producing pro-trump, anti-trump, pro-bernie, pro-hillary, etc fake news?
their goal was to produce chaos all around.
i don't remember any of it being pro-hillary.
it was def pro-bernie, pro-trump and maybe pro-jill stein their top goal was getting the magnitsky act repealed, second was sowing chaos.
the best chance to get the magnitsky act repealed was via trump so they most definitely were trying to get trump elected.
lol fuck off liar.
name one single headline that was russian propaganda that was pro hillary.
he sexually assaulted many people and still won the presidency, so yeah.
weird how t_d are angry about this here... it would be hilarious if this comment was made by a bot.
they are?
this claim doesn't seem to check out we are?
it says that "there were both left-leaning and right-leaning accounts".
imo this is really no different than the msm (on both sides) jumping to false conclusions and manipulating the truth on a daily basis.
they got played.
being played causes shame and embarrasment, and that in turn forces a decision: reject what you thought was true and thus undermine who you thought you were, or double-down and attack those trying to pop your bubble.
&gt; they got played.
they willingly sought to be played.
no kidding.
they swallowed putin's cock right down to his balls.
i really don't see how they "got played" when trump is in the white house.
because it wasn't their success, it was russia's and they got used.
i doubt that.
plus the article mentions both sides got played.
&gt; @blacknewsoutlet, one of the fake accounts, had more than 40,000 followers and had a description of "freedom is never given; it is won.
#blacklivesmatter."
tweets from this account frequently posted news about social unrest or headlines to incite anger.
a retweeted post from @blacknewsoutlet on oct. 19, 2016 read: "how many more black lives needed to change the rotten police systems?"
of course, the russians want a divided america.
but if you read about their behavior on facebook, it was quite amazing.
they would make bro-black lives matters or pro-jewish advertisements, and then they would make sure that only conservatives saw it.
it riled up the base.
they made a lot of stein and sanders stuff too, and flooded it on liberal members.
it's harder to target that on twitter, so they just make items that are decisive and create chaos.
but both sides had their own agenda.
as an analogy, consider back when [america armed afghanistan's mujahideen in the 1980s.
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_cyclone) were the afghans "played" and "used" when they drove out the ussr?
or had they successfully exploited international politics to fulfil their own goals?
you could spin it either way.
trump turned out to be pretty much the opposite of what they thought he was i guess, but it's still better than hillary for them so it doesn't matter.
the choice was binary.
the supreme court nomination, muslim ban etc are all things that they wanted.
[removed] well, for a lot of them, it was their accounts.
please fellow american computer twiter comrades to be follow me at new account @nkvd1!
much not fake news to be given daily!
followed!
please tell me how special i am and how everyone that isn't my race or doesn't have the same beliefs as me is trying to kill me and how we can have a wall build between us and them!
kthxbai twitter needs a report possible bot option.
i report as many bots as i can, but it’s difficult to block them all, bc most follow the guidelines... no harassment, not a hacked account, etc.
you know when an account is posting and retweeting hundreds of tweets an hour for days, something is not right.
whew!
just in time!
thank god twitter did this before any damage was done.
“dozens”.
twitter: least amount of effort applied.
i take it this was after they begged rt to buy advertising space during the election?
twitter is a joke.
kind of wish they would suspend the accounts of television personalities masqueradimg as news journalists.
what i'd like to know is, how did they determine they're "kremlin backed"?
simply because they were using russian ips?
anyone from the world can acquire russian servers and do this on them.
i have gotten accounts banned for being a "russian troll".
there are just sensitive topics in america that you can't talk about and if you do your comments or accounts get deleted for "russian trolling".
i am canadian but that doesn't seem to matter.
i've been opposed to most wars the us has fought in my lifetime, but god damm we should level that russian troll factory.
imho, people who work there are no less combatants than men with rifles, and much more dangerous to our democracy.
why do the russians not hide their ips?
that is a good question.
i assume they knew only twitter could see their ip's, but assumed they'd never bother looking.
i wonder how many innocent vpn/tor users were snared in the crossfire....as i always reddit through tor.
today, i am an austrian :) you want bots?
reddit's got all the bots you need.
i’m wondering how they figure they were kremlins backed accounts?
rather than normal conservative papers tweeted accounts.
veles, yugoslavia.
facebook and twitter have tracked these accounts origin back to this city and others like it.
ip addresses.
even if they're masked or something, i'm sure you can find patterns.
the ip address doesn't mean anything.
have you ever heard of a vpn.
i could easily change mine to show a russian ip address source the the internet research agency is an arm of the kremlin?
just because ip addresses were traced to russia/ira does not necessarily indicate that it was backed by the kremlin if that is true, they don't understand proxies.
i'm not debating there *aren't* bot farms but they could easily use something like tor.
they could all appear out the same exit node.
the article states that the accounts targeted both political spectrums to move each side further into extremism.
so i wouldn't get excited calling only trump followers idiots.
and before those who say this is a false narrative, as the numbers might not be equal, that doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things.
this can be looked at alternatively as the opposing side doesn't need as much pushing to go off the deep end.
the bottom line is that both the left and the right were played, and that should be scary to any rational person.
source the the internet research agency is an arm of the kremlin?
why can't any article demonstrate the connection?
&gt; "we take seriously reports that the power of our service was misused by a foreign actor for the purpose of influencing the u.s. presidential election and undermining public faith in the democratic process," does that include trump?
well considering the fact that twitter offered rt a preferential advertising deal, it's more than a little hypocritical of them to come out now pretending like they're fucking white knights of technology here to save america.
&gt; "we take seriously reports that the power of our service was misused by a foreign actor bloody shatner again.
isn’t that exactly what twitter wants?
large social influence utilizing their platform?
not yet, but they see the writing on the wall regarding his impeachment.
we will soon have a whack job evangelical as president.
jesus tittyfucking christ... you mean the guy sitting next to everyone else in the meetings?
if you want to fix the fake news cycle, take it one step past notifying user who saw fake news.
notify the users as to who reposted the article(s), if your friends and followers knew you were reposting garbage you might think twice before reposting a click bait article.
about a year late, idiots.
they knew what they were doing.
hmph, only the tip of the iceberg it would be nice if the subscribers got notified that the account that they subscribed was kicked for this.
it might help close the loop so they are less susceptible to the next bot.
would be nice if could suspend some of the celebrity accounts with 500k followers that act like they are news to push their agendas too.
just in the nick of time!
i wonder is trump’s account was one of those?
proof that the ira (internet research agency) is ran by the kremlin?
they say "kremlin backed" and in the headline "kremlin tried" but i see nothing of significance to suggest that the ira is an arm of the kremlin.
just out of curiosity id like to know the forensic digital evidence linking these bots to the kremlin.
i see a lot of claims of russian connections to a lot of things and very little evidence being provided to the public at large substantiating claims like this bandaid solution.
fix your society so they don't believe this bs.
education.
too late for that, whats left of it is being demolished by the gop and betsy devos.
doesn't matter.
twitter still hasn't banned the kremlin's star player for violating their tos.
i'm pretty sure he'll be impeached before that happens.
right?
and yet they'll suspend uma thurman for acknowledging that harvey weinstein is scum.
a bunch of kemliin-backed twitter accounts get banned.
no surprise, a bunch on t_d accounts come on here to pretend it's no big deal.
&gt;there were both left-leaning and right-leaning accounts.
maybe try reading the article?
so many things about the russian social media stuff confuses me.
like: &gt; information on the details of the accounts was gathered from meltwater, a data intelligence firm that monitors social media.
who is meltwater and why are they being used as opposed to twitter itself?
or the defense dept?
i read their wikipedia page and there's nothing to make me believe that they are anything more than a newsclipping service.
they bought some ai companies but that doesn't mean that there methods are accurate.
if they have hard evidence i'd love to see it.
it would be fascinating to see how they connect accounts to the russians.
&gt; researchers have concluded that many of the ira-linked accounts were created to sow social discord, by trying to "put left-wing people further to the left and right-wing people further to the right," said ben nimmo, a senior fellow at the atlantic council digital forensic research lab.
"it's that attempt to amplify the differences in society."
this just seems too vague to be true.
i could understand russian intelligence trying to make people pro-russia or against certain foreign policy issues, but general discord?
sounds like something from the red scare of the 50s.
i'm not saying that russia isn't doing this.
something's clearly up.
it's just the facts of these cases are a mess.
keep on fighting windmills, meanwhile the rich get richer.
[deleted] is it even a narrative at this point?
i feel like it's been pretty well established that the russian government has a strong internet presence dedicated towards pushing certain ideas.
i’ve always wondered how many reddit accounts are just russian trolls the ones pedaling ctr during the election, no doubt.
hope those people get out of there safely.
also, best wishes to live updates on finding a new job.
prayers for those who are in the area of this threat.
thots and prayers wishes and hope.
do you guys want some water ?
man... sarah jessica parker really went off the deep end.
he sounds unstable to me i don't think so.
he was holding a stable relationship.
nothing wrong with a little horseplay when the horse was asked if they consented they said neigh... must have been jrhnbr.
how does a horsefucker know how to treat a girlfriend?
"hey, fucko, we like to call it inter-species erotica."
&gt; he had the mare’s tail in his hand and was pressing hard against the mare’s rear end that's it?
i'm not convinced.
there's probably a very simple, innocent explanation hillary goes by ruby now?
this is what the democratic party promotes, awful who are we to judge their love?
the horse was saying hay, not heeeeeey~ how?
i don't know a lot about horses but couldn't a horse that doesn't want you behind it simply kick your testicles through your butthole?
it wasn't even his horse!
i remember when they blew up lord mountbatten why keep fighting?
they got the good friday agreement, catholics are outbreeding protestants and all sides are committed to accept the outcome of the vote when it happens, and ireland is going to accept them back in a landslide if the north wants it.
why risk losing all that?
because some people hold a grudge the troubles is an interesting conflict i wish was taught more often in the us.
are there any window surfaces that could protect pilots?
solid aluminum would do the trick.
yes, [transparent aluminum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xavgrj2e5_s) he said solid!
can it be a one way mirror?
it probably doesn't have the required characteristics for a windscreen?
[removed] spoken by someone who has no idea how to pilot a plane... i mean that would be why he formed his comment into a question.
pilots do almost all the flying still, despite what people imagine as "auto pilot" landing and takeoff requires skill and those guys and gals have it.
keeping a plane in the sky is not necessarily as difficult but there are thousands of decisions to make that require human input at this point in time.
it might happen in the future but its a very manual process still and i'm okay with that it's a mix.
we don't pay mainline pilots six figures a year to fly the plane every day, as any mediocre pilot could do that.
a lot of the pilots use automation a large part of the time, including landing.
we pay them six figures a year to be there to keep the plane from crashing when shit goes wrong, like with sully.
but is it automation like we would interpret it for vehicles per se?
i know altitude and pitch/roll/yaw are probably controlled by gps/imu but i assume at least one pilots job is to ensure things aren't going awry.
i should learn more about it, the waypoint system is something i've used in my own work, the concept, not the automated aspects.
other than the take-off, a pilot could fly many of the newer planes, including landing at many airports, by doing nothing but inputting way-points and altitudes into the autopilot.
there's enough automation that many people fear that some pilots are getting a bit rusty by not getting enough hands on time.
at the same time, the air traffic control system needs a full upgrade before we're ready for more automated flying.
another thing to think about is human intuition, or a pilot's gut feeling about what to do in an emergency.
on the one hand, sully did what a computer wouldn't do, saving the plane.
at the same time, many plane crashes happened because the pilots disregarded the computer and/or instruments.
interesting points, thanks for the insight!
would you fly in one of them?
yes, actually.
for single-engine planes and they haven't been approved by the faa yet.
pretty sure it was stroking the cane that caused this problem to begin with i love that caning is still a punishment in australia singapore.
he's australian but the offenses happened in singapore.
oooohhh ok, that makes more sense then i *wish* that caning were still a punishment in australia.
seriously, for moderate-severity offences (vandalism, shoplifting and the like) i think it's actually pretty damn good.
give someone a $100,000 fine and they probably can't afford to pay it.
give them a six months in prison, and they probably come out a worse criminal.
but give them a hundred lashes and they've had a cheap, efficient, easy punishment which will make them think twice about doing it again.
the novel starship troopers made a good argument for corporal punishment along those lines: the whole point of punishment is that you apply it when you think that inflicting some degree of suffering on a person might correct their behavior.
the most direct form of suffering to inflict is physical pain, and if the person is going to be productive again they get back to it more quickly.
i could see how corporal punishment would be better than a lot of the punishments we use.
of course, sociological studies into the effect of corporal punishment suggest it is far from the most effective method.
an we get the cane thing in america please?
honestly, i think it would be a great idea.
if you have me the option between a couple canings or months in jail, i'd pick the canings, spend a couple days recovering and move on with my life i don't think it's an option.
you don't learn how to be a better criminal when you're caned.
you go into jail a novice and come out in a few months a pro.
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zpfebfpawy) (nsfw) is a video of what caning looks like.
you don't recover from it in 'a couple of days'.
can we get the cane thing in alabama, please?
.
.
i'm talking to you, roy moore...!
this is federal, so he's actually going to be spending the rest of his life in prison.
he's not going to be getting paroled after 10 years.
hes awaiting sentencing in mi for csc charges.
the **minimum** sentence will be between 25 and 60 years, maximum is life.
he's never getting out of prison.
if/when he's released from the feds, he'll be bussed or flown to mi to serve the rest of his sentence.
edit: formatting probably won't last 10 years anyways.
prison is a tough place for people in for crimes against children.
i thought they kept people like this segregated so they don't get passed around like a sexual football.
it's federal prison, he will be protected.
good, may he rot in there for life nassar is also awaiting sentencing in two michigan counties (ingham and eaton) for some csc charges.
the **minimum** sentence will be between 25 and 60 years, maximum is life.
he's never getting out of prison.
if/when he's released from the feds, he'll be bussed or flown to mi to serve the rest of his sentence.
not just an officer, but a captain; and this is her third incident of making inappropriate comments to colleagues.
a second cop - who was the target of her latest comment— was also suspended 2 days for stating he was offended by her remarks.
i think that one is bs.
he asked her to expand on some statistics and she told him he wouldn’t understand because of his ‘white male privilege’, so he left the room.
this stuff is getting ridiculous.
no one has the right to dismiss someone else’s life experiences and suggest they haven’t struggled or faced adversity because of their gender or color of their skin.
a supervisor certainly shouldn’t be saying it to colleagues.
i remember when making assumptions about a person based on their race was called 'racism'.
2017, what a time to be alive.
[deleted] i know this is going to be contentious, but i think it's fair to question what doesn't align with your experience.
i remember in college, i had to take a sexual harassment training which stated that 1 in 4 women have been raped.
that number seems insanely high to me and does not match what i've seen.
but because the statistic doesn't include my demographic, i'm not allowed to be sceptical or question where this information came from?
&gt; that number seems insanely high to me and does not match what i've seen.
that's because that statistic counts sexual encounters that a woman regrets the next day as rape along with cat-calling.
yeah if it was actually 1 in 4, who would send there child into that kind if environment?
&gt; who would send there child into that kind if environment?
no one would.
[deleted] &gt;now, am i correct?
probably not.
i can guess, but statistically, i’m probably wrong.
yet, that’s what this cop was doing.
that's what both cops were doing then.
the woman was saying he had "white male privilege", but she's not a white male, so by your logic, she has no grounds to speculate on the experience of someone who is.
my point is that statistics don't always tell the full story.
they're rarely generated by people with no agenda.
for example, the 1 in 4 statistic i mentioned in my last comment was from a sample of women who volunteered to take a survey about rape and some answers were manipulated through interpretation.
there's an inherent bias because the groups collecting this data are the ones benefiting from an inflated number.
now in this case, the article didn't mention the specifics, so i can't say anything about that.
but i can say that if a stat doesn't match you (admittedly anecdotal) perception of reality, it's your right to be sceptical.
in fact, it's encouraged in science.
even if the claim completely agrees with your experiences, it's still perfectly valid to be skeptical.
an individual's experiences are hardly the bar for proof of a claim, and even things which seem intuitively correct can be wrong.
[deleted] &gt;so she isn’t allowed to tell him he’s wrong for using stories to refute stats?
she definitely is, but it's hypocritical to say that he's wrong because he isn't in the demographic being talked about and then say the reason for his mistake is him being from a demographic of which she isn't a part.
also, &gt; [he] sought clarity on some statistics cited by trainers because they didn't reflect what he has experienced during his career in law enforcement.
he wasn't refuting them, according this article (which probably has some bias of its own).
we measure problems in society by examining both sides of an argument and doing our best to objectively remove bias, or at least recognize that it exists.
you can't blindly accept a claim just because there's some cherrypicked stat to back it up.
the stat probably has some value, but it's society's job to be sceptical and find out the full story.
[deleted] &gt;so you think i can speak intelligently about what it’s like to be a black woman?
are you generalizing the experiences of all individual black women into a single representation of "what it's like?"
you don't know exactly what it's like to be a particular black woman any more than one black woman knows what its like to be another black woman.
everyone has different life experiences, but that doesn't mean we can't speak intellectually about them.
i'm sure you have black women in your life and your experiences have enough in common that you can have an intelligent discussion.
you wouldn't know every detail, but you could at least make an educated guess.
&gt; are you generalizing the experiences of all individual black women into a single representation of "what it's like?"
of course he is.
that’s how all this social justice stuff works.
it’s just collectivism via skin color.
no he asked for a source of the stats because it didn't match his experience, that is not dismissing the statistic.
asking for clarification is not the same as declaring the statistic wrong.
and instead of providing the source of the statistic he was told his white privilege made his question irrelevant.
[deleted] yes, he asked for a source and stated why he wanted a source.
but instead of discussing it like an adult, he was told his white privilege was why, which only refuted his personal anecdotes but doesn't answer the question of where the statistic came from.
i'd say pointing out his race and gender refuted nothing.
[deleted] [removed] saying "i've never encountered this or heard of this before, what is your source?"
is acceptable for any and all claims.
you make a claim the burden is on you to back it up, not the burden is on me to refute or accept your claim.
here is an example.
vaccines cause autism.
i have never heard or experienced that, do you have any sources?
your kids never had autism so you wouldn't understand.
that is not an acceptable line of reasoning.
i don't understand and don't believe you so i want more than just your words.
if you cannot proved that then i reject your claim.
for the people who don't enjoy reading: officer is a middle aged white woman trying to put my finger on it... jeff daniels?
weird to see a controversy with the police on this end of the spectrum for once.
\&gt; waits patiently for the reddit free speech brigade^tm to come and defend this woman government as employer is actually an interesting 1st amendment question that has spawned some specific case law.
in this case, because the speech was related to her official duties, it does not receive much in the way of protection.
cf.
garcetti v. ceballos &gt;we hold that when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for first amendment purposes, and the constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.
even if this wasn't part of her duties, it would still likely be unprotected speech given that the statement was not made as a private citizen on a matter of public concern.
keep nerfing the world.
even cops are soft now.
she is clearly a moron.
move on.
even worse on the chief if he couldn't already look at the character of this loser on his force previous to any complaints.
i didn't read this article because the website is so awful.
she's right.
but that's not the place to say it.
she sounds racist and sexist, assuming things about a person based on their race and sex.
male white privilege is not something you assume, it's just something that is present in our society.
she shouldn't have said it but she's right, unless you're a minority gender like trans then you can never truly understand what it's like to be trans.
i'm male and white and do my best to be as inclusive as possible to everyone but i don't deny my privilege.
i want to know what she said at the firing range.
i like her.
not that she's right, or that she has the right, but that the plainfield police dept has had nothing to get this excited about since that irresponsible ben affleck closed the zzz accounting agency overnight, leaving all those clients in the lurch.
every department needs someone like captain weber.
not even the right plainfield you moron.
good- fuck them.
of course this will be shit for customers as sce will surely use it as another excuse to raise rates.
hope they’re bought out by tesla in a cruel twist of fate.
there’s no money in the long term for power companies anymore.
edit: i got downvotes with no comments?
maybe i should explain.
the business model power companies use is based on producing/selling electricity and delivering that power through the grid.
however, in the past couple decades, the demand for power has declined as many companies and homeowners are now capable of generating their own power through solar.
solar has only become cheaper and more accessible, and it is likely this trend will continue.
that means the main revenue stream for these companies is disappearing.
i know we still need fossil and hydro at this point because solar is not entirely reliable enough yet, and we don’t have practical or affordable ways to store power when the sun is not generating... yet.
so power companies, to maintain the grid, have to keep generation facilities operational, even though they aren’t generating/selling as much power as before, but at a similar expense in order to maintain the grid.
the costs associated with maintaining power lines and substations is fairly consistent, hopefully newer more reliable transformers will lead to less future maintenance, but at this point, there are still a lot of costs involved to keep the grid.
you can already see the effects of this, pge is cutting annual operations budget by millions, laying of many employees and contractors.
yet, your bill still went up even though they spent less this year.
now look 20 - 30 years in the future.
home battery back ups may become standard hardware.
solar roofs may become building code, pretty soon a modern home can generate its own electricity and store it long enough for the sun to come out.
and just in case, they might have a high efficiency generator as a back up.
the demand for power and to be connected to grid would likely also decline.
so my point is, why would tesla get involved in a failing industry?
they don’t want to maintain an old grid, they are the ones reimagining the role of the power company altogether.
if you’re young and looking for a career, power generation is not a good long term option, unless it’s for renewables and alternative energy sources.
even elon musk says they're not here to replace up electric companies.
maybe if they’re lucky they’ll also get blamed and sued for the fires like pg&amp;e has in northern california.
it's hard to believe those fires were started by pg&amp;e power lines being knocked down.
i sail in the bay and the winds out here are always strong.
they tried to [claim the winds were near 70 mph that night, but were 30-40mph](http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/10/12/california-fires-pge-power-lines-fell-in-winds-that-werent-hurricane-strength/), which isn't that out of the ordinary.
idk, maybe they were, but that many fires all starting in various location in such a short time span, with those kind of winds seemed odd to me.
i thought is was because of poor tree maintenance, a limb or tree fell on the line causing a large swath of the lines to hit the ground and spark over a long distance.
the lack on maintenance is where they are being blamed.
there were a [bunch of different fires all over the north bay](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/national/northern-california-fires/img/napa-fires-2300.jpg) that stared with in an hour or so, it just seems like this would be alot more common, it's not unusual for them to see winds around those speeds.
edit: changed link to a better map, i don't think the 1st one was working.
on mobile so i can find a better one tomorrow if you're interestes.
yes this map is much better.
thank you.
the clustering does make it look even more like they may have had a single cause for each cluster, but there are distinctly different clusters which does seems odd if it were just wind related.
i would expect 1 or 2 areas tightly grouped but this is more tightly on some and varied in others.
hopefully we do get definitive answers before next season.
prevention is the only real treatment option we have.
i lived on a somewhat remote property 3 years ago.
pg&amp;e was on that property at least every 3 months for "maintenance".
after the 3 or 4th time i straight told the worker that he is full of shit.
he asked me what i mean?
i told him that it's clear they think i'm stealing power and they are coming to check the lines, so fuck you.
i find it interesting that they would send people an hour or more out to that spot just to spend an hour doing nothing when they have maintenance issues in other places.
fuck pg&amp;e. wasn't the claim that it was the sparking that started the fires?
it doesn't take much wind to make wires sway and strike each other.
idk, i haven't really followed it since, but it would seem like it would be alot more common if 30mph winds caused that.
ordinarily, wires are covered in insulation or are regularly repaired to prevent them from sagging and causing this exact thing.
i wouldn't expect the author company of "burn, baby, burn" to care much about it, though.
&gt;it's hard to believe those fires were started by pg&amp;e power lines being knocked down.
why?
they have a poor record in terms of maintaining their power lines.
even if they did get blown down, i imagine they'll have to prove negligence.
edison has a far better track record than pg&amp;e does.
that's what the stock drop is about.
although corporations are people, my friend, they'll never get the death penalty.
like the lowliest of us real people.
so ktla just couldn't resist putting 'spark' in the title.
well done.
perfect safety or affordable electricity.
choose one.
or in the case of sce, neither.
they are a shitty company.
my brother is a currently a 3rd party welding inspector for their gas lines.
they were doing the wrong weld on some pipe and my brother pointed it out to a socal gas supervisor and told him that he couldn't sign-off on the welds.
the supervisor told him that if he wouldn't sign-off on the welds, they would find someone who will.
my brother didn't want to lose his $75/hr job, so he capitulated.
i told him that he is a greedy fucking republican with no morals ethics or values and he should have gone to the press, and still should.
he doesn't care, he wants the money.
hey guys, look at this moron!
he plays identity politics, point at him and laugh.
utility companies should not be allowed to be for-profit.
isps should be utility companies.
probably would be wise to spend a few million to actually do something about it, rather than sustain losses of 3 billion.
why didn't local authorities get involved before this happened?
probably busy busting pot smokers and speeders.
there is a special place in hell for these parents
if it's so smart, why does it think i want to buy stuff i just bought???
mankind is constantly warned of this great danger but continue to pursue it.
were all going to be destroyed by the complacent curiosity of scientists.
the biggest threat to national security.
ever have time and want a good read i'd suggest reading the dune series.
it's funny to me because they've outlawed "thinking machines" due to them nearly wiping out mankind.
but to deny such research would be a burdensome denial of freedom.
the research is also easy enough to perform that it would be difficult to regulate.
it will be interesting to see where the world goes as power becomes even cheaper and easier to wield.
i do not look forward to the destruction of mankind.
that's not really how computer science works.
it does, eventually these computers will get sick of us and riot.
actually... as someone who studies computer science: no.
you're just spouting off feel good fiction that has no basis in reality.
we are a long ways from having computers that can feel anger or desire vengeance and even further from the computers having the capabilities to bypass their constraints.
computer science isn't this fairy tail where you tell a computer to do one thing and it does another.
it's just not how programming or ai works.
thank you.
finally a bit of rational sense explained.
&gt;computer science isn't this fairy tail where you tell a computer to do one thing and it does another.
for someone who "studies computer science" you don't seem to have a very good grasp of what these machines are doing.
they're being given goals, and a mechanism to learn to achieve them, not being instructed directly how to get from point a to point b. when you turn machine learning on, you're not "telling" computer how to achieve it's task.
if you knew what the best way was, you wouldn't be building a learning computer to help you figure it out.
and the fact computers don't "feel" anything is probably their most dangerous trait.
they're not going to share our value systems in anyway, so there's no expectation that they're going to act human.
&gt; for someone who "studies computer science" you don't seem to have a very good grasp i actually have a reasonable grasp of the methodologies.
i don't care to learn **all** the maths involved but when you get down to it the statistics involved become rather mundane.
the weights the biases the adjustments thereof... even the calculus that gets thrown in to optimize process is rather mundane when you break it down to its components.
i'm certainly not qualified to lecture on the topic but there are plenty of resources around if you are interested: https://codeahoy.com/2017/07/28/ai-is-not-magic-how-neural-networks-learn/ a robot might be able to pick your face out of a crowd but it is very far from usurping control of its parameters and acting in an exotic way as to harm specified humans.
silence him!
he’s discovered our plan to serve the computer overlords!
same.
i wish we would embark on our major projects now, such as getting people to mars, before any windows close.
maybe transhumanism can save us.
the ais rise and we go along with them since they've been fundementally woven into our very being.
any advancement in robotics also being an advancement in our own bionic design.
forget skynet.
we need to worry about the all knowing google ai from waking up.
they have already created ais capable of teaching itself and another able to write ai code better than people can.
all they need is for an ai to teach itself to code better than a human and we've officially hit singularity.
we won't though.
the ai will be locked into the parameters and morality of that one single code.
ai is not going to be given free reins on this, that's what the marketers of watson and so forth will continue to espouse, so as to sell the blooming software and hardware.
we've a long way to go yet, and ai will be kept firmly on a leash.
i understand how easy it is to believe this, and i believe it not sinking ago until i embarked on a computer science course to which there are multiples of codes out there.
even web design now there's not a single language for coding because you can encapsulate everything within the parameters of another code.
don't code my site with html or php or javascript or do i go the whole hot and design a whole online programme.
we're far from the singularity, very far from it.
it's fucking chess.
okay now solve p vs np problems mr. superhuman computer ai
so hamas violated the reconciliation deal, then?
i thought that hamas agreed to cease all attacks against israel after signing the reconciliation agreement with the palestinian authority.
does that deal only start at a certain date or is it currently in effect?
not after yesterday and the palestinians calling for days of anger.
they are seriously upset the embassy was moved.
and they are apparently willing to throw more away for nothing i don't believe the embassy is moving yet.
if i recall the last article i read, trump signed a waiver which pushes off the move for another nine months.
during that time, they will scout locations, figure out a security plan, and begin building the new embassy.
ok, obviously it wasn't moved overnight, it's not like we were fleeing the country... but the issue still stands regardless if it happens now or in four years from now.
isreal and jerusalem were recognized and that pissed of the palestinians even though this isn't really anything new that’s why i don’t care when the idf curb stomps them.
that's just a savage mindset.
i support israel but i don't ignore inhumanity when it happens.
they shouldn’t have voted for hamas if they don’t like it... and then trump recognized jerusalem as israel's capital.
what do you think is going to happen in the area, everlasting peace?
it's going to escalate again.
&gt;recognized jerusalem as israel's capital wasn't that done in 1995?
and ordered the u.s. embassy to move there, to boot.
one thing has nothing to do with the other.
hamas signed the reconciliation deal to reconcile with the palestinian authority.
the document doesn't stated that it's voided if jerusalem is declared israeli.
that's attaching conditions that don't exist.
their agreement is with the palestinian authorities who as of yesterday declared that friday will be the first day of a new intifada.
hamas probably figures no-one cares to stop them anymore.
unsurprisingly, people get upset and lob katyushas at you when the united states unilaterally hands ownership of land that a lot of people have historical claim to to a state that hasn't existed for 70 years.
i'm also totaly sure that this will end with israel recognizing that other people might have a claim to the most sanctified land in the world and with people who think the arab world might have half a point not being called anti-semites.
"some moronic fuckwit from a different continent made a stupid decision that has no practical effect on jack shit.
we better fire unguided rockets at a population center in response!"
- other moronic fuckwits, probably ha!
such a bunch of jerkoffs....oh well....back to smackin them around i guess.
carve them a new asshole!
this very very very sad just as trump wanted.
a start of another war in the middle east.
you can always count on the little to non existant self control of these people.
i imagine he has companies or shares in companies that will supply bedding, magazines, mres, face scarves, bullets, etc.. no one could be this stupid as to make the declaration trump did without being positioned to make money.
i’m sure they appreciate the coordinates.
“aim farther next time”
i would like to see what the suspect ended up looking like and how closely it matches the "sketch."
https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2017/11/18/screen_shot_2017-11-18_at_16.26.07_c0-0-824-481_s885x516.png?d90833d45d0923d8eee3653bae0892585d16556b yep, that's a white guy alright.
better give myself up!
how the hell did they decided what his hairstyle is?
he's a white guy.
there's like, three, tops.
3 styles?
haha.
funny joke.
but, i'm curious why a mock up would have styled hair.
why not use generic long, medium, short modifiers.
wouldn't using such a specific style on a mock up be more of a hindrance?
my guess is that the police were clutching at straws and they knew it, or the company behind the phenotyping is trying to make their results look more impressive than they really are (they basically amount to hair colour, eye colour, and maybe a rough guess at face shape).
this is utter hogwash.
current widely accepted forensic science is questionable at best.
the error on this thing must be through the roof.
you're not supposed to use junk science as evidence (they do), but you are fully allowed to use it (and any other form of lie) to coerce someone to confess.
oh you can fuck right the fuck off.
the more and more we learn about epigenetic influences on phenotypic expression the more we learn that dna phenotyping is complete bullshit.
forensic science is basically a long string of pseudoscience that they peddle to cops who don’t know any better.
it worked with the polygraph test, it’ll work with this as well.
"they asked me if i had a degree in forensic science.
i told them i had a pseudodegree in forensic science and they said welcome aboard."
can confirm.
worked as a forensic psuedoscientist until i got a big boy job.
i tried to suggest this, and asked how true was this on another thread and was berated for “not believing in dna and science” like i have an engineering degree fuck right off everyone saying the "sketch" looks just like the guy.
it doesn't look like him at all.
probably because they can only make a wild guess on just eye, hair and skin color but the face is just the white guy "template".
they can't guess what someones lips might look like or what their face structure might look like.
i have seen some police sketches from when i was in my csi program that were incredibly close, but you are right, this is no where near as close.
the nose is very different; the suspect's nostrils are wider than the sketch.
they did get the suspect's jawline almost, however it's a bit more pointed at the sides than the sketch.
his lips are also not right in the sketch; the corners of his mouth are pointed upward whereas the sketch's lips are flat all around.
his ears even look off.
i'm glad the guy came forward but if i had known the guy and seen that sketch, i would have never guessed it was him because it's not him.
it may certainly look like someone out there in the world but in itself is problematic as it could have caused people to point fingers at the wrong person and prolonged the search for the right person.
it looks like the suspect has had at least one broken nose, but the overall face shape is the same.
would need to see a decent sample of what the computer thinks and compare them to the actual individuals sampled to see how far off the generated portraits are.
i hope it’s not possible.
here’s their website: https://snapshot.parabon-nanolabs.com i like how most of the examples represent the same hair length of the suspect at the time of booking.
a few others look nothing like the detained suspect.
i worry about people like myself who purchased the ancestry dna whose t&amp;c's list a stipulation that acenstry dna has full ownership rights of your dna sample.
for what i got out of ancestry dna, it's not worth the risk that one day it becomes legal for some f.b.i.
agent might subpeona my dna sample for a composite image such as this.
not even close, unless all white people look alike to you.
they have been able to do this for several years now and most people didn't know.
not a dead ringer but pretty darn close.
https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/nov/18/ryan-riggs-texas-man-confesses-murder-dna-image/ holy shit.
ops article doesn't show the suspect.
that is a disturbingly good rendition of the kid.
really?
disturbingly good?
same hair and skin and eye color.
and the same nose, and the hair type.
it's more accurate than many witness sketches.
i've done professional portraits and that is *not* the same nose.
that suspect looks like he's had a couple of broken noses.
what?
it looks nothing like him
&gt; then “today” co-host meredith vieira was especially crude, making jokes about lauer and roker partaking in anal sex during the turin olympics, with roker as the receiving partner.
lmao.
&gt; but the most cringeworthy comments, in hindsight, were made by lauer himself, who spoke at the end of the roast.
the “today” star alluded to sex with two former colleagues, couric and curry.
&gt;“let me just say that i saw that colon a lot before the rest of you saw it,” lauer said in an anal sex joke about couric (who famously underwent a colonoscopy on air).
holy shit.
i'm dead.
i have an abnormally high disdain for these morning shows.
the combination of reporting absolutely nothing of substance and the uner fake sunny attitudes makes it really hard to digest.
the fact that these guys joke around like frat boys and then go on camera and act like mormons having the best day of their life feels really gross.
you'd hate family home evening.
and early morning seminary teachers youth conference testimony meetings &gt; mormons having the best day of their life so like, their wedding day, after the reception is finally over and they get to have sex after 22 long years of feeling guilty for masturbation?
i've always wondered who watches these morning shows.
most of us are scrambling around to get out and on the road.
stay home moms?
they are even busier pushing around bunch of school aged kids to get up, wash up, eat breakfast and get to school.
so really, who watches these shows?
it's mostly stay at home moms.
or retired partners who are supposed to have the laundry and lunches made by 5:30. tom!
good to know their minds are being turned into mush by these things.
you sound like them describing video games.
my mom used to have it on in the background while getting ready for work in the morning.
my mom turns it on the morning while she gets ready or while she's doing puzzles on her ipad or something.
they suck but i prefer it to the endless home improvement shows she seems to watch.
charlie rose bullshit aside, cbs this morning has been solidly really good with its focus on actual news.
today was the #1 rated morning news program so somebody's watchin sounds like a good time to me.
sure it looks bad in retro but i love working somewhere where i am free to be this open and crude at times.
now i just have to make sure i never harass someone and have to try and explain jokes i cracked 10 years prior.
&gt;now i just have to make i never harass someone and have to try and explain jokes i cracked 10 years prior.
we are all.screwed if people look back at jokes we made 10 years ago.
i don't think anyone will run for office 50 years from now.
"your political stance is impressive, but what do you have to say about this facebook post you made when you were 14?"
or they'll be super mormons i've actually been thinking about this a lot.
i used to work in an office with 2 women who loved to tell dirty jokes.
they would force us to relive all of their sexual exploits, drag us to strip clubs, and have contests to find the raunchiest porn.
a buddy ex-coworker of mine ran into one of them a while back and the craziness came up.
she was in total denial, and claimed that she was upset at the atmosphere that we created.
she was the instigator of everything.
now she wants a reckoning.
it's a crazy time we are entering.
yeah same.
one coworker at a former job of mine had a guy fired for sending her creepy messages on facebook.
couple days later i walk up into a conversation with her and another female worker talking about whos hot, who theyd fuck, ect.
to be fair us dudes were saying the same about them, but we didnt send creepy messages so no one gave a shit.
"oh wow, isn't it amazing how people have such awful memories?
they can't remember how things happened at all.
fortunately i remember exactly how it really happened."
just keep it in mind.
i worked with a woman who would regularly don a pair of costume devil horns and dance around saying "i'm horny, i'm horny", and we were all supposed to laugh.
it was appalling.
this is why the culture changed, it reached peak lunacy.
women were disparaging themselves because they couldn't tell a proper joke like guys.
try 5 years.
am i supposed to be outraged at this, seems like co workers joking about each other.
i don't know why the world (and reddit) is shocked about these types of revelations.
people get old and gain life experience.
do people think 60 year old women and men get to be 60+ years old and haven't had sex, threesomes, one nighters, drunken stupid decisions, and other sexcapades?
humans aren't innocent.
it's not like they say that shit on live tv.
people have personal lives.
people have weird fetishes or things that they're crazy about with sex.
these are also people who lived in a time when you could do/say something without 20 people recording it and "snapchatting" it for the nosy fucking world to see.
harassment and inappropriate humor have been around since apes branched off into fucking humans.
i don't see us stopping it now.
just don't go overboard and psycho about it.
punish the rapists like harvey.
don't crucify people who you think are supposed to be stepford wives and christian gentlemen.
&gt;harassment and inappropriate humor ...are *completely* different from each other.
full stop.
i am in my early 60s and definitely have had my share of intimate moments, but they have all been with willing partners and i have never made crude jokes about them.
you have never made a crude sex joke?
not really - certainly not about anyone i know.
i must admit that there seems to be a lot of opportunity for "that's what she said" comments though.
i member the rumors were for years that him and couric were an item she sounds like a bit of a pocket rocket.
i can imagine she's wild in bed the part with tom cruise was interesting.
i was surprised that he showed up to roast lauer given their feud at the time.
scientology will do anything to stay relevant and in (bed) with the media.
cruise gets the most leeway in terms of hanging out with ppl who might be hostile to scientology.
given the concentration of media execs at this thing, the scientos were probably spying harder than the village voice.
interesting that tony ortega was the writer.
he is now famously working with former members to publicize the dark side of the church on [his website the underground bunker.

&gt;comedian gilbert gottfried was so obscene that fox news can’t even publish a highly expurgated version of his material, but part of his racist routine – filled with asian sex jokes about ann curry –included detailed remarks about curry’s genitals.
somebody file a freedom of information claim &gt; gilbert gottfried was so obscene that fox news can’t even publish a highly expurgated version of his material if you are surprised by this, you’ve never seen gottfried at a roast.
there are no holds barred he made a joke at the hefner roast about being late because his flight had a connection with the empire state building, this was 3 weeks after 9/11.
he also made a joke to pete davidson about his dad being ashy his dad died as a firefighter on 9/11 this cost him his gig as the voice of the aflac duck he lost his aflac gig for tweeting jokes about the japanese tsunami like as it was happening.
the jokes were pretty funny at least.
yeah, something about japanese men not being depressed after being dumped by their girlfriends because new one would float by any minute.
which i'm not ok with.
i loved him as that duck he was a good duck isn't there a documentary being released on him?
i'm going to shoot some of you white motherfuckers and rape some of you white bitches - gilbert gottfried his "the aristocrats" was classic.
right up there with chaplain's greatest moments.
"i didn't know that could be an art, but he just invented, defined, and perfected it, all in one go."
i still think that stanhope's version is the best one.
when he was on the norm macdonald show and they riffed for like an hour about how the co host ate out hitler’s asshole.
fucking hilarious.
did you at least think about bringing them to justice, afterwards?
as is tradition for a roast.
nor holes, apparently bet he said it was sideways.
that's the usual go to joke.
&gt;http://snltranscripts.jt.org/00/00ptoughguy.phtml snl did it in 2001, too.
s26e16, april 7th.
&gt;now, i don't pretend to know who these chinese people are - i know they're small, maybe 1 or 2 feet high!
i know they sound funny when they talk, i know the womenfolk have sideways vaginas 's a popular joke, it seems.
that joke was old when i was a kid (back in the 70s).
it probably dates back to wwi or earlier.
i have no idea what this joke is supposed to mean... it's a reference to asian eyes me too.
i have lived in east asia for 20 years, and thought i'd heard all the racist tropes, but... that one, no.
ive almost only heard it from military guys that were stationed in vietnam or philipines except an old mexican told me about it recently, so its gotten around for a while the one i remember as a kid was something like - "q: what sound does an [insert asian country] girl make going down a slide?
a: *makes motorboat sound with finger over lips*" here you go man, its filthy.
https://www.villagevoice.com/2008/10/24/matt-lauers-roast-tom-cruise-katie-couric-and-3-hours-of-dick-jokes/ wow.
2008 is centuries away from 2017 in terms of culture isn’t it.
it works both ways.
some stuff was acceptable back then not today and vice versa.
that was fucking beautiful.
holy fuck.
are we seriously starting witch hunts over comedy routines now?
do people not see how puritanical and authoritarian this is becoming at an alarming speed?
i mean i was joking.
i don’t really care.
but from a liability standpoint we should all stop talking to each other.
i'm alleging harassment at you!
doesn't work for private companies.
it was just a joke.
locker room talk &gt;somebody file a freedom of information claim.
so do it.
&gt; somebody file a freedom of information claim sadly, this only works with the government.
holy shit i forgot about ann curry.
i swear i saw that woman more than my own mother.
isn't gilbert asian himself.
might just have skinny eyes.
but he can't be racist against asians if he's asian.
like black people can say the horrible n word.
precedence set.
just turn on howard stern.
you'll figure it out.
&gt;but a shot at lauer’s in-office relationship with curry, who was in the room, got the biggest laugh of couric’s routine.
&gt;“no.
2 - he loves to eat curry,” she said as curry (sitting in the audience) went pale and the crowd roared with laughter.
“what?
indian food!
what’s wrong with you people?” katie couric can do standup.
who knew?
meh, it was a little obvious.
and if curry had not publicly acknowledged the relationship prior to this joke, that's kind of super-uncool of couric.
edit because i thought about the joke some more and read up on lauer and curry's relationship: if couric said that joke then she is the worst.
so lauer and curry apparently clearly never liked each other (i didnt know, dont watch morning news).
however, couric and lauer worked well together.
so at an event designed to consensually mock lauer, couric made jokes implying curry slept with a man she publicly disliked to get her job.
lauer wasn't the butt of that joke, curry was.
it cast her as a woman that slept her way up the corporate ladder, as well as implying she let a man she hated sleep with her.
that is such a gross move.
that is so gross.
poor ann.
it was a roast.
roasts are raunchy, nasty affairs.
if you don’t want to be the butt if a joke, don’t show up.
rules of the roast are there are no rules.
no subject is off limits, no person is sacred.
the rules of normal etiquette and discourse do not apply and nothing should be taken seriously.
the slightest personal flaws are exaggerated for comic effect.
this would have been better to watch than half the comedy central roasts.
if you want a see a good roast look up the roast of patrice o'neal.
the comics just tear into each other and it's great.
i listen to it more than most stand up specials.
patrice was truly a legend.
i remember listening to opie and anthony the day after he died and they had all his comedian friends in the studio and all they did was roast each other for hours.
they said it's what he would have wanted.
that louis ck roast of the way bobby kelly talks is one of the funniest things i've ever heard.
especially when bobby calls in and is just fucking furious.
man, i wish that era didn't end.
me too, i used to look forward to my commute when those guys were in studio.
or worse, the howard stern “roasts” which are garbage shit shows.
makes you wonder who else out there “everyone” knows about but aren’t mentioning.
whoever has a door lock button under their desks.
i mean, some of the stuff, like louis ck, i'm like "okay, i mean, at least he asked, even if it wasn't a fair situation for these women."
at what point can you get a door-lock button installed on your desk and think it's okay?
how do you even explain it to the install guy?
lol actually, from what i've read the door-lock button is not that unusual in high-end executive offices.
it's so they can lock the door and get some respite from the constant intrusions, without having to get up and do it themselves.
it's intended purpose isn't to function as a rape-trap.
in access control, doors should always allow free egress.
a lock on the door is fine so long as you can still open the door while in the room.
having a button to hit under a desk to allow exit isn't cool.
no idea how this was set up, but sounds suspect.
oh, no doubt it’s against building code.
i’m just saying it wasn’t uncommon, and the purpose wasn’t to enable rape.
&gt; how do you even explain it to the install guy?
"i'd like to be able to lock the door without getting up from my desk".
pretty reasonable.
“i don’t want the interior door handle to work though, just this hidden button” sounds worse.
"and about the trap door..." "muffle the sounds coming from this room..." &gt; how do you even explain it to the install guy "i'm worried about terrorists or some armed nut coming into the building, i'd like to be able to lock my office door instantly, without having to get up or even move an inch.
what do you recommend?"
there you go.
seems pretty easy to explain.
and the reason why, when you do it, the door handle doesn't work?
“oh, also creepy sex dungeon.” ask.matt lauer as a security measure if some nutjob with a gun got into the office.
the problem arises when the door is locked both from the outside **and** the inside.
most people have to submit requisition forms in triplicate to get a new pencil sharpener, but somehow lauer gets a fancy door-locking-button installed in his desk.
jerry seinfeld.
donald trump?
i mean, we rewarded his behavior.
it seems clear we have an endemic problem in this country in regards to sexual misconduct.
it seems to traverse state, local, and party lines.
yet we do nothing about it even when our elected officials are part of the problem.
the thing is, it's only recently that it's started to seem like a problem.
we're undergoing a cultural shift right now (by "right now" i mean in the last decade or so).
thirty years ago, this was just "men behaving like men" sort of stuff.
sixty years ago it didn't even raise an eyebrow, and was just how the world worked.
i think it’s pretty clear trump’s *not* someone everyone knows about but no one’s mentioning like lauer, weinstein, conley, bush sr, etc.
there is a chunk of this nation so large that hates trump if there were any actual sexual assault charges to be known they would be known.
[here's a list](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/11/what-happened-to-trumps-16-sexual-misconduct-accusers.html) many of these came out decades before he ever ran for president.
&gt;in 1997 harth and houraney sued trump for breach of contract, and she filed a separate sexual-harassment suit, accusing him of “attempted rape.” they reached a confidential settlement in the contract suit, and as part of the agreement harth withdrew her suit.
convincing someone to accuse him of attempted rape in 1997 in order to sabotage him in 2017 is **true** 4d chess.
&gt;the allegation: the journalist claimed that trump pushed her against a wall and forced his tongue down her throat while giving her a tour of mar-a-lago.
stoynoff was working on a profile of the trumps, and said that while waiting for melania to arrive for an interview, donald told her, “you know we’re going to have an affair, don’t you?” &gt;she said he also referenced a new york post cover published during his affair with marla maples.
“you remember,” he said.
“‘best sex i ever had.’” he's a real quality act, indeed.
this was okay in the 90s.
[tfw there's a whole wikipedia page about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/donald_trump_sexual_misconduct_allegations) the same people that hid lauer and weinstein have been calling trump a sexist rapist every single day.
you'd have to be an insane partisan hack to try and deflect blame off the enablers of those men onto trump.
and trump also supported a pedophile in alabama.
funny how that works out.
&gt; you'd have to be an insane partisan hack to try and deflect blame off the enablers of those men onto trump.
wait, why are you trying to deflect blame from those men onto some mysterious "enablers" here?
nor was anybody -- even for a second -- *blaming* trump.
you're just trying to be a victim here.
poor trump!
the world is so mean to him!!!
edit: figured the first part out.
if it's the fault of these "enablers," then it's really the fault of the eeeeeeevil liberal meeeeeedia instead of just lauer being an shithead.
i condemn all of them for their blatant disregard for, and active oppression of, the basic human right we all have to not be groped, molested or assaulted.
we all should be able to decide who does and who does not get to put their hands on us.
i hope justice is served on anyone who violates another person in these ways.
trump could sexually assault someone on live television and his supporters would blame hillary clinton\obama\george soros\jews he could shoot someone, and still support him.
he's really the only thing america got going for it after liberals ruined it.
like that iraqi said last year, saddam killed my whole family but i still supported him and wish he was still president.
probably the victims should talk to the police if they want to tackle such a big fish.
it's hard for a verbal accusation during an election to hold much merit on its own.
it’s a fucking roast.
you’re allowed to let go and make lewd jokes.
&gt; you're allowed to let go and make lewd jokes.
i thought it was frowned upon to _not_ tell lewd jokes at roasts.
&gt;i thought it was frowned upon to not tell lewd jokes at roasts.
hence the brilliance of norm macdonald.
https://streamable.com/yg6ut anyone who hasn't seen this ought too.
comedians were encouraged to be as filthy as possible.
norm doesn't take direction well.
one of the best bombing sets i've seen.
fuckin norm.
he did a set of nothing but dad jokes.
i fucking love it.
it's fox news reporting.
they're hoping people don't make the connection with how matt lauer got fired for his crimes as where fox news just tried to quiet down people that accused bill o'reilly of his crimes.
after reading the jokes that were made, i think this is a stretch.
it looks like they make as many gay jokes as office jokes and theres been nothing about matt lauer being secretly gay.
im sure they all knew, and this behavior has been referenced by others in the past, but a comedic roast full of raunchy jokes doesnt really prove anything other than they all lack imagination.
for all that is secret will eventually be brought into the open, and everything that is concealed will be brought to light and made known to all.
hail jeebus.
so these people were willing participants in the jokes and were vilifying them for it?
yeah, i didn't see anything wrong with this.
consenting adults gathered privately to make crude jokes about each other.
so?
they're villifying the execs who are saying, "we had no idea matt was a horn-dog perving on all the women in the office!"
meanwhile they attended, and in some cases participated in, a roast that was all about horn-dog matt and his pervy office escapades.
you seem trustworthy, guy with random string of numbers username who mostly talks about politics everybody is russian except you.
anyway, what do you think i should order for dinner?
i've been eating junk all week, and i'm fed up of everything around me.
*we* aren't vilifying them for it.
fox news is...the same organization that covered this kind of stuff up for decades with ailes and o'reilly.
don't forget to look at what outlet is reporting this... "media elites" is a very specific, loaded choice of words i felt so bad for ann curry.
i'm shocked at meredith vieira!
i'm having a shocked captain renault moment here.
i'm coming around to the conclusion that this behaviour was common, and acceptable at the time it occurred this just shows that he was known as a manwhore, something completely different than rapist.
i don't know about you guys but i've been getting quite a thrill out of this.
i've always disliked matt lauer for some reason.. and now i know why... any guy that would drive a bus over his wife and kids **so he get his dick wet** is a fucking loser.
the guy has always come off to me as being really sleazy and full of himself.
while there have been some accusations against people that i found shocking, when i first heard the news about lauer i just thought "yeah, that sounds about right".
i wasn't surprised that he turned out to be the kind of dude to sexually harass his coworkers at all.
itt: people who don't know what a roast is haven't seen fox news on here in a while no, this story is bullshit.
friar’s club roasts are notoriously dirty, and reference little ducks, not satisfying wives, gay sex with close friends, and general vulgarity.
no matter who was being roasted, jokes like that were going to be made.
so joking about him eating (ann) curry?
that doesn’t signal anything at all.
now, if there were jokes about him chasing interns or locking his door?
that would tell me that they knew.
but the jokes in this article were positively generic: lauer is gay and can’t satisfy his wife, bryant gumble is white, al roker is black and fat, the women are promiscuous.
these are the absolute most generic roast jokes imaginable.
i’m not saying no one knew—-i don’t know who knew what.
but this article describes a roast that is in every way the same thing that’d be said about any dude, unless they dude is a known prude like pence or romney, in which case the jokes will be about fear of sex and closeted gayness.
i don’t give a damn about lauer or nbc execs, but i hate this kind of journalism, that is pretending to have uncovered some elite conspiracy when in reality, a roast is a bunch of lewd jokes that are outrageous on purpose and need have no truth to them.
its a post-joke world didnt yah know.
it's a post-joke world they themselves created.
now they get to wallow in their own mess.
all the things coming out now are probably just the tip of the iceberg.
what a deliberately obnoxious fox news title.
i do have a good laugh anytime one of these people's colleagues get on camera or in the papers and try to tell us with a straight face that they had no idea this was going on.
lauer's colleagues deserve acting awards for the performance they put on the morning he was fired.
i am excited to see bill o'rileys response...haven't see him in a while....what's he up too?
i love when the liberal elites and their media puppets preach about women's rights and sexual assault..... and then get caught with their hands up someone's skirt.
i'm surprised this news outfit leaked trumps "grab them by the pussy" audio bit without just once looking into the mirror and seeing the irony in them calling out trump over *his* behavior (and no, i do not endorse trumps comment one bit either).
it's just funny to me; "omg did you hear what trump said??
unbelievable!"
vs. "everyone knows lauer likes to eat curry!"
and *everyone* just laughs in her face yeah, it's clearly not an issue limited to one political group or nationality.
any attempt to frame it like that is unacceptable.
however, there is an enormous difference between a media darling being a secret monster and the leader of the free world being a public monster.
it's the difference between "this is bad" and "holy crap, things are this bad?!"
tbf, no media figures would have lost their jobs had they not branded trump's behavior as the epitome of abuse of women.
and now, media figures have disproportionately been affected by the ongoing scandals.
ironic.
true.
trump's presidency definitely has helped stoke public concern over our culture's weirdly condoning behavior towards sexual predation.
hopefully this movement neither quickly dies or escalates to a point that baseless accusations carry immediate repercussions beyond the unavoidable.
not to mention a huge difference between lauer's bosses finding out about serious allegations and immediately firing him, and the republican public hearing donald trump on tape admitting to serious sexual predation and them still elect him anyway.
"immediately" firing him 10 years after an entire room of people apparently publicly roasted him over it.
not sure how immediate you can call that, unless some how everyone but his bosses knew about it back in 2008. it's more like the immediately fired him once the public became outraged and they had to for pr purposes.
a joke at a roast is not a serious allegation.
unless, of course, you are saying that the jokes at donald trump's roast should be treated that way.
are you?
because there were jokes about him raping his wife and fucking his daughter in there.
comedy, especially roasts, often contain elements of truth.
you think it is just a coincidence that multiple people at that event made jokes about his treatment of women?
look at the other roasts and what the over all theme of those roasts were, they're commonly based on truthful aspects of the guest of honor's life.
trump raping his ex (which she accused him of), hasselhoff's alcohol issues, pam's sex tape, leary stealing jokes... if you think the entertainment industry got together and collectively roasted this guy over his womanizing, yet no one knew or suspected he was actually doing it, i have a bridge to sell you.
&gt;comedy, especially roasts, often contain elements of truth.
then from the article: &gt;then “today” co-host meredith vieira was especially crude, making jokes about lauer and roker partaking in anal sex during the turin olympics, with roker as the receiving partner.
matt lauer was fucking al roker in the ass?!
&gt; comedy, especially roasts, often contain elements of truth.
not even close to true &gt; lauer's bosses finding out about serious allegations and immediately firing him yes, they totally just recently found out about them.
/s not everyone that has been accused is a monster.
i could not care less that dustin hoffman grabbed someone's bottom, or jeffrey tambor made a scandalous proposition.
this exactly.
regardless of political preference, american society is changing before our eyes.
[deleted] and yet the media loves to lecture us about how bad trump is... projection, mayhaps?
that's dumb.
this behavior is wrong no matter where it occurs.
more like hypocrisy and propaganda.
it's like how whoopi defends child rapists like roman polanski and serial rapists like bill cosby while attacking trump for his silly comments.
it's like how the media joked about "slick willy" raping/molesting interns at the oval office while slamming trump for his silly comments.
funny how jfk kept a stable of teenagers as his prostitutes and the media invented the bullshit about "camelot".
it's almost like the idiots running news organizations are biased agenda driven propagandists.
and fox news proceeds to be offended by celebrity roasts.
honestly folks, i realize this is "low hanging fruit", but it's not especially interesting.
so did any actual harassment take place here?
&gt; pfizer inc. will begin selling the white pill at half the $65-a-pill retail price on monday, when its patent-protected monopoly ends.
generic maker teva pharmaceuticals can start selling its version then, but isn’t disclosing the price.
o so back to 2013 prices of the drug?
32 dollars per boner still sounds steep as fuck.
wait till you're in your 70s, my boy.
back in my day we had to shove a wasp up our urethra to get an erection.
and we liked it!
there has to be a huge market for fake viagra.
i can get fake xanax literally anywhere and it still has the real ingredients, i would hope the same is happening with viagra lol it is.
there's fake cialis and levitra too, and even combos.
it's 1/10th the price and works just as well.
i heard.
i hard yep.
most of the good stuff comes from india.
have you ever looked in your spam folder?
there is you can literally purchase online from india, and have it mailed to your house for the low low price of $0.36 a pill it is fun to see the number of fda warnings sent to nutraceutical manufacturers whose products are “contaminated” with viagra.
ever been to mexico?
we were hounded by hawkers at the tourist attractions - "viagra!
viagra!"
they would shout at my girlfriend.
she spoke fluent spanish and responded "no necesito!"
and i would strut by smugly.
lol &gt; there has to be a huge market for fake viagra.
i can get fake xanax literally anywhere and it still has the real ingredients, i would hope the same is happening with viagra lol that's considered generic, not fake.
fake would be something that doesn't work at all.
well by fake i meant it's pressed on the streets by "drug dealers" rather than legally produced.
obviously a health concern tho i think you mean off brand.
outside of the us you can get generic viagra for about $1 per pill, sold in packs of 4. or actually even lower than that.
a pack of 12 of 100mg generic sits here at around 5€ i forgot where i read this recently,but one country in europe is about to otc viagra.
as they should.
we just walk into a pharmacy and buy it here too, it’s nice.
trust me, the shit is epic.
the smurf vision sucked but the hardons?
goddamn do they go for hours!!!
over and over too, with quick reset times.
i used to have a sex addict gf that would get one for me when she got her party drugs.
better put a rubber on it.
else it ends up being a million dollar boner &gt; 32 dollars per boner still sounds steep as fuck.
how many times are you going to be fucking if you're an old man?
once a month?
and back to 2013 profitability.
big issue in the board room.
you can only renew your patent so many times before it goes generic.
unfortunately, they were unable to find "something" that would force them to re-patent.
unlike, albuterol http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/us/the-soaring-cost-of-a-simple-breath.html?pagewanted=all but even if they can change it a bit, the original formula can still be produced by anyone else.
but you can just market the new version to idiot consumers as 'superior', send a few thousand urologists to 'speaking conferences' where they're paid to have lunch and commence a 2 week vacation, so they'll prescribe it.
bada bing bada boom, billions in profit and higher insurance costs for everyone!
this is actually how it happens and has been happening for decades.
&gt; this is actually how it happens and has been happening for decades.
that ended circa 2009ish.
great for society, bummer for surgical subspecialists.
the evidence was undeniable, though, that even a goddamn pen influences prescribing behavior, so "speaking events" in hawaii were just too obvious a conflict.
the sunshine act helped but it still does happen &gt;big issue in the board room.
that sounds like a euphemism for "can't get boners" that you'd hear in a viagra commercial.
really?
pfizer is selling both the original and the generic.
that drug has been all profit for years.
now people will buy more because of the price drop thinking they are getting a good deal on the generic.
but pfizer has been slowly raising the price for years in anticipation of the generic rollout.
but many people will also still insist on buying the identical name brand at the much higher cost.
pfizer knows what it's doing.
...viagra is $65 fucking dollars a pill?
here it is $74.
you have to go to canada/elsewhere to get them.
stiff prices that makes me giggle.
in the uk we sell them off private prescriptions for the generic version for about £1/tablet.
and they've announced that pharmacies will soon be able to sell it without a prescription.
i guess that's what happens when you apply a capitalist ethos to healthcare.
&gt; i guess that's what happens when you apply a capitalist ethos to healthcare.
it says something that the capitalist company was the one that came up with the med in the first place.
considering us does 95%+ of the medical research in the world, none of these countries would have these medicines to begin with.
viagra was produced by researchers in england.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sildenafil#history &gt;sildenafil (compound uk-92,480) was synthesized by a group of pharmaceutical chemists working at pfizer's sandwich, kent, research facility in england.
it was initially studied for use in hypertension (high blood pressure) and angina pectoris (a symptom of ischaemic heart disease).
the first clinical trials were conducted in morriston hospital in swansea.
[40] phase i clinical trials under the direction of ian osterloh suggested the drug had little effect on angina, but it could induce marked penile erections.
can confirm.
i know a phd who was there at the time.
by his account they were very excited at the discovery.
&gt; they were very excited at the discovery aroused even they didn’t do it for the uk money... &gt; viagra was produced by researchers in england.
i mean shit id need a few of them pills myself to get it up with a british girl.
even your royalty is hotepping over to the winning side.
that is to say my man, the black side.
honestly how yall managed to reproduce on that tiny ass island for thousands of generations is just beyond me.
if i were a norman invader id look at those razor-toothed land whales and take my skinny invading ass back to omaha.
i mean really, anyone with a damn noodle coulda told you viagra came from england calm down, kid.
did your mom finally let you use the big boy internet or something?
don't just make up information to support whatever you feel should be true.
not true, from the top 20 pharma companies 10 are in the us: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_largest_pharmaceutical_companies_by_revenue .
why the heck would the us produce 95% of the medical research?
&gt; why the heck would the us produce 95% of the medical research?
to prop up the "we pay more for healthcare because we pay for everyone's research!"
lie.
false information everywhere.
according to tax filings, 0% of research is done in the us.
only ireland, grand came and cyprus.
(i'm only somewhat kidding) &gt; grand came freudian slip in a viagra thread.
that's not true.
https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/01/02/us-medical-research-spending-drops-while-asia-makes-gains anyone praising the way china and company conducts research knows absolutely nothing about how research actually works.
the work coming out of china right now is either stolen, academically weak, or ethically questionable in a way that should make any reasonable person squirm.
the us may be spending a little less but we still lead the globe in quality research, full stop.
but not 95% as was claimed.
period.
while pharmaceutical companies get most of the credit for these discoveries, most of the research for life-saving medication is done by the university system.
this is, unfortunately, going to change significantly with the new tax bill.
once in effect, the new tax bill will raise taxes on the graduate students doing most of this research [by 400%](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/16/house-gop-tax-plan-could-increase-taxes-for-grad-students-by-400-percent.html).
in order to maintain our advantage in pharmaceutical research, universities would have to be willing to significantly increase the amount of grants they provide to these researchers, or they will be forced to leave their labs for other work.
while many of them will be able to move into industry, it should be noted that for-profit pharmaceutical research companies are incentivized towards inventing treatments rather than cures.
you cannot create a customer base with a cure.
within 5 years, we're also going to start seeing problems with finding qualified researchers to do this work.
not only will domestic students find it substantially more difficult to survive the years it takes to earn a graduate degree, we have already started seeing a drop in international students coming to the us as the cultural climate turns increasingly hostile towards foreigners.
it won't be long until our claims of subsidizing the world's pharmaceutical research is just more hot air used to justify the most expensive medical system the world has ever seen.
that isn’t true at all.
it has been a few years since i checked, but the entire nih budget was only 3x that of pfizer’s r&amp;d spend.
yes, how dare graduate students working as researchers pay taxes on what is effectively wages.
if a university's graduate students are doing research, those students should be treated like employees.
this whole system of giving students free tuition and a stipend is just skirting the system.
or we cut these students a small break while they complete the necessary education and training required to become some of the most important pieces of america's continued advanced leadership in technology, science, and medicine.
they're not making exorbitant sums.
it's more like modest housing relatively close to campus and usually with roommates, staple foodstuffs, tuition assistance, and enough extra to see a movie every month or so to keep them from going insane.
&gt; what is effectively wages it's not it is.
it really isn't.
definitely is.
you have a point (though i disagree that education grants should be considered the same as wages), but that doesn't change the fact that we're creating an economical problem with no planned solution.
pricing graduate students out of doing pharmaceutical research is not going to allow us to maintain our dominance in the market.
oh i'm not asking for the university research program to end, only to start acting like it really is: fee for service.
so if grad students are getting priced out, universities should switch to a system that pays their student researchers a salary that the students then pay taxes on.
&gt; fee for service.
if you require universities to hire students researchers as researchers instead of students, where does the money come from to pay them?
subsidies have been cut back by devos and don't look to be returning as long as republicans have control.
if the money is to come from the market, where?
people invest when they believe they'll have a high roi.
researching a cure for a disease that afflicts 10,000 people would have a terrible roi, even if you charged way more than the patients could reasonably be expected to afford.
but a university program can pursue it under a government grant.
and regarding the students themselves, it's not as if it isn't a mutually beneficial situation.
companies that pay good money don't want to spend years training people who can leave whenever they like.
and most of them aren't very good at training anyway.
universities are the only currently feasible way to get the kind of education you need to compete for research jobs, even if they get away with more than we'd like with regard to compensation.
is the solution to regulate how universities handle their student researchers?
or is the solution to dramatically raise the student's taxes and see if the problem fixes itself?
it probably will, but not in favor of the us economy.
shouldn't those students (who are really employees) be given a living wage and full access to health care, dental, vision, etc...?
it's the universities who are mistreating these people.
the government is only now pointing this out by eliminating the loophole these pseudo-corporations have been using to oppress their workers.
oh come on.
all they need to do is create a new regulation to classify student researchers differently.
in fact, that's what they're supposed to do.
sabotaging their tax structure is either greedy or petty.
either way is bad governance.
optionally, the colleges could just restructure the way they gift education.
&gt; shouldn't those students (who are really employees) be given a living wage and full access to health care, dental, vision, etc...?
and how does this change anything about how universities are allowed to treat their student researchers?
the average grad student makes $30,000 (significantly above minimum wage) in addition to their tuition remittance (which i agree is a ridiculous way of handling their accounting).
you are giving them a pretty noble motivation considering that what they did doesn't actually do anything to fix the situation of these students except put both them and their universities into turmoil.
the line i regularly hear for private businesses is that if their business model can't handle paying living wages and benefits to their workers, then they should go out of business.
time for universities to start facing that too, instead of designating everyone "student-(another word for worker)" so they can exploit loopholes in obamacare, workers compensation laws, tax laws, etc.
many of the same people who endorse universities skirting these labor laws would be outraged if pfizer tried to do the same for their employees - while at the same time they claim the student workers are doing more work in the field than corporate pharma employees.
if they're doing the work, they're workers and deserve to be paid and protected and taxed as such.
and more importantly, those employees should be given living wages and health care.
the universities are basically operating a system that is only marginally better than chattel slavery.
capitalism, it's just what you need to make progress with healthcare.
(also wars, they're a good place to experiment with new techniques.)
&gt; considering us does 95%+ of the medical research in the world, none of these countries would have these medicines to begin with.
this is something to consider, too.
people don't realize that big profits also drive innovation.
it's kind of a necessary evil.
boom.
roasted.
/dumdermifflin the pharmaceutical industry isn't healthcare.
healthcare relies on the pharmaceutical industry, your great healthcare in the uk can only hand out cheap viagra because someone else made it in the first place &gt; healthcare relies on the pharmaceutical industry which is a huge part of the problem.
healthcare has turned from treating illness to treating symptoms.
hence the last time a actual cure came on market.
hence why the cure to hepatitis is highly dependent on the size of your bank account.
people die from liver failure while a cure literally sits on some pharmacy shelf.
and your point is.....?
that your "haha we have it great over here" attitude is only possible due to some other area being productive enough for you to mooch off you do know viagra was synthesized in england, right?
using which company again?
and how are we mooching off people?
[deleted] ...he’s making some good points.
what part of what he’s saying makes him a “troll”?
is it the anti-socialist part?
that is a bad idea.
people are going to die when they combine it with nitrates.
it'll only be available from pharmacies, i.e.
a consultation with a pharmacist will be required before a sale is made.
and fyi, nitrates + sildenafil doesn't mean people are going to die.
when changing a medication's classification from prescription only medication (pom) to pharmacy only medication (p), they consider potential for harm.
if it were that dangerous, it wouldn't be given a p classification.
and in case you didn't already know; sildenafil was originally intended as a drug for angina - it was during the clinical trials where they noticed the side effect it's famous for and pfizer remarketed it as an ed drug.
i’m guessing that given the popularity of even generic, pricing will continue to come down.
price doesn't drop until a second generic manufacturer enters the market (pfizer doesn't count, that's an authorized generic) it's already available as a generic.
not exactly.
generic sildenafil (revatio) is available for heart conditions in a different dosage.
you can take multiple revatio tabs to get the same effect if your doctor will prescribe it.
any other generic 'viagra' is a cheap chinese or indian knock off.
if you want to take pills made with bathtub chemistry, knock yourself out.
pfizer's generic will be the best because it will contain the same binders, really just the same pill in a different color.
this is worth any price premium over teva.
i'm a pharmacist here in the uk.
we get legitimate generic sildenafil all the time because our doctors prescribe it frequently for erectile dysfunction.
and fyi, there's no "special recipe" for tablet binders because they're just bulking agents - all legitimate generics are required by law to show bioequivalent properties except in cases where the release mechanism is part of the drug's effects, e.g.
modified release.
yeah, i got some sildenafil online.
i should have gone to the dr because they was quite expensive.
here in the uk you'll be able to buy it over the counter soon.
sweet ray's all natural boner juice.
coming soon!
&gt; all legitimate generics are required by law to show bioequivalent properties not in all jurisdictions.
source: legal at a big pharma company.
if you think binders can not affect drug performance you're uninformed.
i've personally taken generics that behave rather differently than the branded versions, and had doctors complain to me about the same, to the point where they would only prescribe the brand.
and no they weren't being compensated for it.
you comment about bioequivalence is technically correct but manufacturers only need to show that peak blood levels are the same, in tandem with general safety &amp; efficacy.
binders can be any gras stuff.
duration is not a requirement normally.
**bottom line: not all binders are the same.
** &amp;nbsp; source: worked at pfizer for an extended period edit: downvotes from people who know fuck-all about process chemistry and drug manufacturing.
good one i never said that binders don't effect drug performance, i merely pointed out that the statement that a pfizer "generic" is inherently superior to another manufacturer's generic because they use a special recipe of binders is bollocks.
fair enough.
but 100% it will be superior because generic makers use the cheapest fucking binders available.
and- put another way, pfizer's 'generic' **will be the exact same pill** sans blue dye.
i'll take those hundreds of millions of r&amp;d dollars over teva and dr. reddy's chop shops any day.
any smart consumer would too.
they won't outright say it's the same pill because no one would spend more money for the blue version.
this is the only reason for the marketing speak about special binders.
same factory, same pill, different color.
and some of the highest manufacturing standards in the business.
teva can't claim that, and by default teva will have more batch to batch variability.
if one wants to cheap out and buy teva's product then great.
maybe it will work fine for them.
the de minimis savings aren't worth it imo.
teva is just one manufacturer that makes generic sildenafil.
we also get zentiva, mylan, sandoz and actavis made sildenafil.
and i'm now bored of the pfizer lackey spiel.
ta ta.
teva's my preferred brand for a drug i take for sleeping, trazadone.
the pharmacy rotates a half dozen brands of the drug, and one of them doesn't work as well, so i believe it can happen, but it's really rare and there are alternatives that are just as good as the original manufacturer.
it's true that for whatever reason; some brands work differently for some people.
but that's the exception, not true for an entire clinical subgroup of patients.
yet you aren't tired of behaving like a twat, which will unfortunately continue the rest of your life i fear.
and you brits pride yourself on good manners.
i'm no fan of the place just because i worked there, i just know how they do things.
one can only hope you are less of a tosser with your customers.
sorry i just don't have any patience for witless worms.
all hail pfizer!
p.s.
we have patients, not customers.
unlike pricks like you we don't seek to cut a pound of flesh from sick people every chance we get.
cunt face.
i'm beginning to think that this guy isn't a pharmacist that guy has no idea what he's talking about, you're wasting your time.
&gt;fair enough.
but 100% it will be superior because generic makers use the cheapest fucking binders available is bullshit when you consider bioavailability.
being a tech at a pharmaceutical company doesn't mean you understand the chemistry.
you know how to follow a procedure, you don't know how to make one.
that guy is all but declaring that there really isn't a difference between generic and name brand drugs.
i don't see how an actual pharmacist could say the things he's said.
do they do online degrees in the uk for this sort of thing?
there isn't a difference that is significant between name brand and generic.
a pharmacist would say that because they are aware of what the laws are and the approval process for the manufacturing of a generic.
ie generally lactose versus dextrose doesn't matter as a bulking agent he's declaring that there's not *necessarily* a difference, not that there's no difference at all.
the only difference will be between generic and branded and not between other generics.
(e.g all the pregablin drugs will be the same withing 1% but lyrica will be a lot better than the generics but the price difference is £1 and £87) it does not take much to reverse engineer a tablet.
legit indian or chinese companies would have zero issue.
from what i've seen, the "knock offs" from legit companies have similar efficacy at a fraction of the price.
&gt;generic makers use the cheapest fucking binders available not sure what you have against generics.
any imput into the manufacturing process goes through the same cgmp (or equivalent) checks and balances.
lay off the blue kood-aid.
source: also worked for pfizer i've used the generic knock offs and they work wonderfully.
nothing against generics generally, i just see no point in buying a generic when the pioneer is available for close to the same price.
there are a bunch of idiots in the thread so i'm going to lay out a few things for the rest of us.
reverse engineering the api sure, or a cr/er formulation.
but the whole pill?
not so much.
they don't need to do this and will choose less expensive binders anyway because their margins are lower.
why is this hard for people to understand?
this exactly.
i've had meds that just wouldn't work when they switched to generic.
had to fight to get them back to regular.
for the most part generics have worked for me but once it failed spectacularly.
specific generics will have specific interactions with other drugs or conditions.
the pharmacist / doctor should catch those cases and specify the label the issue in the uk is that, if your doctor isnt prescribing you a branded version of the drug, youre going to get whatever the cheapest generic is as the nhs wont pay you for the branded unless specified on the prescription.
what a lot of people dont understand is that the generics such as amlodipine made by almus and the amlodipine made by teva are really the same and lots of them are the same manufacturer, just different packaging but if there was a branded version called aminex and it was made by pfizer, did work better but costs double the price, no pharmacy will give it out unless its specified &gt;did work better that only happens if the bioavailability is different which it cannot be for a generic.
the threshold i *think* is 3% &gt;i've personally taken generics that behave rather differently than the branded versions, and had doctors complain to me about the same, to the point where they would only prescribe the brand.
and no they weren't being compensated for it.
this is anecdotal.
&gt;source: worked at pfizer for an extended period it makes sense that someone who worked for pfizer would have a negative *opinion* of generics.
that doesn't make your anecdotes evidence.
this comment was paid for by the pfizer company.
buying these drugs is foolish.
try sildenafil citrate.
i get 20 milligram pills for $1.00 each.
guess what these are?
that's right, generic viagra and they have been available for some time.
viagra is actually a different name for the original drug.
i forget the name of the original drug but it was meant to treat people with some sort of a heart problem.
when men began to report that they had great erections the company had the fda approve it under the name viagra for impotency.
the original drug was eligible for a generic version a couple years ago and that happens to be sildenafil citrate.
talk to your pharmacist.
mine is the one that told me about them.
the 20 mg sildenafil tablets aren't indicated by the fda for erectile dysfunction, only for pulmonary hypertension.
so, *technically* doctors aren't supposed to write for it that way, and pharmacies aren't supposed to dispense it that way.
it totally happens, but pfizer has done everything they possibly can to prevent it.
you seem well informed.
so sildenafil citrate is over the counter and essentially the same thing as viagra?
is this what you'd recommend or is there some other varient e.g kamagra that would be better.
it's not over the counter.
still a prescription bed but yes same drug in smaller dose that explains why my doctor still writes the prescription for viagra.
they change it at the pharmacy.
fun fact: the drug "pitocin" that is injected into a mother to be to induce labor was actually originally created to treat stomach ulcers but has the side effect to induce labor.
we’ve had generic (or other name) “viagra” in thailand for well over 10 years.
the best one is called kamagra and it comes in pill format or a gel pack that is fruit flavored.
i think this comes from india.
the cost is about $1.
i can’t believe people pay $65 for a brand name.
our government likes to make sure drug companies are profitable.
drug companies pay bribes to our politicians to keep it going.
i think they call it “lobbying.” shady as fuck, but legal.
it certainly is shady as fuck.
legal does not always mean ethical and lobbyists sure do prove that.
&gt; sildenafil citrate 100mg @ .72 per pill http://www.samrx.com/buy-sildenafil-citrate.aspx meh.
cialis is better.
you can get a combo of both in one capsule from some ahem...."research chemical" companies.
the, uh, lab rats respond well.
where can you buy this?
i'm, uh, asking for a friend.
you can get liquid versions of tadalafil and sildenafil citrate without a prescription.
one such place for us customers is called peptide pros, but there are others.
i've bought both and i can confirm they do work similarly to the pill forms.
the liquids have a rather unpleasant taste, but they work.
&gt; not for human consumption gives one pause... &gt; &gt; not for human consumption &gt; gives one pause... [not really.
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/off-label_use) appreciated, but the companies selling these things are specifically stating that people shouldn’t ingest them.
that’s not what “off-label” means.
my friend buys it from madison james research.
i heard.
that's not generic, that's a low cost pill owned by the same company that stands to make a profit.
the big question is why are they selling a low cost product after milking the brand name?
brand loyalty, simple as that.
pfizer understands that the market of 'brand-loyal' blue pill takers will absolutely jump ship as more competition hits, because that name recognition is only going to take you so far when the generic is a fraction of the price.
especially when it comes to something as important as being properly aroused when trying to have some sexy time, you're going to have people more likely to stay with what the know works - as long as they can justify it.
so instead of losing the lion's share of their drug's users to generic manufacturers, they'll lose less by being the "premier" generic.
you could get free samples by the little brown bag full at the clinic, and refills for $10 bucks a boner.
then the prices started to skyrocket and we learned how to cut these little blue footballs into thirds and quarters just to get some righteous wood.
greedy big pharma got all up in my junk's mojo @ $62 a pill.
i'm taking a generic version of ravatio, which is the same stuff, just a different dosage.
i'm taking it for my heart.
technically pulmonary hypertension does viagra have any negative side effects?
i feel like it would be interesting to try one.
relevant bits from the wikipedia article.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sildenafil ----- **recreational use** sildenafil's popularity with young adults has increased over the years.
sildenafil's trade name, viagra, is widely recognized in popular culture, and the drug's association with treating erectile dysfunction has led to its recreational use.
the reasons behind such use include the belief that the drug increases libido, improves sexual performance, or permanently increases penis size.
studies on the effects of viagra when used recreationally are limited, but suggest it has little effect when used by those not suffering from erectile dysfunction.
in one study, a 25-mg dose was shown to cause no significant change in erectile quality, but did reduce the postejaculatory refractory time.
this study also noted a significant placebo effect in the control group.
**adverse effects** headache, flushing, indigestion, nasal congestion, and impaired vision, including photophobia and blurred vision.
some sildenafil users have complained of seeing everything tinted blue (cyanopsia).
some complained of blurriness and loss of peripheral vision.
in july 2005, the fda found that sildenafil could lead to vision impairment in rare cases and a number of studies have linked sildenafil use with non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.
rare but serious adverse effects found through postmarketing surveillance include prolonged erections, severe low blood pressure, myocardial infarction (heart attack), ventricular arrhythmias, stroke, increased intraocular pressure, and sudden hearing loss.
in october 2007, the fda announced that the labeling for all pde5 inhibitors, including sildenafil, required a more prominent warning of the potential risk of sudden hearing loss.
4 hour erection?
"call more ladies" so when are we finally going to get condoms laced with this stuff?
what is the difference between brand and generic if the same company sells both?
are they actually making the generic different?
no, probably no difference.
i'm a pharmacist and it isn't uncommon to see a brand drug go generic and still be the exact same capsule/tablet that it was before.
there are even some generic drugs out there that literally have the brand name printed on the pill.
the pill shape needs to be re-evaluated.
clearly, they need to be shaped like little dicks shaped like pfizer executives?
pfizer: little pill, little results.
i've been hearing radio ads for generic viagra for a few weeks now.
this explains it.
so when is upjohn pharmaceuticals coming out with their version?
[removed] [removed] can they please call it the boner pill?
named after karl m. boner the original chemist who designed it?
hasn't hydrocodone-acetaminophen been around forever?
"it's a bold strategy, cotton.
let's see if it pays off for 'em."
they are doing the right thing by not paying.
paying would just provide incentive for more attacks.
and its a leap of faith trusting these scumbags to actually unlock/decrypt exactly there would be nothing stopping them from saying well you payed 26k but we changed our minds were gonna need 26 more.
happened to my friends company, they do it security and a client had essentially opened up his whole business to ransomware attacks, sure enough a guy demanded half a bitcoin.
between delivering the bitcoin and the original demand it had dropped in value, and he wanted more.
that was when the value was just barely above 2500 bucks.
he was banking on the value being less than they would care about, and he was right, they figured it was easier to just find half a bitcoin on the market, buy it and be done with it.
lucky for them it was un-encrypted but they had no guarantee.
we are woefully unprepared for cyber attacks... you can have all kinds of fancy programs in place but it just takes a clueless employee to screw it all up... the article says the county got infected by opening up an email attachment with the virus.... that is basically how every company/household gets screwed lol.
thats why i don't use a computer of any kind.
regardless of what the replies are about to suggest.
now *this* is the way to validate your backup procedures, betting $26k that they're robust.
of course, they're a bit less than 100% confident, as they took two days to make a decision.
when i saw the headline i assume he killed him with a punch.
i can see how he could get manslaughter for that.
but a stabbing which requires a weapon?
nah.
&gt; but a stabbing which requires a weapon?
the article doesn't really mention what he was stabbed with or how.
he could have been stabbed with a pencil or a broadsword.
not really enough info in this article about what exactly went down to make any judgement.
http://www.cleveland.com/akron/index.ssf/2016/12/university_of_akron_student_di.html &gt; scheid is accused of grabbing a knife and stabbing unternaher in the chest, police said.
a third person in the apartment called 911 after the stabbing, saying unternaher and scheid were drunk at the time of the stabbing.
nice find!
other little details not found in op's article: &gt; sheid and the victim were out partying and drinking when they stopped to buy fast food to go and an argument ensued, akron police lt. rick edwards told the reflector earlier.
&gt; &gt; “the victim told the suspect not to touch his food.
that of course happened after they came back to the apartment,” edwards said.
one site said they got the food from arbys.
another included this : &gt; “not to get into the facts of the case too much, (but) i think it is important for the court to know that immediately after this accident happened kendal had (another roommate) call 9-1-1. when paramedics and police arrived, kendal was in the bathroom administering first aid to duncan, trying to keep him safe and keep him alive,” malarcik told the judge.
&gt; &gt; "he cooperated fully with law enforcement and told them everything that had happened here,” the defense attorney added.
&gt; &gt; devin rogala, scheid and the victim’s roommate, called 9-1-1 at 12:34 a.m. saturday.
rogala, after asking scheid, told the dispatcher that unternaher was stabbed “in the chest area” and was breathing, but “completely unconscious.” &gt; &gt; “i need an ambulance, as soon as possible please.
… my roommate stabbed my other roommate,” rogala said during the 9-1-1 call.
“they are in the bathroom.
he (scheid) is keeping pressure on the wound trying to keep him elevated.” &gt; &gt; rogala added that both of his roommates were “highly intoxicated.” &gt; “they had been (roommates) since their freshman year,” the police spokesman added.
“they were all fraternity brothers.” &gt; schied and unternaher were members of phi delta theta.
he originally plead not guilty to murder and felonious assault but then plead guilty under an agreement with prosecutors for the lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter what i still haven't seen is an explanation for what makes this an 'accident' as opposed to a drunken mistake.
right?
if you get too drunk and make the mistake of driving and accidently kill someone, i don't think you'd get away with the "oh, well it was just an accident" excuse.
could be the proximity of the knife.
if they were arguing in the kitchen next to the knives its less egregious than if they were arguing in another room and he left to go get a weapon and come back and use it.
one is an impulse the other is a decision i still call that impulse decision a form of murder.. not involuntary manslaughter.
there was really nothing involuntary about it, from what i've read.
you can call it whatever you want it doesn't show premeditation so its not treated like murder in our justice system.
ahem - second-degree murder: any intentional murder with malice aforethought, but is not premeditated or planned.
yeah, that's murder, bud.
he got a knife.. and stabbed him.
that's intentional and not up for debate.
not being premeditated is what makes it 2nd degree.
still murder.
here's a link about it: http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/second-degree-murder-overview.html involuntary manslaughter is more like when you are speeding and accidentally kill someone.
yeah, you didn't mean to, but it happened directly because of your actions, so it was involuntarily killing them.. hence, manslaughter.
*edit* - you said "our" justice system and i realized you might not be american.
what i said here applies to the american justice system.
i don't know about others.
he used a weapon in a fight and someone died and he's getting off light.
i don't understand your logic what does it matter what he stabbed him with?
the article says it was an accident.
if two drunk guys were arguing and one of them happened to be holding a pen while being tackled to the ground resulting in someone getting stabbed it would matter.
if one of them swung his hands up in frustration while holding a fork and didn't realize his friend had come up behind him resulting in him getting stabbed it would matter.
we could spend all day inventing wild stories where one friend accidentally stabs another with various objects in various circumstances.
the fact is we simply don't have the information to stay what happened.
&gt; the article says it was an accident.
that's misleading.
*the defense lawyer for the accused* said it was an accident.
there's a big difference between, say, shoving someone and having them hit their head on the way down and die and, say, stabbing someone in the throat with a pair of scissors.
not all "accidents" are equal in terms of culpability.
very true and in this case we don't have the information to determine what kind of accident this was.
we do know this guy was charged with involuntary manslaughter and not murder and that he got a pretty light sentence.
in absence of further details i'm going to assume that could very well be reasonable for the circumstances and reserve my outrage for the moment.
i agree with you to the point that nobody knows anything more than what happened in the article, the article doesn't really even quote or cite anything for "stabbing".
i wish i could see the evidence testimony.
3 years for murder, 5 years for illegal fire sharing http://www.webster.edu/technology/service-desk/illegal-downloading.html and 15 years for leaving bacon in a mosque.
actually, 6 years maximum, and she also smashed 6 windows, and slashed bike seats and tires at the mosque that never happened in america.
there was a girl who is being tried here in davis, ca for leaving bacon strips and breaking windows at the mosque on the uc davis campus.
well that sounds like vandalism and destruction of property so why wouldn't they be tried?
its also a hate crime well, whatever she gets charged with won't be for the bacon, it will be for the broken windows.
that's arson.
how is breaking windows arson?
it's actually grand theft auto i goofed and wasthink of vandalism.
arson is vandalism with fire, this isn't arson.
the bacon made it a hate crime as well releasing a bunch of puppies in a mosque would be much more fun you can't really count their laws as real laws.
they let their rapists off the hook if they marry the victim.
no one who wants to follow their laws is really compatible with the 20th century, let alone the 21st.
it wasn't murder..... [deleted] &gt;shit man, i know i've had a few beers but damn, my reading comprehension must fly out the window or something no, i think the problem is you don't know the definition for murder.
what you just described is manslaughter.
[deleted] why the hell do people get so angry at such stupid shit?
drunk teens and early twenties, shit can be dangerous.
his roommate got a life sentence (*death*) ... this fucking asshole only gets 3 years.
literally shaking my head as i type.
not exactly three years.
he will be eligible for release in ***six months***.
6 months!
that's a hockey season.
no shit.
i'd be so pissed if i missed the entire season for murdering someone.
at least let me out for playoffs.
do the right thing.
you know they don't get nbc sports in the house.
now that is a good attorney.
6 months if good behavior for homicide.
or a shitty prosecutor.
if you have a good attorney, he or she may be able to influence who the assigned assistant or da is or how you are brought to trial.
or a broken system.
there must be additional details to the case that aren't in the article.
*person of colour sips tea* that's 20 years for you sentencing to life (or killing him) over a drunk fight seems unreasonable as well.
he doesn't seem like he was out to kill, he was just drunk and stupid.
putting those people in jails permanently just seems wasteful, and comes across as just vengeful rather then for corrective action.
do we want people who stab others over fast food in society?
an asshole that randomly goes off over nothing and kills someone is scarier to me then an plotting murderer.
i don't want to be in a bar or whatever when this dumbfuck gets tilted over nothing.
this shows an extreme lack of control and judgement in this individual, why should society continue to be threatened with the random violence because this dude can't control himself?
it's not like this was victimless juvenile mischief kids grow out of, he stabbed his friend to death.. yeah, i agree.
this isn't one of those things that we all did when we were teenagers.
this is an unacceptable mistake that should carry an appropriate punishment.
you get about this much time for robbery or something, and that doesn't make sense.
maybe it should not be 20 years, but a chance to go free in 0.5 years if he's a good boy?
that's too low.
$20 says this dude winds up killing another person.
i'll take that action.
i had a big diatribe prepared.
something about decent people don’t consider violence even when intoxicated blah blah blah.
i’ll spare you that and distill it down to one nugget of wisdom from a friend of mine: “if you’re an asshole drunk you’re an asshole sober “ it's involuntary manslaughter, unless you have access to the court documents i'm not going to say he went off on a whim.
how exactly is a harsher prison sentence going to prevent this next time?
do you think that this guy was actually aware that he was capable of killing or even stabbing another human over fast food?
he probably had severe unresolved anger issues that he wasn't aware of or had no idea how to treat, and alcohol provided the catalyst.
what if this is literally the first time those feelings surfaced, thanks to being more drunk than he's ever been before?
ultimately, he is responsible for his own actions, but some people are redeemable, and i think that we should appropriately evaluate that and act appropriately.
it's better to allow someone to return to being a productive member of society if it's clear that the incident truly changed them.
i was willing to believe he was just an angry guy until i heard it was stabbing.
if it was a fist fight gone too far that’s one thing, but trying to stab someone is downright ridiculous, guy needs 5 years or more of quality rehabilitation, its not just a drunk mishap, he’s not fit for society.
if he's in jail he's not stabbing people over fast food.
part of criminal justice is removing those who can't function correctly in society so that their ability to harm others is reduced.
for many people, getting caught leads to "corrective action."
very little evidence on how long they have to be imprisoned for this to take effect.
i agree he ought not to be in jail for life, but the sentence does seem relatively light.
eh, guy who went to my high school got in an argument and brawled with a guy with a pistol in his hand, killing the other when it went off.
manslaughter - 3 years.
keep in mind though he's now a violent felon and the decently well paying career he had is gone forever, when he gets out he'll probably be living at home with his mom at 30 and be lucky if he can get a job making more than poverty levels of income.
i don't think a lot of people actually know what normal sentencing is for crimes, massive sentences of 7+ years are not common even for violent crime.
and the punishment isn't just time, it's also lack of options getting out when people raise uproar that us prison population is too high a big factor outside of drug crimes is the fact that so many people balk when they hear sentencing and constantly demand they must be longer and longer.
we have really inflated sentencing here relative to most developed western nations because of that.
i'm ok with reducing the prison population by reducing time for non violent drug crimes etc.
but violent criminals?
you're really ok with someone who gets drunk and violent and kills somebody being released after 3 years?
how can you possibly be ok with that?
wait.
i'm confused.
some guy had a gun, your friend wrestled with him, and the gun went off, killing the guy brandishing a weapon and your friend got in trouble for that?
if that was correct, how the heck did that happen?
seems like self defense and an accident.
i wouldn't call us friends, just a guy who went to my high school.
he(guy convicted) was the one with the gun.
he grabbed it out of his truck and tried to pistol whip him when it went off.
oh.
i read that wrong.
that was a dumb thing to do.
so he meant to beat the shit out of the guy with his pistol and ended up shooting him to death?
you're high school acquaintance got off extraordinarily easy.
even if it was accidental, that he went to his truck to retrieve the weapon, means that it was more than an oopsie moment.
he was driving away when the guy leapt into the bed of the truck and started beating on it trying to break the back windshield.
he didn't fish it out and bring it back to a fight, he was trying to leave from the argument when the guy followed him and he grabbed it stepping out of his truck in an effort to get him off his truck.
you guys keep making assumptions, the best assumption when you hear a manslaughter charge is assuming there were a considerable amount of complicating circumstances muddying up arguments for intent and reasonable defense.
people spent weeks deliberating over the facts of the case, who are we to say they're wrong based on snippets?
because a gun is best used as a club.
yeah i pull out my stabbin knife whenever i get drunk too, glad he’s going to be free soon i’m sure his temper won’t ever be an issue to anyone else again.
that fact that this asshole was drunk doesn't make him any less dead.
good thing drunk is an excuse for violence, right?
i didn't rape her officer, i was drunk.
oh, then you're free to go.
&gt; he doesn't seem like he was out to kill, he was just drunk and stupid.
i would have agreed if this was a fist fight, but he picked up a knife.
do the crime do the time.
lets pretend he killed your daughter.
im sure you would be cool with 3 years doubt it, on the flip side of he was my son this would be nice.
there's a middle ground between 3 years and life i don't disagree.
it wasn't 1st degree murder, with malice and intent, but he's eligible for release in 6 months.
i mean.
he should have to be punished a bit more.
like no release before 3 years at all.
and even that is pretty light.
he says he was just drunk and stupid.
it seems very reasonable to me to remove a murderer from society.
our prison system has nothing to do with corrective action.
if it did you would see a massive transfer of wealth from working people to criminals.
there isn't enough money in the world to correct adult career criminals.
so to be clear you’re saying having a harsh penalty for murdering someone seems wasteful?
you can see the white crazy in his eyes, release him and it will happen again i guarantee.
i hate the "he was just drunk and stupid" argument.
it's ridiculous.
people need to own up to their actions and take responsibilities for their mistakes and crimes, whether or not they were sober.
if you can't control yourself when drunk, then you shouldn't drink alcohol.
he had someone call 911 and seems to have taken a guilty plea, i'm not sure how that isn't owning up to it.
he did get one of his room mates to call 911 to get help so he must have admitted to it as well.
it's obviously not pre meditated.
he may well have shown remorse.
it's not a great situation but you'd need all the details to be sure as to whether the sentencing is appropriate.
no wonder he called 911 he just fuckin killed somebody would you give someone 6 months possibility of parole if they gave a rape victim a towel after?
will remorse bring his victim back to life?
will serving a life sentence do it?
nope but the rest of humanity is now safe from a person who thinks it is a funny drunk joke to stab people.
or maybe someone who made a huge mistake that he's unlikely to repeat spends the rest of his life in prison and no one wins.
where did you get the idea that it was a funny drunk joke?
the fact is that without the details you don't know.
stabbing someone isn't a mistake.
forgetting your keys is a mistake not getting an oil change is a mistake.
a huge mistake that he was sentenced to three years in prison for.
it's a bit disingenuous to compare it to losing your keys.
what do you think would be a fair sentence?
this stabber is extremely lucky.
this was a very lenient sentence!
have to make room for all the "evil" drug users that need nearly a life sentence to keep them from making themselves feel good i am sure someone who kills another over food will never be a danger to society /s 3 years more than kate steinle's killer got, so i'd still count it as a win.
that was an actual accident, though.
only 3 years??
wtf?
pussy pass?
if my roommate looked like that, i'd wonder if i was going to get stabbed.
is it because he's a ginge?
i mean, yeah.
they don't have souls.
it's also a little bit the haircut and beard.
i mean yeah?
it must suck to not be a ginger and still feel threatened by them found the insecure ginger.
but really, no one is threatened by them, everyone is just making jokes.
also a joke no one wants to fight a person with no sole &gt;no sole well, maybe they should get some new shoes?
did he also get a 4.0 for the semester because his roommate died?
it would be cool if sentences for crimes like this included a penalty of never being allowed to drink alcohol again.
for dui's many times probation requires that you not drink and be willing to submit to tests.
right.
the reality is that not everyone is able to use it responsibly.
til that to get away with murder, you just have to be drunk when you do it.
ridiculous.
and it has to involve fast food.
or chips.
&gt; murder involuntary manslaughter.
and he didn't get away with it.
6 months minimum 3 years maximum.
he got away with it it wasn't pre-meditated.
that's a key component.
you can't "get away with something" you didn't plan on doing.
the way you have that worded almost sounds like you're ok with crimes of opportunity.
i doubt that that's what you mean, however.
i bet no one *plans* on getting so drunk that they drive the wrong way down the highway &amp; turn some unwitting vehicle into a burning heap, either.
and whenever that happens *everybody* lines up to, rightfully, crucify the asshole who did it.
reddit is especially on-board with sending drunk drivers to prison for extended sentences.
so what's the difference in your mind between drunk stabbing &amp; drunk driving?
you could say that someone who gets into a vehicle when drunk is *knowingly* placing someone else's life in peril.
but isn't stabbing someone *also* knowingly placing their life in peril?
why else would you stab them?
not to mention, lots of people drive drunk without causing death—making drunk driving, in a certain sense, more reasonable than drunk stabbing.
in my mind, he planned on stabbing his roommate the second he picked up the knife.
he didn't plan it for very long, obviously.
but he didn't 'accidentally' stab his friend to death.
he stabbed the guy to death.
3 years is getting away with it.
and white.
this coming from a white dude.
worked for kate steinle's killer, oh wait... nah this guy got charged with *something.
* best thing to do is run the over with your car, then, claim you didn’t see them/they swerved in front of you (particularly helpful if your target is on a bike).
you’ll probably just get a ticket.
or be an illegal alien living in a sanctuary city.
no wait, the guy in this story actually got punished while the illegal literally got away with murder.
shit posts in /r/the_donald and /r/conspiracy.
how shocking.
this country puts people away for life for having a few ounces of crack on them, and this fucking guy who *murdered* someone gets 3 years?
wtf is wrong with this country?
there was a thread posted asking reddit what was the quickest way you know that someone fucked up their life.
well... here you go.
tbh it’s just gonna be 3 years of his life.
but it's gonna follow him to the grave... a classic mcds vs tacobell deathfight.
winner gets to choose where to eat dinner.
that article was so sparse on details that i’m surprised that a lot of people itt are upset or angry that the judge (who had more access to information than any of us) sentenced him to 3 years.
[removed] &gt; the parameters of the argument.
its only a matter of time before society's collective rage at mcd's inability to get the bun, filet, tartar &amp; cheese centered on the same vertical axis triggers widespread unrest and a constitutional crisis.
excuse you, but in-n-out is greater than all.
and i’m a fan of bojangles and raising cane.
shit is **so** good.
them's stabbin' words, friendo... i felt dirty going to popeyes, but sometimes you get desperate and need the fix....since there wasn’t a bojangles remotely close.
bojangles just has that extra edge on pretty much all of the staples of my ideal fried chicken meal.
even if i got past the shitty popeyes biscuit and their sub par version of seasoned fries.
if we were just comparing chicken, bojangles clearly wins.
and cheerwine versus cherry coke?
not even close.
going off on a tangent here, but bojangle's bacon, egg, and cheese biscuits are full of stars.
goddamn, them shits is delicious.
a man was just sentenced to 15 years for breaking windows and lights at a house of worship.
he also left bacon on the property.
is this justice?
a man is dead and his murderer gets three years while a hateful man destroys property and gets 15 (with another 15 on probation)?
our justice system is broken.
our penalty system is broken.
there are almost no facts in this article.
there may have been some realllllly bad facts that the prosecutor didn’t want to take to trial, and thus they were forced to make this deal.
itt: outrage culture mixed with ignorance.
there are countless academic papers and studies on the sentencing disparity in the us.
the statistical findings date back to the 20's...i'm not sure outrage culture is unwarranted if this issue is quickly closing on 100 years.... just another lesson that only you can protect yourself, because the justice system sure won't if something happens to you.
involentary manslaughter, had someone call 911 and tried to save him... idk what you can do.
you can try not stabbing people.
that's a pretty good option.
it's so crazy it just might work.
idk, not stabbing people is pretty easy.
i've managed to do it my entire life.
i've only stabbed one person.
is that close enough?
did it turn out that the person was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the protozoic era?
fossil records don't lie.
u/knowbrainer is a time traveler confirmed.
nope :( just some punk who thought he could get away with stealing and left instead with a nasty scar.
*involuntarily* stabbing someone during a fight strains credulity.
heh that's my local news channel, neat.
yeah, but why are we reading about a story in ohio from an affiliate in norfolk?
they report on all stories of interest, even if not local.
but coincidentally, we do get overrun with a tin of tourists with ohio plates every summer.
killed someone over fast food...get three years...murder...and only three years.
must be a white kid.
(goes to view story....3...2...1.... yep) of course ohio, so glad i got out of that shit hole.
i visited columbus early this year, had a great time.
it was nice, friendly people.
shhh!
ohio is a shit hole.
just listen to all the smug reddit hipsters who love to make edgy comments and broad, sweeping generalizations.
i mean, you have anecdotal evidence of a visit, and i have anecdotal evidence of living there 20 years and an article about a dude killing his friend over fastfood so... *shrugs* i'm with ya.
fuck that place with a pinecone, or maybe buckeye anal beads.
let me guess......his parents are rich.
so ill make a fucking prophecy before i click the link.
**"this guy must so white.
hipster kinda white, teen influenza kind of white"** and... click edit: yup, white boy.
edit: gone in 6 months.
well, another good one for usa.
yeah that's not long enough.
reminds me of something that happened at my university.
two friends were arguing over a video game.
they used plastic cutlery and paper plates all the time.
the one friend jokingly picked up a plastic knife and threated his friend in the kitchen.
the other friend leaned toward him trying to tower over him.
the arm holding the knife was jarred against the counter.
the knife entered in-between his ribs and peirced his lung.
he lived but the family still wanted to press charges since it "couldn't have been an accident since he stabbed him."
is no one else interested in what they could have possibly been fighting about over fast food that could’ve escalated to this?.
did someone eat the other guys fry?
did they argue over the correct spelling of filet?
did someone say “pass the meat craft” and the other refused?
i seriously can’t find any other info than it was “about fast food”.
i hate that people treat being drunk like it's an excuse ..... rules for getting the justice system on your side 1. be white.
2. don't be unwhite.
to be honest tho what kind of life do you have after even the max 3 years where you have to disclose to every job opportunity that you spent time in prison for murder?
essentially no information on this horrible source.
i know!
how can i make a decision on whether this was a fair sentencing, without knowing what kind of fast food it was?
was it mcdonalds?
hang him!
five guys or in-n-out?
probation.
these things must be considered.
fucking 3 years is the max he will spend in prison.
he could get out in 6 months.
you know he must be rich and white yeah that makes sense seeing as how an illegal immigrant just got off the hook for murder completely.
fuck off.
3 years?
even for manslaughter, that is quite low white people have a different set of rules.
this is bs.
it should be 30 years, not 3. i don't get why people are upset at this sentence.
in the rest of the civilized world, this sentence is not out of place for the crime committed.
if i kill your mom and claimed to be drunk would you be okay if i went to jail for 6 months and got released for good behavior?
maybe i'll swing by your house after and bake you a "sorry i killed your family" pie i'd argue getting off easy with stabbing someone to death isn't very civilized.
i would argue that you don't know the meaning of civilised.
if america is more socially developed than other countries then why do they have such a high crime rate and reoffending rate in comparison?
the american justice system usually focuses on punishment rather than rehabilitation.
this may be good in theory, but compared to countries that focus on rehabilitation, it has a negative effect on society as a whole.
if i was assaulted, i would rather the perpetrator be reintegrated as a productive member of society once they have shown remorse and an understanding of what it means to be part of a civilised society rather than rot away in jail and resenting a society that has left them behind.
i'm not arguing the american system is better.
i however don't really believe most other countries, even european countries, would give a minimum sentence of 6 months in prison to someone who got a knife to plunge into their roommate's chest.
drunk or not, that's not someone who should be let off lightly.
doesn't sound civilized to me, unless you think they can rehabilitate in that short amount of time for such a crime.
spoilers, they won't.
that'll learn 'em.
just don't break into and leave bacon at mosques, that'll get you five times that sentence.
leave bacon *and smash windows, lights, and various other things.
* that clarification, while important, still leaves us in a situation where property damage is worse than violently ending someone else's life.
hard to get on board with that.
except it's not just property damage, it's property damage with the intent to intimidate a protected class.
intent matters.
yeah because the petty vandalism totally justified a sentence of over 10 years, meanwhile a murderer gets less than 3. this is what being soft on crime looks like.
america - hard on crime.
most violent country in oecd.
every other oecd country - soft on crime.
lower crime rates than the us.
fun fact.
the bionic woman jamie summers lived in ojai.
seems like they could use her help elvira too.
fire is 100,000 acres and still spreading.
my family has been out of our home since early tuesday.
it seems our neighborhood escaped the worst, but that was before last night's gusts.
i have co-workers from ojai and casitas vista whose homes are in the danger zone.
one of my son's friends lost his home.
i think it is a shame that this isn't farther up on /r/news
i wonder what theyre going to do with ten tons of cocaine.
i mean what is the street value of 8 tons of cocaine anyway?
you wonder what their going to do with it?
the united states government has been the "worlds largest drug distributor" for the past 150 years.
they have the perfect scam, declare war on a substance, put it on the street so people have access to it, arrest a good number of said people take everything they own and everything they'll ever own, and in the process confiscate what's left of the substance for redistribution on the street, rinse and repeat.
the east coast is about to be flooded with a fresh batch of high quality snow.
i hope its cheap.
capturing the narcotics from several vessels in the eastern part of the pacific ocean &lt;------???
why bring it all the way to florida?
florida is an excellent distribution hub for the 6 tons of cocaine ahhh i see what you did there.... uscgc escanaba is home ported in boston, ma.
so the drugs were dropped off in fl on it's way back to ma.
canada helping us coastguard in florida.
anyone else scratching their heads on this one.
&gt;john sipher, who spent 28 years in the cia’s national clandestine service, argued that while direct targeting of us diplomats is rare, unintended harm caused by surveillance efforts that go wrong are much more common.
&gt;“these efforts, while designed to further surveillance and eavesdropping and not to cause malicious damage, nevertheless risked or resulted in residual physical harm to us diplomats,” sipher said in a commentary on the just security website.
i am curious as to what specific type of equipment is used for this.
this makes more sense to me then cuba deliberately trying to cause harm.
they wouldn’t have much to gain a lot to lose if they intended to harm the diplomats.
there are plenty of factions, cuban included, that would gain from a further breakdown in us-cuban relations.
russia, for instance, is cuba's #1 creditor and maintains close relations with the island nation.
they don't have to do much.
the big cheese has already made it clear that he wants to be the antithesis of obama.
that includes souring relations with cuba cuba stands to gain a lot more from improved relations with the us than the us would gain from them with cuba.
the us would get another cheap vacation destination, cuba would get rapid modernization and billions of dollars worth of outside investment.
ya which is why they were working with the obama administration to improve relations.
[trump threw alot of that out of the window](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/white-house-implements-new-cuba-policy-restricting-travel-and-trade/2017/11/08/a5597dee-c49b-11e7-aae0-cb18a8c29c65_story.html) https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uzbekistan-incident-raises-suspicions-of-russian-involvement-in-cuba-attacks/ methinks it's not cuba.
so you're saying that cuba and donald trump have some things in common.
someone has insidious technology that can cause permanent damage without those being harmed even knowing.
imo, that's the scary part of the story, never mind bump stocks and high capacity magazines, this is way worse.
&gt; without those being harmed even knowing pretty sure they know now according to the story, they didn't know until they had symptoms, the device operated outside of human hearing ranges.
might be able to shed some light.
my dad is an acoustic consultant, and he has a masters in acoustic engineering.
when i asked him about this incident and what could be causing it, he postulated that the cubans likely had some sort of surveillance equipment that was broadcasting at a frequency that is harmful to humans, but is also outside the audible range (20 - 20k hz).
high decibel sounds within the audible range can be damaging, so i imagine it would be essentially like exposing yourself to a motorcycle engine *all fucking day* except you cant even hear it.
but that does not cause changes to brain white matter.
i am an electrical engineer, and i am quite skeptical of the claims that this was done with pressure waves of any sort.
besides the fact that we already know that such waves do not cause that kind of brain damage, the physics of that claim don't pass muster either.
moving that much air will always produce effects in the environment that you will notice, and requires huge drivers to do.
it definitely would not be a portable device.
&gt;moving that much air will always produce effects in the environment that you will notice, and requires huge drivers to do can you clarify this?
obviously something like a wifi router isn't putting out a ton of sound pressure but its presence is entirely unobservable as a sensory experience as far as i'm aware.
what sort of environmental impact would you expect to see from something blasting 100 db at something in the mhz-ghz range?
that’s insane to think about.
thanks for asking your dad, he sounds like a good person to have around during a crisis like this.
does he have any thoughts on what could possibly cause the destruction of white brain matter?
this whole thing is a fascinating yet terrifying juncture of world politics, engineering,’medicine and spy tech.
radiation of some type.
possibly just plain old x-ray.
i thought it was a sonic weapon you might hear something when your ear nerves get microwaved.
no.
people (including state dept spokespeople) speculated this, but it never added up.
diplomats definitely reported hearing weird noises, but you're not damaging the brain or causing the described symptoms with airborne sound waves [unless you directly couple the sound generator to your head, or it's so loud that the building is shaking].
there are, however, some scenarios that can cause you to hear sound from *electromagnetic* waves: you'll have heard stories of people in the old days hearing radio stations through their head, w which was no exaggeration - em signals can be picked up with things like metallic tooth-fillings, which then vibrate and resonate through the skull.
it's not beyond the realms of possibility something similar happened here.
strong signals like that would be picked up as interference on microphones too, and would sound pretty similar to the audio samples they presented.
strong microwaves also are known to cause brain damage.
my god, there is another sane person in this world.
this story about "ultrasound weapons" has me feeling like i am on crazy pills, because it is such pseudoscience nonsense.
the whole story almost feels like a counter-intel psyop to begin with.
i swear the stories that the cia makes up got a lot more idiotic after tom clancy died.
i think what happened with the ultrasound-weapon theory was a case of "a little knowledge is a dangerous thing".
my pet theory, is that someone unqualified in the embassy went on wikipedia, and saw mentions of studies that ultrasound has been found to cause brain-damage in mice.
what they didn't appreciate was the context of that study: that it wasn't airborne ultrasound (it involved coupling the mice's head to the ultrasound scanner directly or through water).
but this became folk knowledge amongst the staffers, then it leaked, and of course the media ran with it... it's always sounded like wiser heads in the state dept have been trying to rein in that speculation ever since, without embarrassing their embassy staff.
there is nothing about the symptoms described consistent with radiation poisoning.
we are familiar with radiation poisoning.
this is different.
radiation poisoning is from ionizing radiation (x-ray and above), lower frequency rf causes other issues.
yeah, and i was responding to the suggestion that this was from x-rays.
that doesn't jive with what i know about em radiation.
wouldn't the eyes have gone blind as well 'scuse me, i speak jive: http://americanenglishdoctor.com/wordpress/jive-and-jibe/ i bet you were chomping at the bit to say that before you even stepped foot in the room.
https://www.bathroomreader.com/2014/04/chomping-vs-champing/ https://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2014/05/step-foot.html from what i've heard minor tumors from radiation from directed microwave listening devices.
the soviets dumped so much microwave radiation in to our embassy in the attempts to listen in that an old joke was that you'd be glowing after 6 months there.
allegedly of course.
microwaves are non ionizing.
they lack the energy to damage dna, and if you get hit with enough to cause harm, the boiling water in your skin would let you know &gt; microwaves are non ionizing really?
tell that to [this plasma](https://science.wonderhowto.com/how-to/make-ball-plasma-microwave-194331/) radar and tv antenna techs have maximum permissible levels of exposure for a reason.
while there hasn't been a strong link between l-band rf and cancer the studies typically don't look at exposure levels as high as implied here.
yes, but those antennae are measured in the tens of kilowatts of power output.
my interpretation of the above theory was that surveillance equipment was broadcasting up in the kw range (60 dbm+).
sounds like a lot of power but if you want to broadcast omnidirectionaly, able to punch through walls, and be able to pick it up at a decent range (with tech of that era) you would probably need to a fair bit.
that much?
that's more than i expected.
it is also based on the assumption that the carrier frequency is high enough to be out of range of common rf devices.
10+ ghz tends to have poor range, especially through structures, so if you are a few blocks away trying to pick it up with a whole string of houses in the way... would love some to run some numbers and come up with a better guess though.
this is a very old story about how the soviets used something akin to very early rfid to power bugs by blasting them with huge amounts of rf.
which again, never caused any symptoms like in this story.
&gt; radar and tv antenna techs have maximum permissible levels of exposure for a reason it's so they don't microwave themselves to death in a melty ball of human flesh-soup.
these exposure limits are maximum intensity limits, not cumulative energy limits.
unlike with ionizing radiation, there is no time limit for exposure as long as you are under the intensity threshold to begin with.
mmmm that's almost right but there are certainly time limits for exposure for hf, vhf, and uhf em radiation at different wattages / frequencies.
the safe exposure limits are way less than the levels that would cause even perceptible heating, net alone being melted.
there is a lot more to the spectrum than the 1-22 ghz that is readily absorbed by water.
have a look at [rfcafe](http://www.rfcafe.com/references/electrical/fcc-maximum-permissible-exposure.htm) for some good info with sources.
&gt; hile direct targeting of us diplomats is rare, unintended harm caused by surveillance efforts that go wrong are much more common.
good to know.
so that killed my diplomat dreams stack a couple dozen marshall dsl100s on a truck, point and sound maybe a very powerful and focused electromagnetic attack?
a directed emp, so to speak.
boom goes the emp cannon?
directional microwave canon.
it's a radio transmitter that also accidentally acted as a microwave.
it explains all symptoms including the sounds.
i'll find a link to a paper that shows you hallucinate sound when your head is exposed to certain rf bands.
here: http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/scc28/sc4/auditory%20effects.pdf well it has to be some kind of microphone that targets a specific area but must transmit some kind of waves that are dangerous ?
i have no idea.
it's very strange there was a similar incident to this when we were building an embassy in the ussr.
though they were shooting microwaves at diplomats which gave some of them brain tumors.
this is much more sophisticated weapon though a similar type of attack.
i know this isn't /r/science, but microwave radiation is non-ionizing and there is no evidence that it causes cancer or tumors: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/a:1018449003394 non-ionizing radiation by definition does not have the energy required to destroy dna (and thus cause cancer) the way gamma rays, etc can.
focused microwaves can still cause localized heating which over time could be disruptive to cellular processes.
not saying that's what happened, but it could be an angle of investigation.
interesting enough the naval yard shooter was complaint about that very thing days before he shot up the place.
the guy who shot up the movie theatre had a similar tumor issue i believe.
the naval yard guy didn't have a tumor.
he said he was hearing voices and felt like microwaves were heating him up.
the ft lauderdale shooter said something animal about voices.
they both went to authorities before.
interesting.
what about in a frequency range of 2.5 to 4 ghz?
edit: microwaves i guess are pretty low frequencies vs gamma rays which is a very high frequency.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3509929/ edit: this did happen, but "the conclusions were that no adverse health effects of the radiation were shown."
&gt;the authors state “however, **it was not possible to find any satisfactory explanation for this, due mainly to the small numbers of deaths involved and the absence of information on many epidemiological characteristics that influence the occurrence of many types of malignant neoplasms.”** (page 243).
the study itself links it to longer time spent in moscow, which might have been due other things, such as increased drinking, worse healthcare, stress, etc.
the article itself states that there are literally hundreds of different factors that are involved and the small number of deaths are not statistically significant.
all the rest of the peer-reviewed journals also don't mention any significant risk from microwaves.
finally, if the 2.5 to 4 ghz range is really problematic, then we're very screwed as most of the wireless devices we use emit rf frequencies ranging from 2.4 to 5 ghz.
that's all microwaves are.
it's radio frequencies operating at a specific frequency.
microwaves in that range are able to heat cells due to moving molecules around, but it's not capable of moving electrons around and being in a warm room as the same effect.
they can cause severe burns which could potentially cause skin cancer.
even then that is extremely rare.
cancer development due to scar tissue of a burn has many other factors involved and isn't so much just because the tissue is damaged.
learned this from our plants microwave radio guy awhile back.
the microwave i am referring to is point to point radio systems we use with our scada.
this right here guys, is why you never place your router on your microwave.
it will kill your wireless when you turn it on.
stick your head in a microwave.
turn it on.
a microwave will cause tissue heating and potential damage if it's strong enough edit: microwaves are around 2450 mhz which makes water molecules vibrate and heat up.
heating your soft tissues like this is a terribad idea &gt;stick your head in a microwave.
not falling for that one again.
i mean you would be falling down if you did.
instructions unclear.
microwave auditory effect.
it's where you hear a voice inside your head.
this is one of the most interesting stories so far this year.
the technology to do this must be pretty damn impressive.
if, as speculated, it's a microwave emitter, it's not actually much more complex than your wi-fi router.
actually it could be less complex since it doesn't transmit information.
wouldn't a microwave emitter cause blindness first and foremost ?
... do you mean blindness?
[deleted] ... you mean blindness right?
yes xd (phone with german autocorrect, dunno what blindmost is supposed to mean though) this is why i never leave my house without an aluminum foil lined hat.
looks like i get the last laugh gotta protect yourself against allomancers.
r/unexpectedsanderson that's why you should invest in wood.
nah, you invest in aluminum, protects against rioters and soothers.
you can make aluminum bullets to fight coinshots and lurchers.
https://www.howtogeek.com/by114037/researchers-prove-tin-foil-hats-boost-receptivity-to-government-signals/ looks like i will be switching back to my lead helm.
line the inside with mercury, just to be extra safe.

edit, i don't know why that goes to leafist, not complaining though.
that's what they want you to think!
the one time i took it off was at work.
now we might actually see tinfoil hats all the time instead of just at home!
#tinmantoo someone get john noble, anna torv, and joshua jackson on the case oh boy, oh boy, i do sure need a new episode of fringe right now.
x-files returns on january 3rd i think.
not enough walter bishop.
i think it would be perfect if walter bishop showed up in a new x-files episode.
that would make an awesome movie.
"we keep trying to tell you!
we're actors!"
fringe quest why would cuba themselves do this?
makes no sense.
could be it was some listening device and the people who put it there were ill informed about it.
you know the old saying, always attribute something to incompetence instead of malice.
russia did this, and has done so on us soil back before 9-11-2001...... [removed] that's some james bond shit actually it was a mainstream news story in the los angeles times.
not the *entertainment* section.
it was essentially a covert act of war.
there's been a covert war with russia since 1945. there was a break in the 90s when it looked like we might start getting along.
yeah, right up until we interfered in the 1996 russian election and got boris yeltsin, that corrupt drunk, re-elected.
[here's time magazine bragging about it.
](https://i.redd.it/isllgiy7ch9z.jpg) &gt; the outcome was by no means inevitable.
last winter yeltsin's approval ratings were in the single digits.
there are many reasons for his change in fortune, but a crucial one has remained a secret.
for four months, a group of american political consultants clandestinely participated in guiding yeltsin's campaign.
&gt;braynin began a series of confidential discussions with yeltsin's aides, including one with first deputy prime minister oleg soskovets, who at the time was in charge of the president's nascent re-election effort.
finally, in early february, braynin was instructed to "find some americans" but to proceed discreetly.
"secrecy was paramount," says braynin.
"everyone realized that if the communists knew about this before the election, they would attack yeltsin as an american tool.
we badly needed the team, but having them was a big risk."
&gt;for two days the supersecretive yeltsin high command avoided dresner, and none of the team ever actually met the president.
"there are too many factions and too many leaks to risk your dealing with him directly," braynin explained to dresner.
"you are our biggest secret."
wait, i don't understand.
did the us actually interfere with the election or did they just send some election advisors?
i feel like interference implies something a bit more underhanded and nefarious.
that was an act.
russia has been actively lulling the west into a sense of complacency since the 90's.
what are you talking about?
there were legitimate attempts by yeltsin to strengthen the bond between russia and the west.
that's a very western perspective.
yeltsin needed money from the west, and played along with nato expansion etc.
but the rest of russia was never really on board.
totally agree.
russia was in chaos in the 90s.
yelsin knew what he was doing when he selected putin before that even, soviet spies were in the us way before ww2.
since the red revolution in 1917. what?
it's been made pretty clear that there is nothing to support that.
by whom though?
it's not in cuba's apparent interest to do such a thing.
know who does want the us out of cuba?
trump and the american far right.
not sayin, just sayin.
edit: aaaaand the thread is being brigaded by the deplorables.
and who else...russia same thing.
it could be in the interests of a rogue faction of cuban intelligence which feels that improved us-cuban relations would loss them power and money.
exactly.
communist dictatorships aren’t exactly known for rational thought.
cuba is a communist dictatorship.
apparent interest and actual interest don’t always coinside.
with that being said, i don’t know if they’re actualky responsible but i’d certainly wager that they know who is.
and yea, that’s a cool theory you have there.
100% not rooted in fact but interesting anyway.
placing my bets!!!
$5 on [ciguatera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ciguatera) damn, most of the side effects from this toxin seem to fall in line with the reported ailments.
i think you might be right.
it seems weird that cuba would do this.
what benefit would there be?
seems more likely it’s a third party.
this.
i'm guessing the russians.
.
.this fits their m.o.
and they have the motive.
i honestly think the only thing cuba is guilty of would be shit security.
the russians may have had some knowledge from old allegiance or possibly parties still loyal to russian motives that enabled them to pull it off.
100% conjecture.
more than willing to listen to hard evidence.
anyone using the word "conspiracy" can fuck right off.
with all the recent news about russia, it wouldn't surprise me at all.
yeah, recent news meaning almost all of the last 55 years.
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uzbekistan-incident-raises-suspicions-of-russian-involvement-in-cuba-attacks/ yup , i think it has something to do with russia.
why is this being referred to as an "attack", rather than a medical mystery?
in other words, how do they know that this was caused by an attack and not something else?
because those involved are specifically embassy personnel.
if it were a chemical plant then a medical mystery would be more likely.
assumptions based on collective symptoms and witness reports?
still does not have to mean an attack.
as the top comment says eavesdropping gone wrong seems far more likely.
found the cuban intelligence officer.
actually thinking about it i agree.
if it was some sort of rf or accoustic emitter then a simple sweep would have found it.
could it be some sort of chemical contamination?
and all this time we thought people wearing tin foil hats were the crazy ones.... sounds like the start to a fringe episode.
i hope suitable recording devices have been set up at the embassy and the homes of embassy personnel.
at least that would tell if there was real sound or if it was perceived as a result of something else.
there is a recording of it.
https://www.apnews.com/88bb914f8b284088bce48e54f6736d84 sounds like extremely powerful radio waves.
i remember a video of some russian kids touching a plant to a 500kw transmitter and it started singing a high pitched frequency like that.
it would make sense with the speculation that it’s a microwave transmitter.
thanks, i forgot it was published already.
so there is real sound associated with the attacks, be it the primary weapon or incidental.
they are overlooking the obvious.
[earwigs.
](https://i.imgur.com/p5etkjo.jpg) they recorded the sound!
&gt; the case has plunged the us medical community into uncharted territory.
funny because you'd think us physicians funded by the intelligence community inventing a medical procedure called "rectal feeding" 10 years ago in the same country would have been perceived as uncharted territory.. huh?
rectal feeding has been around for longer than that.
it's use as a form of torture is what *might* have been new.
ir isn’t was used directly for torture though, is it?
just keeping people alive that refuse to eat in order to facilitate more torture?
&gt; the most specific finding to date about physical damage from the attacks shows that whatever it was that harmed the americans, it led to perceptible changes in their brains.
it is one of several factors fuelling growing scepticism that some kind of sonic weapon was involved.
cut the crap.
the cia knows exactly what this device is, they probably invented it.
sorry, your cover is blown now.
just tell us what it is, what kind of damage it's capable of, how often it's been used, what to watch out for, who may have this technology, etc.
no, don't.
we'll be 3d printing them by the end of the week.
i'd rather not have my brain turned to jelly by a troll from 4chan.
u.s. personnel in cuba are being injured by an unknown weapon, and your response is to turn that into a rant about the cia?
aren't you a cynical fuck.
&gt; being injured by an unknown weapon this is pure speculation, not based on facts.
no, he has a point — the cia probably does know exactly what it is otherwise, they’re doing a really bad job keeping tabs on weapon technology, ruuight you sound like the cynical fuck exactly; it's the cia's job to know what this is and invent it if it does not exist yet.
the first thing i thought is that hell its probably a cia anti-surveillance device.
blasting out ultrasonic noise to jam somebody else's eavesdropping.
&gt; they’re doing a really bad job it's the cia and cuba.
they don't exactly have a great track record there.
the blame-america-first crowd never misses an opportunity!
maybe it was one of these turned up to 11: https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/the-nypd-is-using-mobile-x-rays-to-spy-on-unknown-targets/411181/ tinfoil hat guy not looking so crazy.
if they did then why not use it against say....the iranian embassy?
or if you wanted intel on effects why not use it on a mall or federal facility in the states where you can control the exposure to the media?
nothing makes sense about your theory logically, only via emotional bias.
how were they "treated"?
what unalters the white matter in your brain?
treated likely means supportive care in this case, there is no treatment for this sort of thing as far as i know.
especially since the cause is unknown.
given the insanity of this, and the tinfoil hat sounding things coming out that sound more like sci fi, i feel at a complete loss for what has happened here.
honestly, from my own perspective, this seems to sound more like a case of "something was being used in this location that was either used improperly or was far more harmful than stated".
as few, if any, of the potential "weapons" used would make sense, unless a nation somehow developed a new weapon that could be moved and deployed in this one location for whatever reason.
another part of me thinks, maybe an illness or disease, that also spread in paranoia to others who think they also went down with it?
maybe a chemical weapon, but potentially also just a local / new iillness.
yet my main belief right now sides with something was likely being used that was more harmful than people were led to believe, or that some form of equipment was not properly shielded, or had been used without proper safety precautions.
with some being from a nocebo of being around people who had been affected.
all this "ray gun from far away", or "satellite microwaves" just comes across as a sci-fi / futurology circlejerk that is normally reserved for whenever the term "ai" is used.
people who suffered from alzheimer's and cte are only confirmed with post mortem examinations.
did they figure this out with diviners rods?
they diagnose alzheimer's with mri, pet scans, and cerebral spinal fluid samples.
they don't have to wait for the person to die.
&gt;the strongest biomarker candidates for alzheimer's disease include brain imaging studies using magnetic resonance imaging (mri) or positron emission tomography (pet), and proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (csf).
https://www.alz.org/research/diagnostic_criteria/ demyelination or [white matter hyperintensities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hyperintensity) can be be assessed with mri, and white matter tractography mapped with [diffusion tensor imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diffusion_mri).
i am curious how did they know it was sonic attack?
did some ppl hear sounds?
yes and recorded it.
i kinda hope they're quarantined...?
gut reaction.
aliens bro.
this is all aliens!
i want examples of electronics that can beam microwave radiation to people!
it sounds a lot like it was some advanced version of technology first seen in the thing.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_thing_(listening_device) listening devices.
microwave radiation at wavelengths harmful to living tissue.
that didn't seem to matter much to the russians.
this completely creeps me the math out.
this sounds zika related adem.
did they test them for zika antibodies?
this here's a real headscratcher.
unless it happens again we might never figure it out.
this is some tom clancy or michael crichton shit!
possibly a microwave weapon.
hearing "noises can be a symptom of exposure to high energy waves.
as a canadian who has been to cuba many times.
please please keep up the restrictions on us travel to cuba.
sad that you care more about your cheap poverty tourism than the lives of cubans whose morbid bound economy would be utterly transformed.
american here, but i agree.
went a few weeks ago and i just kept thinking, "we're going to fuck this up sooner than later."
awwww...are we ruining your favorite place to see authentic brown poor people?
he's got a point, the moment americans get to travel to cuba is the moment that it becomes a cheap ripoff of las vegas without the charm.
mcdonald's, starbucks, kfc and all the others, with cuban cuisine being culturally appropriated.
megacorporations will make megabillions but the cuban people will not see one thin dime of it, except perhaps to serve as prostitutes.
american corps will bring in immigrants to work in the casinos and restaurants as cubans would be accustomed to having workers rights.
the wealth gap between rich and poor in cuba is almost nonexistent.
americans just can't seem to go to a place and not try to turn it into america.
canadian here, you're absolutely right.
[deleted] people always think microwaves but in reality there's only a small portion of the energy spectrum that doesn't cause us a great amount of harm, and many of them are more practical than microwave plus people will generally notice when they're being microwaved.
they get vision changes and such.
&gt; they get vision changes and such.
where've you been?
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/09/30/all-the-theories-about-whats-happening-to-the-diplomats-in-cuba/ &gt; for the past several months, u.s. diplomats in cuba have suffered unexplainable symptoms, from hearing loss and vertigo to nausea and concussions.
some say they're struggling to concentrate and recall even common words.
yes i am aware.
those symptoms are not consistent with microwave exposure.
[removed] i glad you posted this twice.
just once wasn't off topic enough.
*making a documentary with delay would make them millionaires, or so his story went.
all they had to do was work as prostitutes and pass their earnings to him* how could these girls believe any of this.
he is either the slickest man in the world, or these girls are exceptionally stupid.
they didn't realize that he'd just delay his promises perpetually.
pretty sure the term is 'bottom bitch'.
oh they stopped the rampant murder of white farmers across the nation?
nope.
i wouldn't go back even if they paid me to if i was him.
that's your hometown we're talking about.
especially if there's sentimental value which can't be replaced, where do you go?
i have more sentimental value for my life than i do for a patch of dirt.
not everyone thinks like this.
i could give fuckall about my hometown.
i loved living in my hometown growing up, but quickly said "fuck you" to it when i saw what the mortgage payments would be to live there.
the new guy is saying the right things, inclusive, etc.
good luck zimbabwe mugabe also said these things, however
&gt;“each participant in the weinstein sexual enterprise had a systematic linkage to each other participant through corporate ties, contractual relationships, financial ties, and the continuing coordination of their activities,” the lawsuit adds.
weinstein allegedly employed an “army of spies” to track and intimidate journalists and his alleged victims, the new yorker reported last month, which plaintiffs’ attorney steve berman said is the basis for the rico allegations.
&gt;“we think these entities, the army of spies, as one article called it, were all facilitating and using wires and mails to orchestrate,” berman told the daily beast.
“this a: allowed [weinstein] to continue doing this over the years, and b: covered it up.
when you’re using wires and mails —which are governed by the racketeering act — for the illegal purpose of raping and sexually harassing, that falls squarely within rico.” we need a lawyer in here man, rose mcgowen really fucked up his shit for the rest of his still long life.
which is the best part - prolonged suffering for that piece of shit.
i want to see what uma thurman has in store.
i suspect she is withholding until this "round" is all over so she can blast him if he happens to squirm free from most of this.
what are the particulars with uma thurman?
rumor has it her next movie will be called "kill harvey."
i hope it's "uma and harvey in the the thunderdome".
most profitable 20 minute film in history.
i hope she feels that she is getting vindicated, but honestly it has taken too goddamn long.
it's been a twenty year fight for her.
that's almost half her damn life spent living with this horrible shit.
let's not forget about ashley judd as well.
i mean, he's still out of the country.
i assume he has a secret account somehow and is never coming back.
gonna do the whole palanski thing.
i guess his life will be different, but still better than most people.
i do hope he does face justice though.
i wonder what other wealthy and powerful private citizens are employing private intelligence organizations to pursue various agendas why this isn't an international incident, i'll never know.
literally using a foreign intel service to facilitate the sexual assault and silencing of us citizens.
i guess certain nations get a pass for that sort of thing!
careful.
thats dangerous territory we live in interesting times.
where the fuck is rico?
is this not the very definition of "organized crime?"
the guy had a team of ex-mossad private sector ninjas doing his dirty work for him.
[black cube,](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/09/harvey-weinstein-israel-intelligence-firm-black-cube) look into it.
edit: oh, and he had a fucking hit list!
shit.
i missed the bit about mossad.
do you have more on that?
https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/08/ex-israeli-pm-introduced-weinstein-to-agents-who-suppressed-abuse-allegations or, you know, our president?
president is a publicly held position.
trump is not at this time considered a private citizen while he holds office.
already word that proposals are going around wh for him to use some blackwater type spies.
starting to wonder if the guy pissed off the wrong people.
piss off enough people...you do the math.
i remember reading a rumor that his brother was trying to oust him from their company and that’s how this really all got started.
sometimes criminals just get caught.
you can't rise to the top without pissing off people.
but he had the protection of the clintons and the democratic establishment.
now that the clintons are done and the democratic establishment is in shambles, he is wide open for the taking.
harvey was a major champion of the clintons and his rise and their rise coincided.
http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171009105637-harvey-weinstein-hillary-clinton-2012-large-169.jpg https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/hillary-harvey.jpg?w=700&amp;h=393&amp;crop=1 i figured heads would roll after hillary's loss, but i didn't realize it would be so widespread.
had hillary won, weinstein would be sitting pretty and would be untouchable.
but he bet on the wrong horse and he has no protection.
wait.. is your entire source of information for this story 2 pictures of hilary clinton and him together and the fact that hollywood is generally liberal?
how, exactly, did the clintons protect him and keep his sex crimes hidden?
not sure why i’m even asking, i know you’re not going to respond to this.
you forgot benghazi, emails, and obama being from mars or some shit shhh.
we aren’t supposed to talk about that.
talk about what?
two pictures of a donor with a top member of the party he donates too?
that seems like the expectation.
she knew.
anything that supports that claim?
she’s been married to a rapist for 40 years and she has spent much of that time covering for him and slandering his victims.
she had to have known when she met him that he was a total creep.
so that is a no ?
well, no she hasn’t admitted it, if that’s what your saying.
if logic isn’t your thing, then move on.
she does not have to admit it but you need some evidence beyond those pictures (which show nothing) and that she is married to bill (a completely separate person from harvey).
if you had a recorded conversation of those two talking about or some text message logs that would be one thing but right now all you have is a hunch and that is evidence of nothing.
the article mentions criminal stuff like rico, but this is a civil suit.
[wikipedia list of famous rico cases](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/racketeer_influenced_and_corrupt_organizations_act#famous_cases) &gt;rico laws were successfully cited in now v. scheidler, 510 u.s. 249, 114 s. ct. 798, 127 l.ed.
2d 99 (1994), a suit in which certain parties, including the national organization for women, sought damages and an injunction against pro-life activists who physically block access to abortion clinics.
the court held that a rico enterprise **does not need an economic motive**, and that the pro-life action network could therefore qualify as a rico enterprise.
the court remanded for consideration of whether plan committed the requisite acts in a pattern of racketeering activity.
extortion is included in illegal activities that rico covers.
harvey did threaten and bribe his victims, and he used pis and ex-spies to dig up dirt on them to encourage them to stay silent and/or settle.
the other people knew about his activities and covered for him.
some helped by scheduling dinners and meetings with women without giving the actresses any warning.
[rico can be civil](https://www.google.com/search?q=rico+civil&amp;oq=rico+civil&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2870j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=utf-8).
at what point does one of the members of the board at the weinstein company walk into harvey's office, place a pistol loaded with a single round on his desk, and say, "harvey, just do the honorable thing."
before walking out and closing the door behind him while the theme from "it's always sunny in philadelphia" plays in the background?
i feel like the trailer park boys theme would be better.
he was fired by the board way back when the news first hit.
true, but they're named in this racketeering suit.
nevertheless, there's no office to go into and no desk to drop a pistol onto.
do you pick apart every hypothetical situation you read, or is it just this one?
hell, make it the desk at his home office.
well that would just be trespassing then and while carrying a weapon no less.
for actions that took place before they distanced themselves from him.
denouncing your former criminal associate doesn't absolve you of having worked with him for decades.
edit: ok i think i see what you were getting at...never....it never happens because they know he would never sacrifice himself for anyone else use to be in the old days the romans would have a big party for convicted traitors.
all their family would come, they’d drink and eat.
then when the time came, the convicted would walk away and slice his wrist open.
this was away to ensure that his family wouldn’t receive any punishment if assume the responsibility.
surely harvey as seen the godfather 2 like frank anselmo in city hall, huh?
classic.
i want him to do a full budd dwyer on live tv.
wasn't bud dwyer innocent?
why can’t this ogre slip into obscurity already as soon as he gets justice, sure.
too well connected.
stay tuned.
i read this as weinstein accused of r**o**cketeering in new class-action lawsuit great another lawsuit instead of a prosecution just shoot him already.
it's going to be so hillarious when weinstein trials inevitably lead back to bill and hillary clinton, the favor exchange for donations, the weinstein "fundraisers", etc.
and the trump bunga bunga parties at mar lago.
remember when he was a big financial supporter of clinton?
but way to use "whataboutism" to down play weinstein's hundreds of victims.
do you have any clue how stupid that response was after you posted this: &gt; it's going to be so hillarious when weinstein trials inevitably lead back to bill and hillary clinton, the favor exchange for donations, the weinstein "fundraisers", etc.
probably not, i don't think you have the intellectual wherewithal.
i was just surprised that rather than agreeing with me that all these pervs need to be held accountable, you started whining about trump.
way to play, boss.
you got this!
yup, hopefully there is proof!
did you see the long nyt article about weinstein?
turns out his protection ran way deep, everyone knew about him being a rapist, even hillary.
the dominoes are starting to fall.
we should elect her to political office!
future first lady of france.
at minimum she's judiciary material.
she looks like she'd clean up nicely.
not guilty.
oh.
my.
god.
that guy should be put behind bars forev--- huh?
it was a woman and a 16 year old dude?
nevermind.
she should sell her story to the filmmakers behind call me by your name.
prime oscar bait material!
i do find it odd that all these articles in the past few years about teachers having inappropriate relationships with students, every time i click on it the teacher is the female.
in my memory i dont know the last time i saw an article like this that involved a male teacher.
inb4 reddit says this is rape and sexual assault
could this be from the fact that parity is linked to a decreased risk in breast cancer?
so birth control would increase one’s risk because it decreases parity.
most breast cancers are progesterone, or estrogen positive tumors, increasing your hormone levels will increase the risk of these tumors.
there are rarer cancers, that are triple negative or not-hormone positive tumors but these are rare and aggressive cancers though.
the studies never discusses the parity in correlation with breast cancer, theres probably other studies out there.
but this one specifically about hormone use and breast cancer.
&gt; could this be from the fact that parity is linked to a decreased risk in breast cancer?
so birth control would increase one’s risk because it decreases parity.
that's not how it works.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/parade.com/37175/parade/why-do-nuns-have-a-high-rate-of-breast-cancer/amp/ [contemporary hormonal contraception and the risk of breast cancer](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1700732) **abstract** &gt;background &gt;little is known about whether contemporary hormonal contraception is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.
&gt;methods &gt;we assessed associations between the use of hormonal contraception and the risk of invasive breast cancer in a nationwide prospective cohort study involving all women in denmark between 15 and 49 years of age who had not had cancer or venous thromboembolism and who had not received treatment for infertility.
nationwide registries provided individually updated information about the use of hormonal contraception, breast-cancer diagnoses, and potential confounders.
&gt;results &gt;among 1.8 million women who were followed on average for 10.9 years (a total of 19.6 million person-years), 11,517 cases of breast cancer occurred.
as compared with women who had never used hormonal contraception, the relative risk of breast cancer among all current and recent users of hormonal contraception was 1.20 (95% confidence interval [ci], 1.14 to 1.26).
this risk increased from 1.09 (95% ci, 0.96 to 1.23) with less than 1 year of use to 1.38 (95% ci, 1.26 to 1.51) with more than 10 years of use (p=0.002).
after discontinuation of hormonal contraception, the risk of breast cancer was still higher among the women who had used hormonal contraceptives for 5 years or more than among women who had not used hormonal contraceptives.
risk estimates associated with current or recent use of various oral combination (estrogen–progestin) contraceptives varied between 1.0 and 1.6. women who currently or recently used the progestin-only intrauterine system also had a higher risk of breast cancer than women who had never used hormonal contraceptives (relative risk, 1.21; 95% ci, 1.11 to 1.33).
the overall absolute increase in breast cancers diagnosed among current and recent users of any hormonal contraceptive was 13 (95% ci, 10 to 16) per 100,000 person-years, or approximately 1 extra breast cancer for every 7690 women using hormonal contraception for 1 year.
&gt;conclusions &gt;the risk of breast cancer was higher among women who currently or recently used contemporary hormonal contraceptives than among women who had never used hormonal contraceptives, and this risk increased with longer durations of use; however, absolute increases in risk were small.
(funded by the novo nordisk foundation.)
i'm scared, i have the progestin only arm implant because my fucking doctors said it was safer.
for what it's worth, your risk of breast cancer was always low.
per the npr story, the increase is equivalent to basically 1 extra case of breast cancer for every 8,000 women on birth control.
but - being on hormonal birth control reduces the risk of other cancers, including endometrial, ovarian, and rectal cancers.
i wouldn't be too worried.
talk to your doctor about your concerns, but the overall increased risk is small.
it's understandable to be scared when new information like this is in the news.
but i encourage you to use this an opportunity to ask your doctor about this study and what it means to you.
this study just came out today (technically it will be printed tomorrow in the nejm).
physicians spend most of their lives working to help others (there are exceptions, unfortunately).
we don't like finding out that something we did wasn't the best thing for someone.
it's literally the exact opposite outcome of why we go into medicine.
the reason that this new information is available is because other doctors spent time doing research to find out how to take better care of their patients.
the average physician works 60 hours a week.
the people that did this study spent extra time away from their family and friends, probably after seeing patients all day, and will get paid little to nothing for doing this study (in fairness, it does look like it was supported by a grant, so they may have been paid for their time).
the only way medicine could be perfect is if we stop learning new things.
if we never learn anything new, everyone will pat themselves on the back for doing the best that we could and go home feeling great.
for what it's worth, this article found a roughly 1 in 8,000 chance of getting breast cancer (which is usually not fatal).
to put that in perspective, you have a 1 in 114 chance of dying in a car accident (https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-mortality-risk or http://www.nsc.org/learn/safety-knowledge/pages/injury-facts-chart.aspx).
any idea on wether something like an iud would mean less systemization and less risk compared to an arm patch or pill?
i would presume so, but definitely don't know for sure, drug absorption is unfortunately very complicated.
we use pills every day, so we're a lot more comfortable with how they are absorbed.
despite that, i learn something new from a pharmacist every week (thank you, pharmacists, for being so nice to us).
hopefully someone else will chime in here, i know there are lots of docs/pharmds on reddit that know a lot more about this than i do.
read the r/science thread on this, they seemed pretty skeptical that it was as bad as headlines indicated the implant is a lower dose than the pill.
same with iud's like mirena.
also, with mirena it keeps the hormone "localized", as it was explained to me when i got mine.
you're just as likely to die giving birth as you are to get breast cancer from this.
oral birth control is not the *only* option.
true.
i was just putting that number in perspective.
why are you scared?
did you actually read the article and the study?
you have a very small increase in your chance for breast cancer.
don't feed into this bullshit.
being scared is what they wanted when they tried to call 13 additional cases in every 100,000 women a significant number.
i've known too many people that have been messed up by hormonal birth control.
it screwed with my liver values, gave my mother blood clots, and outright nearly killed someone i know via a stroke.
but no one talks about this.
it's mind blowing to me.
i honestly don't think many people know about the risks.
and they often don't realise how it can mess up other medications.
when a doctor asks people what medications they are on, a lot of people never think to say they are on the pill because they have normalised it as a daily thing and they think medication means 'things i take to cure illness' and forget about the pill.
so much this.
i remember being in high school and for a lot of girls, it was like a right of passage to start taking the pill.
because god forbid a guy wears a rubber./s at least in my circles (woman in university, usually sciences) we all know the risks.
and bout half the woman i know still take them because they know guys will give shit about wearing a condom/refuse to.
and so many guys won't wear one.
i have friends who hate it but still take it, because he wants it for sex.
i've known one guy in my entire life who was super into condoms every time/safe sex.
everyone else moans and complains, especially if you've been sleeping together over a month.
he's on reddit, the one who wore condoms, so if you see this anthony, shout out for being awesome there.
we need to teach men that they can't just demand women get on birth control.
but i can't imagine that happening.
i see guys complain about it on reddit.
but my view is if you aren't mature enough to wear a condom, you aren't mature enough to have sex wow what a reward, he actually cares about the safety of the women and he doesn't even get to raw dog it i have zero problems telling a guy to.shove it.
some ladies don't.
but such is life after i found out i had thyroid disease, i got on the pill (for the second time) and i went through three different pills before i was like "fuck it" and i got mirena.
best decision i have made in my adult life.
i have some spotting, not no discernible cycles.
i get pinchy feelings every once in a while, but it's way better than severely heavy periods and debilitating cramps.
it's stuff like this that makes my wife not use any birth control.
it's annoying that i have to use condoms to avoid pregnancy in a years long monogamous marriage, but it's better than a baby and she stays healthy.
get a vasectomy?
i've been on the pill for almost six years, i've been strongly considering switching to an iud.
this is all the evidence i need to switch the real kick in the pants is that they already have much safer forms of birth control but they don’t sell them because they work too well.
in other words, it’s not profitable because you don’t have to take a pill every day.
always comes down to greed.
would you mind elaborating on this?
i'm curious.
no.
take my claim with a grain of salt because unfortunately i read about this probably over a year ago, so i don’t remember the specifics, or my source.
however, i can say it was convincing enough to me at the time to remember about its existence.
it may have been a different type of implant that is much safer than current forms of birth control and also worked indefinitely until removed.
because it’s so effective, cheap and long lasting, it wouldn’t be as profitable as the pill for example.
those are the details i remember but again, since i can’t back it up my claim doesn’t hold much water.
however i stand by my comment.
ah okay.
i believe there is the birth control that men can take.
i vaguely remember reading there were trials in europe for that, but for various reasons i don't think that would be a success because generally (not always) it's the woman who has the highest stake in not getting pregnant, so i wonder how much trust women would put in men on being diligent taking birth control.
i'm sure there will be better ways in the future, science is always coming up with new things, and we're always figuring out ways to get around obstacles.
i dated a guy once who told me that if an oral contraceptive for men would "even make [his] dick hang slightly to the left" he wouldn't take it.
like there could be absolutely no side effects.
and lots of men have that mentality.
not saying all men, but they don't want anything even slightly adversely affecting their junk.
well, for married men like me we would definitely take it.
obviously i’m just as on the hook for any kids we have, and at the same time condoms suck to wear.
incidentally, my wife also hates using the pill.
i plan on getting snipped after the next kid.
she wants three though so that will be a fun conversation to have.
right now all of the male contraception injection options are horibble.
it's just a low dose of test e or c with synthetic estogren (bodybuilder steroid).
it dramtically lowers your testosterone, and let me tell you, lowering your testosterone to 0 and replacing it with outside testosterone is a big deal.
you would not be able to stop taking the injections, screwing with the htpa feedback axis destroys your ability to produce testosterone and the various estrogens you need to function on your own.
you would be dependant on injections for the rest of your life, unless you used dangerous anti breast cancer drugs (serms) to restart your hormonal axis.
i feel bad for woman having to bear the brunt of contraception, but the fact is they don't have an htpa axis like men.
introducing exogenous hormones does not destroy their ability to produce testoserone or various estogrens.
right now, your best bet is definitely a vasectomy.
i hear good things about vasogel as well.
but the male birth control shot is not in the near future.
funnily enough the pill actually lowers libido for a certain percentage of women too....googles...between 15 and 30 per cent.
seems oral bc just isn't great either way, huh.
let's hope other options will pop up soon.
sure.
i was thinking more with casual sex, or new relationships really.
from a woman's pov a guy could just skip off into the sunset in those circumstances.
i guess if the side affects for male oral bc was far less than what woman have now than it would be a winner in commited relationships.
iirc its a gel injected into the ovarian tubes or testis that is effectively a vasectomy.
the gel could be removed.
effectively an easily reversible vasectomy .
major props to the ny times for fully explaining the statistics.
nice changes from clickbait articles where they have play with the statistics to make a bigger story i just dont trust the pill.
im legite afraid of getting a blood clot, and the few months i was on the pill it really fucked me up.
i do wonder if its a great idea for young girls should go on it so early, before they settle into their cycle...thats become a thing these days, and i know there are legite reasons for some girls/women and that's cool- we alll need to cope in life so i don't begrudge that, individuals need to weigh these things up and there should always be the option.
but if you have a relatively pain free cycle i just dont think the risks of going on the pill, especially for years without a break are worth it.
i had a blood clot on the pill when i was 20 and found out afterwards i have factor v leiden.
in hindsight, i'm very glad it happened then and not during a pregnancy where the risk of clotting is many times higher than being on the pill and would have probably put me and the fetus in a lot more danger.
i use a copper iud now and am very happy with it.
hopefully i can get sterilized in the future.
for many women, the pill is the easiest solution for being in a heterosexual relationship.
most effective methods (&gt;99%) are hormonal besides the copper which i have.
unfortunately, a lot of women don't get on too well with it because of the heavier periods and some women convince themselves they're being poisoned with copper which is just not good for their mental health.
what we need is effective birth control for men besides vasectomies.
condoms are great but they break and can be tampered with.
my partner has a vasectomy.
but the pill made me anxious depressed and suicidal and really fucked with my mind (i was on it to regulate my cycle).
on top of that i was worried about getting a clot because my mother did and they said it was likely birth control.
so after i stopped...i decided it wasn't worth it.
we do need better birth control.
the more options the better.
i have a prescription from my ob and i'm still waffling about whether i want to take it.
my husband and i, historically, have a 100% success rate pulling out, and between the risks to me, my experience with moodiness while on another pill, and my superstitious dislike of taking anything while i'm breastfeeding, and the fact that we want to get pregnant again about a year from now... ugh.
i mean, i'll probably take it.
but research like this just makes me even less happy about it.
will be glad when we are done having kids and my husband can just get snipped.
everyone’s experience with medication is different, and just like with medication for an illness, you often have to shop around for the right birth control.
if it makes you feel better, your chances of getting breast cancer are slim before the pill (unless you have one of the other risk factors like smoking), and the pill is pretty easy to stop whenever.
it took me a couple different tries to get the right one for me.
i now take marlissa (combined pill) and my cycle is regular, my periods are much lighter, and it’s helped with some general everyday anxiety.
if you really don’t want to take the pill, iud’s have a very low failure rate and (generally) you can conceive within a week or so of removal.
again, it might take a few different tries before you find the right one that meshes with you.
obviously, i’m not a doctor.
i’d recommend you talk to your doctor, especially if you really don’t want to take the pill.
they can help you find a good bc method that works for you and your husband’s needs.
being on the pill is much safer than being pregnant in young women.
okay?
but you know there are more than just two options.
you don't have to choose between 'pregnant' and 'being on the pill' there are other options.
like what?
condoms?
abstinence?
no thanks.
there are more than those options.
first of all, condoms is a good idea if you're not in a monogamous relationship because the downside to that is stds *and* pregnancy.
and some stds are worse than pregnancy.
or you could have non-penetrative intimacy.
or if you're in a mongamous relationship and you don't want kids the guy can get a vasectomy.
there is also the nuvaring, or an iud.
there are about 20 different birth control options you know.
&gt; condoms is a good idea if you're not in a monogamous relationship i'm in a monogamous marriage and i still use condoms.
they're cheap and easy.
first of all, yes, i use condoms, but i don’t want to use *only* condoms.
that is too high risk for me.
i also don’t *just* want non penetrative intimacy, i want sex.
i’m not in a monogamous relationship.
and most of the hormonal birth control options, like nuvaring and the patch, come with similar cancer risks because they’re the same hormones.
well, if you're afraid of pregnancy iud (non hormonal) has a higher success rate than condoms or oral contraceptives.
but do whatever you want, i don't care.
as long as people know all the options and all the risks then the point is to have as many options as possible.
as i said before, sometimes people need to take the pill for whatever reason, and people should do whatever makes their life easiest.
huh.
i was just a child at the time but i specifically remember my grandmother saying that birth control pills and breast cancer were somehow linked.
this was around forty years ago.
yes, which is why the article said 'still' in the early years it was linked to breast cancer...they refined the pill and the risk became much lower.
that was my understanding before reading the article.
my doctor always asks first with some types if i have history of breast cancer in my family.
i think the patch type is known to increase the risk of breast cancer but decrease the risk of ovarian and colon cancer.
wouldn't be surprised if this varies from different types.
hm, how long until we find out that hormone replacement therapy causes cancer as well?
because those are far larger doses.
we know that; it does.
&gt;small but significant increase pick one.
&gt;that is, for every 100,000 women using hormonal birth control, there are 68 cases of breast cancer annually, compared with 55 cases a year among nonusers.
okay, so not really significant, then.
definitely not worth the pain and suffering of motherhood.
it’s really not.
as long as you don’t fit any of the other risk factors, you should be fine.
as someone who is way too young for a child, a method like the pill is super convenient because it is easy to stop if i want to have a kid.
it also helps to regulate periods and sometimes ease symptoms of pcos/endometriosis.
i would much rather have a slightly increased risk of breast cancer (when my risk was already slim) than have an irregular cycle/risk becoming pregnant.
i mean, i do have some of the other risk factors and it's still not threatening to me.
i have a hormonal iud primarily to control menorrhagia and if a small increase in my risk for breast cancer is what it takes for no babies and control of my blood faucet, well... i'll take that chance.
to the best of my knowledge, i have no other risk factors.
even if i did, like you, i would likely not find it a threat unless my doctor was concerned.
i started on the pill because my cycle was beyond irregular (i could go a few months between periods or just a week) and i was about to leave for college.
i’ve been on it for about 5 months and have had no ill-effects.
people tend to forget that the risk is slim even without taking bc.
being this is the internet, i'm sure i'll get crucified here - but there is always natural family planning - modern methods of monitoring female fertility and then - gasp - simply not having sex during those times.
inconvenient, yes.
but medically, perfectly safe.
and it does work for some - though it's not for everyone.
this article just gives more information - and nfp is just another option for those who wish to choose it - but it is a valid option that should be mentioned.
up to each person to know all the facts then decide based on their own situation.
so... babies or cancer... not an easy choice.
especially since having babies does not mean you'll never get cancer.
literally all forms of birth control have side effects.
none of them are safe.
literally no.
having a partner whose had a vasectomy has no side effects for women (unless in a very low chance that their procedure failed).
so, there is that.
i think the side effects of a vasectomy (or tubal/essure sterilization on a woman) would be that it's invasive/requires healing and is, for the most part, permanent.
for some of us, this isn't a problem, but sometimes communicating that is an issue (doctors won't believe that you just don't want babies) but that takes it completely off the table for most young people who are just looking for prevention until they want to start a family.
there are side effects for the man, such as potential pain while orgasming for months after the surgery.
i'd call that a side effect.
any surgery, even as ‘mild’ as a vasectomy, has side effects for the patient.
it usually comes in the form of general aches and pains during healing but there are side effects.
the effect on the partner has little matter.
at the moment, there are no perfect forms of bc.
the only one with a 100% effectiveness is abstinence.
the others all have some side effect and can fail.
[deleted] this is a story in the nyt.
sorry about your theory.
what're you talking about?
so bc has been out for 20+ years, and it's just now being linked to cancer?
yes, exactly.
it can take decades to determine correlations between medications and certain cancers, because certain cancers take decades to develop.
not exactly.
it’s been known there’s a link, but the pill was reformulated to reduce the risk.
this study mostly shows the risk is still there.
there’s not much to worry about because the risk is still very slim (only 13 more cases per 100,000).
as another commenter states, it also does take years to learn the long term effects of a medication, especially if it is reformulated/changed.
hormonal medication can also be extra complicated because hormones effect everyone differently.
this is one of the reasons you need to be open and honest with your doctor regarding medications.
this has only happened to me twice i hate when that happens.
the fire department started charging me every time to boot.
sounds like a sticky situation.
i'm sure the microwave surreptitiously recorded the whole thing.
i don't think he was "done" in 3 minutes.
this is a nj driver.
i'm not surprised.
i'm confused.
i thought they admitted it was accidental and he fell to his death, or is this a different one?
no that was a random local police chief or sheriff that said it might have been a vehicle.
as a bpa myself, i'm fairly sure he he had no idea how we work and track to determine if others were previously in the area this.
a local law enforcement official suggested they might have been run off the road by a tractor trailer since it’s been known to happen.
but border patrol has stated from the beginning that the two officers were assaulted and one was essentially beaten to death.
&gt; but border patrol has stated from the beginning that the two officers were assaulted and one was essentially beaten to death.
has the actual bp put out a statement saying that?
the only one i've seen is a quote from a union rep who represents the bp in no way at all.
nah border patrol has been saying since day one it was an attack, the media tried to spin it to say it was an accident.
who attacked him?
cartels smuggling in undocumented immigrants or drugs?
the article seems to suggest that one of several informants was a ‘coyote’ who smuggled people across the border, and that several of the people he smuggled were the ones who attacked the agents.
being that the article states they have names, destinations, a travel route, and even the make and model of the car the suspects were driving in, it’s very likely this is legit.
&gt; being that the article states they have names, destinations, a travel route, and even the make and model of the car the suspects were driving in, it’s very likely this is legit.
i'd hold off on that assumption.
this wouldn't be the first, or last, time that a confidential informant is full of shit.
at the very least, it shows the fbi believe it was an attack over a truck hit and run.
except two brothers were in mexico two days before they were arrested.
do you think illegals come over twice?
and especially after they killed a bp agent?
you can say illegal immigrants
we have treatments that stop bleeding already, but this actually means the body produces its own clotting factors, which is huge.
most haemophiliacs are on prophylactic treatments of recombinant (using animal cells to produce clotting factors) factor in order to prevent bleeds.
it's not fool proof and bleeds are still a common occurrence.
for me at least going a whole year without bleeds would be fantastic.
i think this calls for a cupa last time a royal prince was involved in stopping hemophilia it didn't end so well for the guy.
the royals will be pleased to hear this did he build a time machine and stop his ancestors from inbreeding?
that's not how haemophilia works.
like most genetic conditions inbreeding means that it stays within the gene pool but it's not the cause.
genetic mutations are just a part of life.
source: am a 1st generation haemophiliac whose parents are not related.
well alright alright alright....now they can get back to all that inbreeding that they so loved.
the things you do for that genius trait.
but he stressed that the russian government wouldn't be able to help them cheat since they aren't competing officially.... i watched the documentary "icarus" on netflix last night.. it's about the guy who broke the entire russian doping story.
if you're interested don't miss it.. it's quite a story.
i watched it and it was pretty lame.
the marketing called it the "greatest ever documentary" but it was just meh.
username checks out.
russian doper does not approve of icarus.
putin also would not stop individuals competing at the 2018 olympics from dying of polonium poisoning on their own account.
if you're going to repeat the same joke we've all heard a million times, at least put a little effort into it.
maybe the issue is that the half life of the joke is very short.... does the value of the joke deplete more or less quickly depending on the contents of the joke?
that is a broken question, the depletion of the joke is at an exponencial rate, at a half-life of its substance.
now its volume, the mass that we are concerned with and its value, is only the question of once preference.
like plutonium its only useful to thuse who want to use it.
*so no mutially exclusive veriables instead, he'll just have their families killed.
i would think the chance to take a gold away from another country could be just as sweet for him so why wouldn’t he?
it's not like it's a super bowl ring that guy can go suck a bag of dicks.
the hired goons he had silently standing behind him pounding their fists gave a different impression.
i thought you can't compete in the olympics unless you're doing so on behalf of a country, and if russia is banned doesn't that mean no russians allowed?
they would compete under the olympic flag - https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-suspends-russian-noc-and-creates-a-path-for-clean-individual-athletes-to-compete-in-pyeongchang-2018-under-the-olympic-flag they can go on their own but nothing about them can represent russia.
for example no flags on their uniforms or flown in the opening ceremony.
so what happens if they win a medal?
"some random shmuck won silver."
instead of actually adding to their countries score.
that just seems so weird.
human from planet earth wins!
damn, earth won all the medals again?
they'd participate under a neutral flag, with no anthem if i remember correctly.
the ioc made sure to stress that no matter how many russians go and medal, it will still show as 0 for the country as a whole maybe the "unified team" can make a comeback for this olympics but history will just show russia with an asterisk for any winners.
maybe there will be a story worthy of a movie about it later, like cool running's or miracle in ice.
kuwait athletes did it in 2016 and won a gold and bronze vladdy is just going to kill their parents.
or make them compete as ukraine's.
that's a stretch, first he'd have to recognize ukraine as a country.
oh they recognize ukraine.
at least the ukraine that was their puppet.
wouldn't it be grand, if the ioc just ignored the russian athletes?
no announcements for any of them, or any mention of who they are.
just impose a complete shutdown.
they get up on a podium to get a medal and receive... nothing.
they get as little camera time as physically possible without making the effort ridiculous.
it would be so beautiful.
did someone ask vlad what he would do?
why?
this isn't just any pathologist, it's dr. bennet omalu, the guy who discovered cte in nfl athletes, who will smith played in that movie.
that guy doesn't strike me as a guy that does a lot of lying, or one that's bad at his job.
when the movie came out, a lot of brain researchers were upset that he claimed to have discovered and named cte: http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/12/17/concussion-bennet-omalu-nfl/ &gt; in the pbs documentary “league of denial,” omalu also claims credit for discovering and naming the disease.
“name it a disease; give it a name.
present it as a disease; package it,” he said, explaining that he had taken a class in business school where they discussed how to create brand equity.
“‘chronic’ means long-term.
‘traumatic’ means it’s associated with trauma.
‘encephalopathy’ means a bad brain.
so i had both ends covered.” &amp;nbsp; &gt; at the time of webster’s autopsy, though, the disease had been known — and known by that name — for decades.
it's a very logical name, following an established pattern.
once you understand latin medical naming, the names of conditions like this are usually super obvious and usually follow that pattern.
so the fact that it was the "same name" does not mean much.
or maybe he'd heard the term somewhere before and it stuck subconsciously.
it's like everyone who screams when someone says christopher columbus discovered america.
maybe he wasn't the first european over here but when he discovered it, it stayed discovered.
columbus was a dick.
he lied and claimed he'd seen land the night before, after the morning watchmen spotted it and screamed out.
the man to spot land first was owed a bounty, of course.
do you have any idea how many historical figures were dicks?
or how many currently famous people are also dicks?
funny how racist assholes end up in the history books and become heroes for 3rd graders the world over, eh?
aye, hilarious.
"history is rarely made by reasonable men" this is true for all cultures.
columbus was a real piece of work even by 15th century standards though.
a lot of what we know about columbus is taken from a hit piece by a single author who had a hard on for trying to vilify europeans.
he took only accounts from columbus's men, awko hated columbus cause was a bit hard on his men, not allowing them to rape and such.
every man who was willing to do what hadn't been done was going to be driven and unapologetic.
it's why they did what they did.
of course they're gonna be dicks to some extent.
"stayed discovered" to white european leaders who were in the beginning stages of global colonization.
pretty sure it stayed discovered to the people that had been living there for generations tho.
e: i guess we are downvoting facts in favor of poor analogies today.
ight reddit it had been discovered many times over by many different cultures.
we have evidence norwegians fished our east coast, we've found chinese records indicating our land, old maps, etc etc.
the only reason it "stayed discovered" is because what you said -- there wasn't room in england for people and the surrounding lands were established.
they just didn't care to colonize it.
although i will say, people get very annoyed by hearing anything about the indigenous people.
also, the fact that you said "white" instead of just european can be seen as racist to some.
personally, i couldn't give two fucks about almost anything -- just showing you how the hive-mind here reacts to shit.
until california starts hanging the sheriffs departments out to dry, nothing will changed.
after seeing how it worked in my state, i think you've got to start with the sheriff's departments if you want change in law enforcement they are the bastion of good-old-boy politics that empowers the rest of the bad actors.
tulsa, oklahoma fucking decapitated it's sheriff's department after bad shit went down--and now every department in the state is really, really careful about shooting people.
go after the guys at the top, or nothing will change.
oklahoma city took the hint and dropped the hammer on one of their cops who was a serial rapist.
he's now serving 200+ years.
currently we have an officer going to trial for shooting a gun at someone who was threatening to light themselves on fire in an act of suicide look at how most of the ca sheriffs depts.
hand out ccws here and you will see how fucked it is.
in most cases you have to be a high dollar sheriff re-election donor to even get close to one.
santa clara and la county are two noteable ones who were caught doing this.
different laws and perks if you have $$$$ to donate, everyone else is fucked over.
funny how gun control enables that sort of shit.
and it's even more ironic that those same liberals constantly rail against police misconduct, when one of the very things toot their moral horn about enables the same police misconduct gun control has always been about disarming the poor minorities...the loopholes and exceptions are always available for the elite.
not letting felons and mentally unstable people have guns is about disarming the poor minorities?
when the system unfairly targets minorities for prosecution, yes.
if rich white kids went to jail for drugs at the same rate that poor white or black kids do, things might be different.
you think those kids driving mommys hand me down bmw smoke less weed or pop less molly?
be real.
while i agree drug charges do target as you say, i don't think taking gun rights away is the *goal* of that, it's just a side effect.
whats with the downvotes?
how is continuing slavery not insidious?
the gun control policies are only so strict in california(with the support of the nra i might add) because they were afraid of black people protecting themselves.
[and ronald reagan signed it into law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/mulford_act?wprov=sfla1).
not sure why i was downvotwd for being right.
but but but those scary pistol mods will threaten the children!
i ask this in all seriousness because i am dumb sometimes before coffee: how does gun control allow police misconduct?
because people cannot defend themselves you mean?
i doubt it would stop police misconduct really.
really the only thing that forces reform of police departments is the oversight of the feds... and i really doubt the current doj cares at all about corrupt police.
in fact they ended an important oversight program https://www.aclu.org/blog/mass-incarceration/smart-justice/jeff-sessions-guts-federal-oversight-policing-it-opens-door in a state like cali?
police run the show like 1960's teamsters if they have to.
if you want any reform done you'll have to attack the corruption at its source: police unions unions!
drink!
police oversight is fixed by federal programs, in a purely coincidental move, trump's doj ended such programs also a major reason why.
many of the programs started by previous administrations have been defunded by trumps administrations.
reforming from the federal level is much easier than doing it inside your own city.
my home town had a bad cop problem.
any attempts at reforms over the years were shot down by the unions because they had so much political power.
it took a major cover up, dead pedestrians, and a federal probe into the department to see any changes unions protecting their people is not shocking and if you get rid of a unions ability to do that it can cause a lot of unintended consequences, that's the reason feds have to be involved it's great, the left thinks unions are infallible, while the right refuses to oversee police creating a total lack of accountability.
neither side is actually correct, and both are empowering a police force who desperately need to be put in their place.
you need to look at it from a fresh perspective.
conservatives, be tough on crime.
ensure that the police aren't criminals.
liberals, don't empower a group that already holds all of the cards by allowing their out of control unions to continue pushing laws that eliminate accountability.
cops, it isn't an excuse to say "i just want to do my job and keep my head down" if you are going to cry about the perception of your career choice.
if your job is to enforce the law, that means you enforce the law whether the criminal wears a badge or not.
if you can't do that, then it's time to shut up because you know your profession is corrupt enough that you can't do the right thing, and the perception is deserved.
&gt; the left thinks unions are infallible damn good thing nobody ever made this claim then oh, yada yada yada, love those arguments from the point of pedantry rather than any attempt to think outside the bounds of the standard partisan garbage.
unions are a problem in city police departments.
the sheriff is an elected official with the usual sleaze that can entail.
but at the end of the day it *is* an elected position and voters could immediately clean house if they wanted to.
no police union can prevent an elected official like a sheriff from being ran out of office on a rail on corruption charges.
recapture the sheriff's department and you'll recapture your police.
a union can however, protect city cops.
"he was shot and killed by the officer.
the wounds show that he was running away and shot in the back."
"yeeeaaahhh, i'm going to change this to suicide."
"what?
the subject didn't have a gun, and the video shows that..." "such a tragedy, someone so young with so much to live for, you know?"
"please listen, the officer admitted that..." "s-u-i.. s?
how do you spell suicide?"
"..." "suiside by cop" is a legitimate form of suiside!
he fucked with the wrong pathologist how quaint...i'd be willing to be my entire 401k that nothing will happen.
possibly some paid leave, a "stern" talking to behind closed doors, a phony press release, laying low for a few days, and then business as usual for the police.
normally i would agree with you... this has all the makings of being different i really hope so!
for this to be different you need activist boots on the ground constantly harrying the bad guys with social and legal pressure.
make no settlements, give no quarter, drive them from office.
i don't see why.
it's another example of cops covering up their crimes, which we have an unlimited number of examples every day, but which never have any impact because quite simply a large portion of the public wants the police to be above the law, and wants them to beat and kill criminals at their discretion.
or worse, they actually just believe everything the cops say.
there are a lot of people who think that cops should just be able to judge dredd away all the bad guys, and will always, always support any attempt to shield cops from consequences.
the pathologist is something of a celebrity for his nfl cte stuff.
might not change much, but it gives a credible name to the claim.
did you see that it's dr. omalu?
i'm usually skeptical about scandals involving police departments seeing any justice, but his name will bring a lot more attention.
no, he fucked with the right pathologist long enough to make that pathologist quit.
the tampering will continue, and any new pathologist hired will know *exactly* what to write and how to write it when dealing with officer involved deaths.
the san juaquin sheriff's department *won*.
the truth, and public have *lost.
* you are usually correct.
but i hope and think you are wrong here it's good to have hope.
but it is bad to be deluded *by* hope.
i actually think something good is going to happen in this particular case only because of who the pathologist is.
it is not in his nature to let this go.. i am most certainly a "hope for the best, prepare for the worst" type of person.
how refreshing to find a couple of people willing to stand up for what's right, in the face of police corruption.
so the sheriff is going to jail?
if by "jail" you mean "paid administrative leave" then ... probably?
and if by "fine" you mean that's exactly how he'll be doing when he's promoted upon his return.
oh sweetie... my mom's boyfriend is in his late 80's.
he's got stories.
his various county sheriffs over the years embezzled in the 2000's, shook down dealers and sold drugs in the 80's and the 90's, and bootlegged liquor through the 30's and the 40's.
"all these small counties are full of crooks" who is the coroner?
in most places they don't even have to be medicly trained.
the one i met at was a retired cop.
"san joaquin county’s two forensic pathologists resigned in recent days over what they said was intolerable interference by sheriff-coroner steve moore."
if i am reading this right the sheriff is also the coroner.
correct - common arrangement in ca, unfortunately.
yeah.
i went to school with a guy whose dad was police, then ran for coroner, apparently it's similar salary compared to a sheriff, but i think it's more of an administrative rather than medical role.
this is hilarious.
i just don't understand why we still elect these positions.
only in america (i think.)
in canada our judges and coroners are appointed by and serve as non-partisan civil servants so that they're not politically biased.
sounds more like sandford.
the greater good... the greater good... another article about this alleges that the sheriff-coroner cut the hands off the bodies at the morgue for no reason.
[super weird.
](http://www.kcra.com/article/san-joaquin-county-medical-examiner-sheriff-cut-off-hands-at-morgue/14106094) once upon a time, i was a deputy sheriff in san joaquin county.
this doesn't surprise me.
hey that’s that cte nfl concussion guy will smith.
oh no, that's the *real* will smith, his first name is dr.!
this is why dallas happened you fucks.
this mother fucker needs to be locked up.
same newspaper that gave fresno cops john lang ip address.... &gt; john lang it appeared to me that john lang was developing some type of schizophrenia, but now with this revelation, i don't know what to believe.
sounds like the sheriff is selling body parts imo.
that's a shame.
joaquin pathologist was so good in gladiator and her.
the general rule is that physicians, unless they have moral integrity, become agents of the state.
in other words, politician bureaucrats, as a matter of practice, if allowed, will use physiciians as a means to an end.
umm no?
these people have devoted their entire adult lives to a single vocation and in most doctors cases, have sworn oaths to protect and heal.
so take your /r/conspiracy rhetoric else were although i do agree that /u/puffin_fan is incorrect in his/her statement, i don't believe /r/conspiracy is the right place for him/her for the following reasons.
* he/she never once mentioned alex jones as a credible source.
* he/she has not mentioned the je... "globalist" agenda.
* he/she did not bring up clinton's emails despite having no bearing on the current discussion.
i would suggest /r/conspiracyii for /u/puffin_fan as a better alternative to visit.
hes not saying most doctors abandon integrity.
he said that doctors without integrity become agents of the state and are used by politicians.
please read a little more closely before you rant and rave.
physicians, like any one else , can be influenced by offers of money, power, status, reward, and recognition.
in fact, physicians are generally more susceptible - and i'm not sure why, it may have something to do with problems in the medical admission process amd the medical schools themselves.
ackshually it's janitors.
they are the true agents of the state.
they have access everywhere, and are predisposed to espionage.
it's something in their dna.
plus they're made in a lab, which basically proves everything i've said.
even though what you say is true in theory, as of late doctors have become little more than pharmaceutical poison peddlers and those that don’t “conform” are black listed and loose their licenses.
i can’t remember her name but she lost her job as a doctor for treating patients with cheaper wholistic variants that once her peers found out they ostracized her because she wasn’t using a big pharma solution.
she isn’t the first nor will she be the last... it’s not always a conspiracy just because it seems inconceivable.
"as of late..." yah sure... doctors haven't really changed, but conspiracy theories have certainly gained a greater foothold in the midst of the internet driven post-truth culture we are currently dealing with.
our medical science is better than it has ever been and we are literally doing miraculous things that wouldn't have been possible 20 years ago, and you call it poison peddling.
yet inevitably you will of course seek treatment for your medical problems and never once be thankful that you aren't living in a time or place without modern medical science.
i thought the rule was: a doctor is just a serial killer with better parents.
"the population of nanking just before the japanese occupation was about 200,000. about a week before the japanese attack on nanking, on november 28, 1937, the head of the police department of nanking, mr. wan, announced at a press conference for foreigners, "about 200,000 people still live here in nanking."
five days after the japanese occupation, on december 18, 1937, the international committee for the nanking safety zone, which was a group of westerners remaining in nanking, announced that the population of the city was about 200,000. later, on december 21, the foreigners association in nanking referred to 200,000 as the population of nanking.
how could the japanese kill 300,000 citizens in a city that held only 200,000 people?
one month after the japanese occupation, many nanking citizens who had escaped the city came back to nanking, learning that peace had returned, and the population increased to about 250,000. there is a record that the japanese troops distributed food to that number of citizens.
on january 14, 1938, about one month after the japanese occupation, the international committee announced that the population of nanking had increased to about 250,000."
http://www2.biglobe.ne.jp/remnant/nankingm.htm edit: you've got a problem with historical, verifiable facts, people?
redditors don't like being reminded of axis atrocities.

"i usually make a sandwich and put in a couple of energy bars and maybe some fruit.
last night i must've mistaken my fridge glock for an apple.
honest mistake.." &gt;fridge glock well, looks like it's time to add another to the collection... &gt; fridge glock wouldn't it get all moldy?
not if it's in a zipglock bag.
get out.
just get out.
*points to the door* don't forget a siligat packet.
is glock.
is fine.
you have to keep a box of armed and hammered in the fridge next it to keep it fresh.
it’ll still shoot, though.
tsa: for when you are so bad at your job the only guns you can find are the ones you brought with you.
"mistakenly packed a gun in his lunch"- what the actual fuck.
this is not an acceptable excuse.
imagine saying that shit to a tsa agent at the airport.
pretty sure you or i would be facing serious charges.
this agent got caught red-handed trying to breach security and needs to be made an example of.
also, make him take his fucking shoes off.
and get his junk checked, then go into secondary screening, with addition bag check, where things go missing this actually happens more often than you think.
no charges are every usually filed.
a lot of the times, it is a honest mistake no, you'd be questioned and if it were an honest mistake it'd be up to the local tsa manager to prosecute or just let you go.
this guy probably made his lunch at 2 am for his morning shift at 4. ever been forgetful at the wee hours of the morning?
sometimes when i’m forgetful i miss a deadline at work.
or fail to call a friend on their birthday.
i have yet to accidentally grab my glock when intending to make a tuna sandwich for tomorrow’s lunch.
man you really love the tsa huh yikes with a gun?
!?
absolutely not.
there is no way that this was some flakey mistake.
if it were a can of beer instead of a can of soda, maybe.
but a gun?
nope.
it's his job!
if he's making mistakes like this, then he should not be working security.
actually, it would be up to the local police.
the tsa has neither the discretion nor the authority to make an arrest.
obviously we need a tsasa who watches the watchmen watch watchers?
rolex mechanics.
then who watches the watchmen watch watcher watchmakers?
... wtf is a watch?
tsa are the same people from the dmv... just with epaulettes.
incompetent.
the people at the dmv are much nicer and they don't grab my vag.
i wasn't aware the dmv employed former national guardsman, air force air traffic controllers, and bachelor educated college graduates.
it does.
the dmv is pretty indiscriminate in their hiring, as long as you have decent history with previous employers and aren’t a convicted felon.
the groups of people you listed are pretty good people to hire because they are seen by the public to have good work ethic and authority, excluding college graduates.
college grads are also usually recently educated and are more up to date on technology, which helps in an aging workforce.
i'm not really good at the odd holidays.
was it take your slaughter to work day?
honey its getting close to midnight and all the myths are in town matter of fact, you've got two minutes to midnight... the hands that threaten dooooooom how is this news?
who cares its all theater anyway funny.
how many terrorist incidents have occurred that involved aviation since 2001 in the us.
one in 2003. how about the rest of the world?
a dozen.
so where is their "theater?"
how many before?
i can use your logic to say i prevent the soviet union from reforming.
i have a rock that repels tigers.
the range on that thing must be huge!
it's working all the way over here.
how many terrorists has the tsa caught?
they finally found one!
he just brought the wrong iron supplement.
honest mistake.
hey guess what.
it’s none of our business.
wonder what the 450 million dollars was really for.
money laundering 101 we are not far from the billion dollar art number.
i'm curious how far this appreciation-depreciation scam can keep going.
it's bizarre.
this sold for like 50 million http://i.imgur.com/bkzsokg.jpg god, what a waste of a perfectly good wall.
no, no, you buy the wall to get the stripe.
blind reaction here: what's preventing anyone from painting that?
semi-serious response from someone who isn't an art historian: barnett newman (the painter of the above) is a pretentious twit, but not necessarily an insignificant painter.
with works like this, context is important: not only its immediate context in the artist's career, but its historical context.
newman would feed you some crap about how 'sublime' it was (he didn't know what the word meant) or how bold he was, or affix some preposterous title.
there is also an implicit irony in a moderately important painter doing something like this: it leads the viewer to ask questions like yours ('where's the skill or value in this?')
that are usually answered only with recourse to the fame of the artist.
ultimately, though, it usually comes down to two things: 1) do you like the picture, and why?
2) do you think it's a important picture, and why?
i've actually been mulling this over all day, so here's my second response: while you, or i, or anything else could grab some blue paint and splash up someone that was really close to this, there is an argument that we wouldn't be able to tell the difference between our shoddy painting and a similar but more refined one.
by analogy, my wife's a classically-trained composer, but she's written a few pieces of art song that play on pop, jazz, and other musical genres.
the pop-ish ones, for example, sound *like* pop songs, but they're way more complex than that.
you could throw them into the 'top 40', and they wouldn't sound out of place-- just kind of momentarily unusual, sort of like if pitbull suddenly starting german.
but beyond that are levels of musical sophistication that are basically inaudible to most people who don't have a deep understanding of music theory.
similarly, the jazz-y pieces sound like jazz, but there's no improvisation: just really complex, fully-notated passages that sound improvisatory (and drive pianists up the wall).
barnett newman, i'm sure, would say something similar: that the difference between his 'white zip on blue' and yours or mine depends upon craft that you and i simply don't appreciate.
as such, when you or i say, 'why we could do that!'
we would be (he would claim) exposing our ignorance.
it's basically a giant post-modernist bluff.
this is art because i say it's art, and if you don't get it, you're uncool.
the trick is knowing whether to call the bluff or not, and how.
you could by ten babe ruth's jerseys and a used car for that kind of money.
it's funny because while i don't think that's worth 50 million dollars, there's a good chance that i can appreciate the artistic value it does have much more than someone who is willing to pay 50 mil for it.
i know this isn't him, but i love rothko's work, and this is certainly evocative of his that.
i wonder how much the mona lisa would go at auction for (and if there is any paintings worth more).
last supper is the only thing i can think of mona lisa might be worth more out of sheer notoriety, although i agree the last supper *should* be worth more.
if it was laundered to buy all the cheetas and have a sweet cheetah army guarding his compound i’d be okay with it.
however i doubt this is the case.
how exactly do you launder money like this https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/arts/design/has-the-art-market-become-an-unwitting-partner-in-crime.html http://www.hopesandfears.com/hopes/culture/art/214699-guide-to-laundering-money-art https://www.quora.com/how-does-one-launder-money-using-art-work the nyt is being pretty charitable with that 'unwitting'.
most of the time, there is full awareness.
saudi princes do not need to money launder.
their bank is underground... it's the last da vinci painting in the open market.
once art goes to the public (i.e., museums), it rarely ever goes back into private ownership.
for the ridiculously wealthy, that matters.
ever been to a museum and noticed little blurbs in the descriptions next to art that states something along the lines of bequeathed or donated by random person?
those random people left art to the public upon their deaths.
(and occasionally in the uk, to pay taxes.)
the new approach is to hang privately-owned works in public spaces to increase their value.
a priceless da vinci painting.
you all do realize those aren't cheap at all right?
the list of people that could do this is so exceedingly small that it couldn't have been that big a mystery.
obviously when you get to the s for saud part it gets a little tricky but really, those cats need to fund their tyrannical and terroristic whims some how.
some context: &gt; over the last 25 years, i've been amazed at the rise in prices and the sheer volume of the art market.
**100 million dollars** for a picasso removes the work from public currency.
it says, "look, i can only belong to the super rich."
and all other picasso's are just the same.
this alienation of the work from the common viewer is actually a form of spiritual vandalism -- a cultural obscenity.
robert hughes, *the new shock the new*, 2004 i would strongly recommend the above documentary (a follow-up to hughes' wonderful series on 20th century art, *the shock of the new*) and *the mona lisa curse* (2008) which expands on the problems of the 21st century art market.
probably looking for tp for his bunghole.

i am in canada living off of 438 dollars for the month, payed my rent and had 38 bucks (gone now, have to buy food), while this guy just plays with hundreds of millions.

yay canada.

those panama papers are so damning, and not a ripple in the world.
its hard for us to be shocked anymore so?
did anything come out of the exposure of panama papers?
was her death all in vain?
edit: assumed people's gender incorrectly.
i'm a local.
the sort of people who have been charged with her murder are more likely to be drug/oil/fuel/human smugglers and traffickers than panama-sort tax evaders.
i mean, you wouldn't expect panama-sort tax evaders to do their own dirty work, would you?
agreed.
however they would not use a disorganised gang in marsa which leaves telecom records everywhere, either.
edit: marsa being a notorious harbour town where criminals seemingly started aggregating.
maybe the contractor hired subcontractors?
the media today reported that these guys used their personal mobile phone to top up the "anonymous" phone they used to send the sms that triggered the bomb from... to think that we lost our greatest journalist due to the actions of someone like that is so infuriating it was she not he .
yes and no, the story didn’t get much traction from the msm, especially because it didn’t have anything to do with trump.
sad.
&gt; especially because it didn’t have anything to do with trump.
sad.
you could search "panama papers trump" into any search engine and find out that is a lie.
why do people enjoy lying so blatantly and proudly?
are you sure you’re not talking about the paradise papers?
if you’re going to be a pedant and take jokes seriously, at least be right.
http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trumps-first-appearance-panama-papers-uncovered-722266 seems like this is changing as the panama papers continue to be dissected.
doesn't it physically hurt to have to lie so blatantly?
did it get alot of mainstream media attention?
or did it have something to do with trump?
i fail to see the lie, educate me.
it got plenty of mainstream media attention.
you can just do a quick google search for "panama papers" and see articles from last year talking in detail about the scandal from places like nytimes, nbc news, wired, the atlantic, the guardian, usa today... i could probably just pick a "msm" company at random and find an article they wrote about it.
so...yes, the line about "the story didn’t get much traction from the msm" is clearly a lie.
in comparison to other leaks of the magnitude, it was lackluster, especially it’s lack of staying power in the cultural zeitgeist but if you want to be pedantic because i made a flipant joke about how self centered and narrow minded the msm is, i’ll concede that journalists did talk about it.
it likely didn't blow up because there weren't any specific crazy revelations about us citizens, at least from everything i have read.
some that were in there were already convicted of fraud, so there wasn't a lot to latch onto over the long term.
"known fraudsters show up in leak around shady business practices" isn't exactly a headline that's going to grab people for weeks on end.
edit: not to mention, showing up in the leaks doesn't mean you did anything that is actually illegal or even unethical.
you are absolutely right.
which is why i answered yes and no to the original question, and joked about how it had nothing to do with trump aka american news.
does that make sense now?
a 17 foot snake.
that's just not right.
all total they caught nealy 1 mile of snake (5000').
creepy shivers me... you want shivers?
imagine how many miles of snake they didn't catch.
now go lay on the grass and take a nap.
there are bigger snakes out there.
are we in any danger, due to climate change, of a snakenado ?
florida has been for a while thanks to people dumping pet pythons and the state being a utopia for them despite them being an unnatural species to the area.
snakenado is pretty much an inevitably should a water spout happen.

yeah, the doctor that delivered me said the same thing right after telling my mother that i was a boy.
'snakenado' kind of happened already since this whole issue dates back to hurricane andrew wiping out a reptile breeding facility.
snakerricanes are different that's one big fucking nope rope.
terrifying.
17 feet of danger noodle danger noodle stealing that for my shitty garage band name and self titled debut album.
the problem isn't so much that pythons in the everglades are invasive, idiots have put different species there before.
the problem is that they may become dominant.
right now, the natural dominant species is the american alligator, and there are plenty of documented cases of pythons eating them.
fuck those snakes.
alligators are people food!
i once saw a video of an alligator killing a python by clawing its way out of the snake, after being swallowed.
seems like a pretty even dual for apex predator spot.
maybe at a point if the python populations keeps growing, they will impact the alligator population by eating too many of them ... but at this point the alligator population has grown (recovered) to the point that hunts are being authorized to reduce it.
thats where she went... florida.
the same guy got a bigger one in 2013, 18'8".
&gt;“usually, the hunters will then take the snakes and make products with their skin.

try not coming up with nonsense gas formulas only for california the only thing better than them having to pay high gas prices is the upcoming federal tax law where the state taxes fuck over the state homeowners tough luck.
get what you vote for californians i see a few salty downvotes.. people don't like the truth yeah, because gas prices in california have a lot to do with the fire in ventura county.
because state propositions affect federal tax laws.../s this guy is kinda off topic and also wrong.
taxes in california have nothing to do with price gouging, and gas prices in state are not high either... people don't want to know the truth when they have something to defend.
the only thing people can defend in this context is tax increasion, which doesn't take a genius to realize would increase prices.
price gouging actually serves a legitimate economic purpose.
politicians don’t math.
[high prices incentivize consumers to purchase only what they need to satisfy their highest-valued wants, and leave the rest for others.
](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adammillsap/2017/09/07/price-gouging-laws-not-hurricanes-empty-stores-shelves/) i'm not seeing any math.
&gt; while the intention is admirable, the reality is that instead of plentiful supplies at low prices, these laws give us long lines and empty shelves.
1. they actually have the nerve to suggest that avoiding a long line is a valid reason to condemn the lower class to death and 2. empty shelves is an indicator that people are getting what they need, you dumb asshole.
&gt; the absence of any specific definition of gouging likely discourages any price increases, because the vaguest laws are those least exploited.
has this been true, in your experience?
in anyone's?
&gt; it’s not clear that raising the price by such a modest amount to increase the likelihood water would be there for the people who needed it deserved the label “price gouging” and the scorn that accompanies it.
fucking hell.
think about what they're saying when they say "people who needed it."
did the poor people who could afford the water not need it?
of course they did.
what they mean is "people who could afford the marked up price."
this scheme is a cold, calculated extraction of capital that dooms the poorest of us - the weakest of us - to a new tier of misery, if not death.
there is literally no altruism involved.
&gt; (dumb as shit paragraph about how you can complain about price gouging via their tip line or social media, as if that's a valid, immediate way to combat it) that's right.
it's on *you* to keep these guys in check.
it's your responsibility.
&gt; if water is $1.79 per bottle instead of $0.50, it might not make sense to use it for trivial things, like watering your bernie sanders chia pet.
the actual "trivial things" they're referring to - and those most affected by this twisted rationale - are "everyone below the poverty line."
&gt; meanwhile, high prices incentivize producers to increase supply.
funny, i always thought demand did that.
&gt; moreover, while price-gouging laws keep prices down, it’s not clear they reduce costs.
literally no citation or proof to the contrary given.
just doubt.
you seem extremely confused, but i love your enthusiasm!
i believe i've found a new go-to phrase!
honestly, in my view, the market should decide.
if it's priced too high it won't sell.
it can only be priced as high as it's worth to consumers.
it should not only be legal, but encouraged.
consumers should spend money it's better for the economy, but most importantly the better for me.
mua hahah muahahahahha.
unpopular position - i'm ok with price gouging during disasters.
i think it is a good and natural thing.
here's why.
it is a matter of economics and maximizing the benefit to society.
when demand sky rockets because a hurricane is coming, prices naturally go up.
those who did not plan ahead, buying plywood before the emergency, will pay more now, and that willingness to pay (demand) drives up the price equilibrium point.
this is normal, and it has a positive consequence.
the higher price means that sellers are motivated to increase supply (for profit).
they can pay extra to have more of the goods shipped in, despite the additional cost, and still be profitable ... and they will do so for profit.
now trucks of [whatever - plywood, water, batteries] stream into the state, warehouses in other states are emptied, maybe product is flown in ... and more people get the product than would have gotten it had the price been artificially kept down.
more water/plywood/batteries = lives saved.
you have to remember that even in gouging, the transactions are voluntary.
each party to the transaction is making a judgment that at the given (high) price, they want to make the trade.
anti-gouging laws take away freedom of both parties ... including the freedom of the buyer to pay what they would pay for the product.
if i failed to plan ahead and was faced with a choice of paying $10 a bottle for water, or not getting water (because it would be sold out), i would be very unhappy with a law that values my dollars above my well being.
shouldn't i be allowed to decide what is more important - the dollars in my wallet, or water in my family's mouths?
in other words, i can decide for myself if the price is worth it, better than a government deciding for me.
and by letting the market (the people collectively) set its own price, overall benefit is maximized.
we have anti-gouging laws because (1) people don't understand economics; and (2) politicians can score points pretending to care about the little guy.
it is dump policy.

at this point i am calling it: the university needs to fuck off.

hazing?!
at a university!?
what is this world coming to!?
next you're going to tell me college students get drunk every weekend.
it would help if actual hazing was involved.
i get the emotional trauma of being forced to drink smirnoff ice is overwhelming and all but the university needs to fuck off.
i've been "iced" before and i'm still trying to get over the agonizing chest pain from all the gas it gave me.
*‘smashing smirnoff ice vodka bottles against a statue of the roman emperor marcus aurelius’ ‘team members also told the school paper that they were made to drink mixtures of tabasco sauce and vodka'* whoa let's shut this place down it's out of control!

what i find most amazing is that a person with this kind of status has such an unrefined sense of humour.

excuse me.

at what point does the rest of the world say fuck the us and does their own thing while the us sinks into its worst depression ever?
when their wood stops being so soft xd when they can take on russia and china, i.e never.
we run this shit.
we have to cut back on canadian lumber imports to make room for more russian lumber imports, which have increased 42% this year.
this is pretty much it.
decreasing canadian softwood doesn't create an increase in us softwood production; it just shifts the imports elsewhere -- in this case, russia.
tough for the us trade body; the wto and various other official organizations already ruled that there's nothing wrong with how canada manages softwood lumber.
for those not in the know, in canada, most of the coniferous forest is owned by the country as a whole, not by private enterprise.
the country then leases out plots of land to private industry for managed logging.
us politicians/trade interests look at this and cry "unfair!"
because in the us, property is almost all held privately, and this increases all the costs involved in managing the resource.
nafta basically did a tit-for-tat agreement, where some industries (like steel) ended up going mostly to the us, and other industries (like softwood lumber) ended up going mostly to canada.
now that nafta's up for renegotiation/the scrap heap, all the lobbyists are coming out of the woodwork to bring up the old arguments to pull all of the industries back inside the us, ignoring the fact that this will cause massive ripple effects in other parts of the economy.
russian lumber which uses a lot of north korean labor, essentially in slavery conditions.

from an american, i say to you man, good job.
you can rest now.
if you wish to continue, do so.
you've earned your wings my friend (not actually a friend, it's just a phrase... you get it) omar's story needs to be made more public.
the word hero is do overused but it's definitely applicable to him.
i hope he's one day able to return to mosul and teach young iraqis of all faiths in the schools there.
he's an amazing role model for patriotism and courage.
holy shit that was an unimaginable burden to bear.
:( did he hack their bitcoin account?
did you read the article?
what do you think this is?
no one reads articles here.
what article?
i didn’t réalisé you can click on it and read
there (in 1f.)
was no atmospherical release of radioactivity since the unit 3 cleaning operation of the top floor in afair 2013/14 so they, ja, need to check less because we know now which fields are bad, not so bad and free of contamination all agricultural products for the export still get checked with a zero tolerance policy (no detectable levels/ kg.)
this is what causes the great san diego migration to mexico in 2018.
for the confused they attached a bomb to her car and set it off call me an idiot, but for a minute i thought they sent her a text message which made her phone explode.
that’s honestly what the headline implies, so you’re not alone.
seriously, how the fuck are you supposed to interpret *'with text message bomb'*?
terrible bait it's arguably good bait since it made more people want to click the article to find out more.
edit: meant "good" as in relation to "effective".
i don't like [yellow journalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yellow_journalism) either which is currently a huge blight on mainstream media.
click bait: journalists kill reditors with click bait title bomb.
reality: click bait title bombs according to reditors.
redit is my favorite interwebs site.
this is reddit.
we don't actually read articles, just talk about them maybe it said tap here for carexplosion.exe; and they thought it was a joke.
sending explosion..... maybe it'll scare some people to not answer their phone while driving.
"text 3210 if you want to kill your victim.
text 3211 if you just want to scare the crap out of them."
im recently playing hitman and that is a legit tactic in it.
wasn't there something like this in gta v?
call a number to explode a ceo's head?
to be fair, you actually fuck with the hardware in some way.
don't exactly remember what you do though.
put a bomb on it?
at the time you don't know it's a bomb though.
yeah i remember now, you were supposed to crash the ifruit stock by messing up their ifruit phone launch.
little did you know... “yo girl stop blowin up my phone” i thought it was a note 7 hey there it's me your assassin.
"; [[uidevice currentdevice] explode]; right?
i was like, holy shit!
technology is amazing!
it still is but like, not as much that’d be some arrow level technological bullshit.
so, they didn't kill anyone with a text message.
they killed with a bomb.
you wouldn't say, "they killed with a remote detonator."
"death by pressure applied to a pistol's trigger."
journalist killed by assassin using his fathers sperm.
the assassin used the sperm to get born and then 28 years later bought a gun and killed the journalist with it.
journalist killed by big bang.
technically accurate in this case.
"death by forearm muscles used to stab with knife" what if you beat someone to death with a remote detonator?
i'll have "sarcastic questions we were all going to ask" for 300 it's the daily double!
[removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] yes, i didn't think it was possible to text message a bomb...mainly because of the file size; plus it would definitely exceed my data plan!!
"why isn't it going off?"
"he has shitty service."
you wouldn't download a bomb not on purpose, but if it was in the google play store, i guarantee my 5yo would manage it.
why are people so mystified by stuff like this?
they just unwired the speaker for the ringer and hooked the leads up to an electronic igniter instead.
it's a deadass simple ied... i don't know why the paper didn't just call it an ied.
because then it wouldn’t be clickbaity enough.
that's a bingo!
the speaker isn't used, not enough voltage.
the vibration motor leads are used.
they send at least 3 volts to the motor.
toss on a relay to a larger battery attached to an electrically triggered blasting cap and set the phone to silent.
when it vibrates, or would have vibrated, it sends an electrical signal to the relay, relay turns on more powerful battery, blasting cap goes off, einstein gets a hard on and things become catastrophically rearranged.
til how to make an entry level detonator, thank you reddit.
i am now on a list.
&gt;the assassins who killed panama papers journalist daphne caruana galizia used a fatal text message sent from a boat out at sea those are meticulous precautions, yet the government was able to make arrests in a timely manner.
the three being held have prior records.
this sounds like a hired hit.
&gt;prosecutors have not released a motive for the killing.
interesting.
&gt;the slain journalist was most famous for using information in the panama papers leaks to allege illicit activity between the inner circle of maltese prime minister joseph muscat and the ruling family of azerbaijan.
that might have been it.
and there's something else: the dude didn't top up his freaking burner.
it didn't have minutes for the call.
he got caught because he had called asking for more money on that phone.
and then they found the phone.
but they got semtex.
it's the stupid assassin's that you hear about.
the really good ones i'm sure act on a decently regular basis and leave no trace.
this was someone bargain hunting for hitmen i'm sure lol it's the good assassinations you hear about, and the bad assassins.
yeah but when you hear about the good assassinations they are accidents, disappearances, or suicides.
my god, throw the fucker away -- use it for literally this one thing only and then toss that fucker in the ocean.
reminds me of the wtc bombing in the 90s, same thing, went to all this trouble, meticulous planning to pull it off then they go back to get the deposit they put on the rental truck they used.
to get back like $200 or something.
that's like next-level-crazy-stupid source?
i would say the semtex is proof enough a state actor was involved.
where the hell is someone going to get that?
edit: article now says it was initially thought to be semtex but was actually tnt.
plz source stop editing this, so i don’t look dumb.
not really,semtex was widely exported, shouldn't be a problem to get it on the black market.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semtex &gt;the new explosive was widely exported, notably to the government of north vietnam, which received 14 tons during the vietnam war.
**however, the main consumer was libya; about 700 tons of semtex were exported to libya between 1975 and 1981 by omnipol.
** very likely a lot of that stuff landed on the black markets after ghaddafi was removed.
the fall of libya will have repercussions for generations.
i mean its not like libya wasn't a one stop clearing house for terrorists prior to gaddafi falling.
he worked with pretty much any extremist group you care to name.
he was not a good man, but he kept his house in order.
toppling him was not pragmatic.
google [libya slave market](https://www.google.com/search?q=libya+slave+market) for more of the aftermath.
nation-building adventurism.
thanks, france.
&gt; he was not a good man, but he kept his house in order.
he had already lost almost half his house by the time the airstrikes started.
the **best** gaddafi could hope for was a grinding victory after half a year of civil war, followed by quadrupling down on terror in an attempt to hold down his shattered country.
more likely, he'd end up like late-90s saddam, with a third of the country effectively in eternal revolt.
helping the rebels topple him made things worse, but not helping the rebels topple him would have also made things worse.
you just need to choose between [death flights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/death_flights) and slave markets.
hey hey, before you blame france, us brits got involved too.
cant blame every fuck up on the french.
no _true_ englishman would ever proclaim such a thing!
everything is the french's fault, of course!
no true englishman would ever say they weren’t involved with colonialist nation building though, so it’s sort of a double bind.
american here.
i’ll chalk it up to our fault.
it usually is a lot of the fuck-ups us brits did was to piss off either the french or the spanish whilst lining the pockets of the elite, not much has changed.
good thing that the americans don't have to worry about that happening.
nobody there would ever start a war just to line the pocket of the elite libya has had a long tradition with slave trades before.
in fact, their enslavement of americans is what caused us to come out of our isolationist shell and start invading countries.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_barbary_war "to the shores of tripoli" but not to mississioppli...when in doubt, send the marines!
from the tripoli ambassador after being told to stop taking our ships and enslaving our citizens.... &gt;it was written in their koran, that all nations which had not acknowledged the prophet were sinners, whom it was the right and duty of the faithful to plunder and enslave; and that every mussulman who was slain in this warfare was sure to go to paradise.
he said, also, that the man who was the first to board a vessel had one slave over and above his share, and that when they sprang to the deck of an enemy's ship, every sailor held a dagger in each hand and a third in his mouth; which usually struck such terror into the foe that they cried out for quarter at once.
christ on a cracker jack.....we've been dealing with this shit for how long?
that was 1786 humans have been dealing with this shit for like 150,000 years.
just didn't use to write it down much.
slaves were being traded in and through libya even while qaddafi was in power.
perhaps they were not as open faced about the trade under qaddafi, but the trans-saharan slave trade has been ongoing for over 2000 years libya has been home to slavery for a thousand years.
this isn't new, what is new is cameras catching it and showing it.
you should certainly watch documentary "hypernormalization", because libya was one of the biggest scapegoats and showcases of how great west is dealing with problems on middle-east.
when in reality, biggest problem was and still is syria.
omnipol couldn't sound like a more insidious organization i'm not so sure.
the line between black books wet work and international gangsterism is razor thin.
there's not much the cia can do with regards to this stuff that an unscrupulous billionaire couldn't, and the panama papers tagged a good chunk of the wealthiest and most unscrupulous people in the world.
i dunno, the ira?
isis?
[semtex has been pretty popular with the terrorists.
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semtex) they may not have released the motive because the killers didn't do it because of the maltese-azerbaijan revelations, but because they were hired.
it seems like an important distinction that someone else is culpable.
they let them off on bail.
you'd think something this organized and deadly would be grounds for holding them without bail at least for the flight risk.
they could be being used as bait.
&gt;the slain journalist was most famous for using information in the panama papers leaks to allege illicit activity between the inner circle of maltese prime minister joseph muscat and the ruling family of azerbaijan.
a vincent muscat was arrested as well.
family or common azerbaijani name?
not azerbaijani, but a common name, yes.
&gt;&gt; prosecutors have not released a motive for the killing.
&gt; interesting.
when you don't want to fall victim to a text message bomb.
it's mostly because the motive for hired killers is hard to prove.
coming up with a theory for why hired killers murder someone is easy.
but if you want to prove motive, you basically need a trail of evidence leading to whoever gave the assignment.
that's a big part of the reason why hitmen are so difficult to catch and prosecute if they aren't caught in the act.
no provable motive, no link to the victim.
is 'semtext' trademarked, or can i have that?
copyright, patent pending for those curious, the panama papers revealed a metric shit-ton of corruption, money laundering, tax evasion, theft, etc.
from thousands of officials and wealthy people worldwide including in the us.
except it hasn't led to shit.
because even though we watch the watchmen, we don't have adequate means to punish them.
i think it's because they control the punishment.
i wonder what's going to happen to those that hijacked our economy in 2007 they get rich?
no!
that one guy......one single guy....got arrested.
justice?
*by the way the number is up to about 30 now, last i saw.
i think it was more like 30 people got arrested, but none of them were major bank execs so justice was never served.
many scapegoats.
feelsbadman i still wonder that 10 years later.
oh they'll be getting their punishment all right, we're about to cut their taxes.
they won't have like any taxes left by the time this new tax reform goes through.
we will generously give all the taxes to those upity grad students and slothful average income households.
no more white collar crime to worry about from big businesses, move along now.
&gt;adequate means to punish them i belive the us has something called the second amendment.
we probably don't care as much as venting online for a bit and then forget about reading it in the first place after a few cute animal pictures.
but imagine if the panama papers revealed the person responsible for loot boxes.... in iceland it did.
i'm happy to know that there's at least one functioning democracy on earth.
can iceland please spread democracy to others, but without the whole 'invade and install x' thing?
we would need educated voters instead of vapid consumer voters though.
use it as a model, and spread it to your country!
become an active citizen!
that's what sets it apart from other countries, i think, it's citizens are *really* active.
(easier with such a small population, of course).
but we have to find ways of engaging people in our countries too.
only by making the citizens active can we have real democracies.
i'm not.
one isn't enough.
it will never be enough until all people work with a government that fears them.
because it'd require governments to punish themselves, and that very rarely happens uuuuuuh, it caused the entire political order of pakistan to turn upside down.
in pakistan it ousted their corrupt pm.
and in iceland and i think australia it has effects.
just because it didn’t affect the us doesn’t mean it’s irrelevant in pakistan it did.
when the printing press was invented it didn't "lead to shit" right away.
even the medieval shake-ups that we associate it with took some decades.
but a few hundred years down the line the world is an inconceivably different place.
the information revolution brought on by the internet is just like that.
the people who benefit from the current order will flex their muscle to keep it, just like they always have, and when they're successful in the short term we'll say "nothing is going to change", but the writing on the wall is there, and the panama papers are part of it.
iceland got pretty well shaken up.
bankers were imprisoned &amp; the prime minister resigned.
more of a plop than a splash in global terms, but still, it is something.
and guess how many of them went to prison?
if you guessed, "not very many at all," step right up and claim your prize.
can i store my prize in an offshore account?
that's because most, if not all of the information leaked, didn't demonstrate illegal actions by those involved.
it showed us how the rich and powerful store their money discretely in offshore companies through legal channels.
if you want to know more about it read a great book [the panama papers](https://www.walmart.com/ip/the-panama-papers/55739862?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;selectedsellerid=0&amp;adid=22222222227095608642&amp;wmlspartner=wmtlabs&amp;wl0=&amp;wl1=g&amp;wl2=c&amp;wl3=212745727563&amp;wl4=pla-344810170073&amp;wl5=9073503&amp;wl6=&amp;wl7=&amp;wl8=&amp;wl9=pla&amp;wl10=8175035&amp;wl11=online&amp;wl12=55739862&amp;wl13=&amp;veh=sem)- it illustrates a lot of the major players who were exposed by the leak.
i’m still only a bit through the book, but david cameron’s career was essentially ruined.
there have been several argentine and brazilian politicians put under investigation for corruption.
it also confirmed suspicions that putin is the wealthiest man in the world by a substantial margin.
some people believe that lowering the top tax rate would keep money in countries; but it doesn’t matter so long as those able to hire the best lawyers can pay zero tax in panama, or whatever country offers the haven panama does including bono including emma watson including lewis hamilton that was the paradise papers (which bono was again caught up in) including the creator of dragon ball, akira “still fucking got it after 30 goddamn years” toriyama.
including probably everyone who has a lot of money.
*yeah but who cares?!
football players are kneeling!!1!
* "seven other men, all of them maltese, were released on bail as authorities continue the investigation into those already charged, who all have previous criminal records."
so you can participate in an organized assassination of a journalist, and still get bail?
and according to https://rsf.org/en/ranking (reporters without borders), malta is still at number 47... kudos to true reporters everywhere.
and thank you daphne caruana galizia!
i think it is more that you can be arrested on suspicion of being a participant in the assassination of a journalist and still get bail, which seems correct to me.
if it was conspiracy charges maybe but bail on a murder charge involving explosives... smh i totally feel you, but in an "innocent until proven guilty" society this is a unfortunate side effect.
the emotional side of me absolutely agrees with you, but you can't pick and choose which types of suspects receive due process.
all or nothing.
yep.
at least in the us, bail is only really withheld when the person is a flight risk, or it's believed that they'll be dangerous to society in the meantime.
in other words, you don't keep them locked up unless you legitimately believe that they'll have the resources to flee after posting bail, or you're afraid that the serial murderer will go murder another person while out.
hell, prior to the 1980's, federal law only allowed them to withhold bail if you were a flight risk.
it wasn't until the mid '80s that the "or an imminent danger to the community" part was added.
this opened it up so violent offenders, repeat offenders, crimes with especially high maximum sentences, etc could be held without bail.
and even then, there is a meeting with a judge specifically to decide whether or not bail can be withheld - the judge needs to classify them into one of those specific groups in order for bail to legally be withheld.
so, in this case, (at least in the us,) they absolutely could be held without bail; they're all repeat offenders of violent crimes, and could legitimately pose a risk to the community if released on bail.
but, considering the fact that malta will have different laws (and that the judge could very well be one of those corrupt people the reporter was reporting on,) it's not really surprising that they're out.
it's a shame.
she and all the others who worked on them did a great service to us all releasing the panama papers.
they knew the dangers they would face and still did it.
it's very admirable.
she didn’t release or was involved in the release of the panama papers.. she was a journalist that searched and found information against the maltese government inside the panama papers like every journalist out there.
the headline is extremely misleading.
she has also been ‘investigating’ on the maltese mafia and their crimes for years, so her death might be completely unrelated to the papers.
given that information, why was she a target for an assassination?
was she still a key player or potentially just an easy person to use as a message.
probably because of the stuff she was publishing about maltese government, discovered trough the panama papers.
she was a highly respected journalist, could be both.
rip daphne galizia michael hastings serena shim robert stevens chauncey bailey so many... these are dangerous days to be a truth-teller.
you dropped this &gt; , no no, that's only one name.
rip mr. so many lol, i actually started to read it as one name and was very confused for a moment.
no one calls esteban julio ricardo montoya de la rosa ramirez a thief!
no one has the time to!
many times over to add linebreaks to a comment, you need to either use two linebreaks to create paragraph break, as such: &gt;paragraph &gt;paragraph or use two spaces followed by a linebreak to create a regular linebreak, as such: &gt;line &gt;line (the difference between the two methods is that the first one has a bit more space between lines than the second method does) it will stop when society makes it even more dangerous to be a corrupt politician this right here.
no consequences they face are strong enough to deter anyone else from trying.
the reward well outweighs the risk of being corrupt.
i wish more people thought in terms of incentives like you do.
damn, her driver's license must've been huge.
... it wasn't the sms that killed her.
the sms set off a signal in a rewired phone attached to an explosive that was attached to her car.
she was killed by a car bomb.
the sms was just an elaborate trigger for the bomb.
stupid headline.
i thought they hacked her phone i thought she was using a note 7. edit: 7 ... 7 seriously thought it was that law abiding citizen judge death kind of bomb... that could have been gruesome.
those are real.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yahya_ayyash#assassination similar, triggered by a landline telephone.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_wrath_of_god#1972–1988 did anyone read the headline and actually think the text literally killed them?
further legitimizing the papers... are people.claiming they are not legitimate?
not really.
they're laughing at us and saying "what can you do about it?"
not necessarily.
but for those unfamiliar/not concerned... lookie lookie.
how are journalists all over the world going at this?
this sets a massive precedent on people who report on news against basically anyone.
people like her do it, knowing of the danger, because it’s the right thing to do.
that’s why people like her will keep fighting the good fight.
[removed] [removed] mojave?
mo' problems, am i right?
and now, i would like to play one of my very favourite songs to you.
*please be big iron please be big iron please be big iron please be big iron* nope.
johnny guitar.
she is our country’s hero.
she spoke the truth thats why she was killed.
without her we would never have found out what a corrupt government we have.
journalists have been attacked/assassinated for uncovering the truth for years, this is nothing new.
hell, putin has been *allegedly* knocking off journalists left and right for years who report against his shit.
same as ever.
tell the truth of corruption and run the risk of the selfish bastards getting vengeful.
"to learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize".
it would appear our hidden rulers are in the panama papers, and are not happy about it.
is there some website which blows the contents of the panama papers wide open?
like, make it easy for the average joe/jane to understand?
also make it into a torrent so it can be distributed widely?
i think theyre supposed to be multiple terabytes so probably not it would be great if somebody setting up a cellphone-triggered bomb would get a random spam call.
i think it actually happened once.
terrorist was making a bomb and when he turned his phone on, he got a "thank you for activating" message from his carrier and it blew the bomb up and him with it you are correct.
oddly enough it was a [woman not a man](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1351673/spam-text-message-saying-happy-new-year-triggered-black-widow-suicide-bombers-explosive-belt-early.html).
[removed] this is literally a way for the extremely rich to tell the lower classes to shut up and not dig.
class warfare at its finest, and yet the middle class in the us are busy arguing about football players and tweets.
just like the top percenters want.
this so very true.
don't look at our huge pile of ill-gotten wealth that we siphoned off from the working class.
ignore how our pile grows ever year and yours shrinks.
look!
some immigrants on welfare!
that's costing you a couple bucks in taxes a year!
get 'em!
i find it kind of sad that the only time i've ever seen something maltese related on the front page of reddit is the murder of our most popular journalist.
&gt;prosecutors have not released a motive for the killing.
*raises hand* ooh, ooh, pick me!!
pick me!!
i know!!
i guarantee you that the people arrested are fall guys who had nothing to with killing her.
you don't just casually expose fraudulent actions that implicate the richest leaders of the known world.
the fact that she wasn't offered protection and that global media coverage will bury this under the rug goes to show how deep this exposure goes.
"we did a thorough investigation, and the motive for the killing was a robbery gone wrong."
"our investigation has led us to believe this was a suicide.
case closed."
i can't imagine being a journalist right now.
the potential threats on your life are very real.
to be a mexican journalist must be a freaking nightmare, there has been hundreds of them killed in the last decade, either by drug cartels or by government.
*"galizia's family has repeatedly questioned the independence of the investigation by authorities, who were often the target of her blog"* you don't fucking say.
how many others involved in these types of paper leaks have gone missing or died?
maybe i watch too many movies/tv shows but if government was responsible, which imo they were, for that reason alone i kind of doubt the people that were caught and charged were actually the ones who did it.
i feel like the rich and the powerful who were exposed in the panama papers will never have any repercussions.
&gt; fatal text message wat the text message activates the bomb so the bomb killed her, not the text yeah, but that wouldn't get as much attention.
clickbait works, that's why it is done.
the text set us up the bomb?
killer queen has already touched the text [removed] the title wording is shite.
unless text messages can kill then this isn't misleading at all.
during ww1, britain developed a joke that was so funny anyone who heard it would die laughing.
they translated it to german, deployed it on the western front (where the uk troops were immune to the joke because they did not understand german) and it helped win the war.
i saw this in some british documentary from the 1970s?
or monty python.
if you send a text to a samsung note 7 possibly.
is this class terrorism?
so uhh, i guess, /r/murderedbywords
it's a bit fucking late for that someone tell trudeau.
i can't believe people are sympathetic towards people who left their country to join a major terrorist organization that has killed hundreds of their own citizens.
it's mind-boggling.
what, its not like said organizations burn people in cages or anything... or throw hundreds of kids into industrial dough mixers.... please tell me this didnt happen... sorry... https://www.google.com/amp/s/nypost.com/2016/10/26/isis-kills-250-kids-in-dough-kneader-burns-adults-alive/amp/ is this really a reliable source?
i hate isis but i love the truth, and this just seems too crazy.
isis is a lot like north korea, in that they both get up to some insane stuff, but a lot of it is unsubstantiated rumors or even deliberate lies to get clicks.
case in point, there was a story circulating last year about isis killing teenagers by cutting them in half with chainsaws.
the source for this claim?
a single anonymous blog post without any direct proof, just a claim from a anonymous blogger that they had witnessed it.
maybe, but at the same time there are hundreds of full hd videos on r/watchpeopledie with isis executions.
well, there is a video floating around that shows someone getting decapitated with a chainsaw.
no clue if it was isis or not though the burning in cages is true, can't speak to the kids thing though and i really don't want to confirm it time for some r/wholesomememes if we ever start to doubt the extreme and maniacal danger these organisations bring to this world we need only take a quick scroll through r/watchpeopledie.
&gt; take a quick scroll through r/watchpeopledie.
but how do we stop chinese people from driving in china?
or russians in russia?
if there’s one thing that sub has taught me, it’s that no one should ever go to brazil.
brasil is not for amateurs it's basically playing diablo2 on hardcore.
grind your life away to get safe and secure.
then some random asshole decides to turn on pvp and kill you for no reason.
and then you get breath of the dying ayyyyy unless you are into murdering people, then it seems like a paradise.
in brazil you have something like a 50/50 chance of being saved by the correct actions of, or being a victim of an off-duty police officer in action.
yup.
2 days ago i saw an 8 year old isis jihadi shoot a prisoner in the head and scream allah akbar.
terrible stuff... plus they basically aligned themselves with a foreign power with the stated goal of annihilating the uk (among others) which should be tantamount to treason.
its not tantamount it is treason of the highest degree against both the crown and country cool, so charge them with that.
but they are still subjects of the very crown with the accompanying rights... exactly, which is a point that a lot of people are missing.
if they're citizens and you want to throw them into jail, they get the same fair trial as anyone else.
the problem is it's extremely difficult to prove they've done anything wrong and the government can't just arbitrarily start denying people rights because they went on a holiday to syria.

magna carta / rule of law : "no free man is to be arrested, or imprisoned &lt;edit&gt; or outlawed, or exiled, or in any other way ruined, nor will we go against him or send against him, except by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land."
so is he arguing that, if they come back they don't get a fair trial?
or just that we should kill them before they are able to enter?
and do we really not think the rule of law should apply overseas?
i don’t have sympathy for them.
i just like my section 6 charter rights and i don’t want them weakened to solve a problem the justice system can be equiped to deal with.
i don’t want former isis fighters to be denied entry, i want them welcomed by a pair of handcuffs.
oh no, don't forget, terrorists are bad and therefore the charter doesn't apply to them.
fuck that noise.
everyone is protected.
if people have committed terrorism offences then they should be tried fairly.
if they can be rehabilitated then they should be.
i'm exceedingly annoyed with the people who will happily toss everything out the window for the point of making a "trudumb" or "lieberals" -esque point.
we have a constitution and its guarantees apply to everyone, no matter the heinousness of any alleged crimes.
on that note, none of our rights should be weakened.
section 1 is a joke.
also if they want to stop fighting i'd much rather see them brought back and interrogated for anything useful they might know.
making it impossible for your enemy to surrender is never a good strategy its not sympathy to say that they deserve a trial.
they're accused of horrific criminal acts and should feel the full force of law if convicted.
but justice doesn't operate without a trial and evidence.
there may be ways around the security issues that might present, but the good news is that technology does exist that allows people to stand trial without being physically present in the courtroom.
but not providing a trial and moving straight to conviction and punishment, that just devalues rights.
because what use is a right that evaporates when you need it most.
your criticism is just about as flawed as those who say extremist speech should be grounds for arrest.
its horrible, sure, but if free speech is going to mean anything at all, it has to be stronger than that.
we cant go removing rights just because of a particularly heinous accusation.
we need far, far better reasons than anger to do that.
reasons which still come with checks, like fraud or perjury.
we cant claim a high ground by undermining our own institutions.
the problem most people don't realise is you have to be able to prove these people left the country to fight for terrorists.
everyone deserves a fair trial, no matter the circumstance.
it's a slippery slope when we start punishing people based on suspicion alone.
they should face military trials instead of civilian ones as they engaged in warfare.
we don’t recognize them as legal combatants.
so they don’t get a military trial.
yeah that's not how military trials work.
they don't have legal grounds and have poor standards of justice; it wouldn't matter if isis signed the geneva convictions because you can put anyone you want on a military trial.
civilians have been put on military trials numerous times throughout history (usually when they are caught in the crossfires of a war).
they shouldn't be dignified in that way.
they are common criminals.
it is not that people are sympathetic towards them, but there is still a belief in the rule of law, evidence and a fair trial.
just rounding up everyone who had traveled to syria or iraq in the last four years and locking them away indefinitely with no regard to their rights as citizens is a recipe for a $10 million payout.
this exactly.
it's not sympathy, it's just the fact that the canadian constitution applies equally to all canadians.
to suggest that a canadian who joins isis forgoes their right to a fair trial and their right not to be tortured would be to say that some canadians are more equal than others, a dangerous precedent.
if citizenship is revocable it means absolutely nothing.
i don't have a good idea of what to do with citizens who join isis, but lifetime imprisonment is preferable to writing them off.
if rights can be removed they will be removed unjustly at some point; not that this hasn't happened in the past, but expressly doing this would make it easier in the future.
its not sympathy, its belief that the secular rule of law is what makes us better than these people.
bring them home, put them on trial.
leaving them stranded and stateless is only shirking our responsibility to deal with our own citizens.
simply pretending they have nothing to do with us is irresponsible and shirks away from addressing that such people have come from our own societies.
no one is sympathetic to people who joined terrorists.
no one.
the idea that liberals are for "sympathy" is just conservative rhetoric to rile up the base.
it's called rule of law and it needs to be applied to everyone equally.
just because someone travelled to the middle east does not mean they engaged in terrorism, and there are thorough psychiatric evaluations done to anyone suspected of partaking in terrorist plots.
people who **might** have joined a major terrorist organisation.
because that's the thing.
the people the government has on kill lists (they've explicitly said that's their solution to the problem) haven't undergone any form of due process, or had their day in court, so it appears the standard of evidence needed for the government to summarily execute one of its own citizens is a pretty please from mi6.
we have already seen (white) britons being arrested on trumped up charges for going to fight against isis in syria (inspired by george orwell's actions in spain in the '30s).
the judiciary has been one of the pillars of democracy for hundreds of years, and the extent to which power has been concentrated in the executive (not even parliament) and protections removed over the last 20 years is disgraceful and sets a very dangerous precedent.
it's not about whether you trust this government, or the next government, not to become tyrannical, but what happens in the next few decades, and let's face it it's not looking good.
classic false dichotomy of "either you agree with everything we say or you're a terrorist sympathiser" and it's unpatriotic nonsense.
terrorists can burn in hell.
just don't let them ruin centuries of democratic precedent.
as boris johnson said, they are not an existential threat - they're weak, viscous cowards, and they should be locked up for life (or killed in actual combat), and it's sickening that we're allowing terrorist tactics to be so effective.
please elaborate.
what did justin do?
the government is proposing to "re-integrate" former isis fighters.
i have a funny feeling this will not go well.
https://globalnews.ca/video/3868046/canada-offers-reintegration-support-for-isis-fighters that's a bit of an over-simplification.
no one is proposing that re-integrating isis fighters should be a priority.
the reality is, under the our laws these people are free to return to the country and it's going to be extremely hard to convict many of them of anything illegal.
given that we're stuck between a rock and a hard place, re-integration programs are one tool being used in conjunction with surveillance, travel restrictions, investigations, and if possible criminal prosecution.
http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/ they do good work rehabilitating neo-nazis, and i would think similar tactics will work for other extremists.
although, i doubt effective rehabilitation would seem to be punitive enough for the public's liking, with it inevitably being portrayed as 'letting them off easy.'
there are muslim ex-extremists who have been freed from their hate, i encourage you find out what they say helped them to see sense.
i think the argument is that punitive justice doesnt actually help anyone.
all it does is exact some form of revenge on the criminal, which is obviously not helpful.
it doesnt prevent crime rate, even with stiff penalties.
so with rehabilitation, at least some portion of the criminals are reformed.
there is a story that the liberal government has brought back 60 isis fighters without the publics knowledge, and plan to process another 160 that they are watching overseas.
the word rehabilitation is being used a lot and when asked about it during question time, trudeau simply started talking about islamophobia.
did not touch the question at all.
also of note is that these people had been in canada since 2015, of which trudeau was prime minister for only 2 months.
&gt; rehabilitation with a 9mm i hope.
&gt;the uk will "bring destruction" to those who fight for so-called islamic state, the defence secretary has said.
sounds like they're not coming home.. they're already home.
they fled like bitches as soon as their great islamic state started getting pounded in the ass from all sides.
they're sitting in front of their 50" tv right now in a warm apartment paid for by our social welfare.
are they though?
i mean an estimated 800 left, many are already dead.. and they’ll know who went and who tries to come back edit: official figures are 800-850 http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-32026985 many already dead and the rest hunted by sas so will be dead soon if not already.
unless you're talking about america's jihadis as you said "social welfare" in which case that looks a little more bleak for the yanks.. https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/isis-jihadis-have-returned-home-by-the-thousands &gt;isis jihadis have returned home by the thousands exactly.
the bigger concern should be ensuring more people do not become radicalized in the first place.
make an example of these people through official, legal channels to show why our system is superior.
i don’t think the people who join isis care too much about your logic.
[khalid mahmood](http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/khalid-mahmood-2000-british-fighters-7312675) believes up to 2000 british fighters have travelled to warzone.
and [sadiq khan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcqo8c8bwkw) has said there is at least 200 jihadists in london.
&gt; they're sitting in front of their 50" tv right now in a warm apartment paid for by our social welfare.
please point me in the direction of social welfare that pays for big tvs, flats, and heating thanks.
to be fair, a 50in flat screen tv isn't exactly something that costs a fortune anymore.
maybe not for you, but everything costs a fortune when you're struggling just to eat &amp; keep a roof over your head.
-someone who's lived on minimum wage before.
that's where predatory lenders like brighthouse come in, dangling shiny tvs in front of people psychologically worn down by poverty.
hahahahahahahahaa.
funny.
since the car destroyed ours over a year ago we have been saving so hard for a new one.
unfortunately british minimum wage doesn't allow much in the way of disposable income after rent / food / family to look after.
edit: cat destroyed, not car, that would have been even worse!
just got mine for $330 that’s more than i make in a month the same one used by the mythical welfare queen driving a cadillac.
you...don't seem to know how much you can actually get from welfare... the issue is, in my opinion, not that they are allowed back, as i'm not one who wants to start making people stateless because of their ideology.
we have a justice system for a reason, we should prosecute these people for actively joining a terrorist organisation under the full extent of the law.
and so i ask, please do not make this about immigration/border control, or welfare.
i don’t know, people who believe in an ideology that glorifies *fucking beheading people in slow motion and then posting it online* may deserve to be stateless, but what do i know.
and you believe that if you gave such power to your government, or any other government for that matter, that they would only *ever* use it in cases such as this?
don't be so quick to dismiss the decades of progress of international human rights treaties just because you find them inconvenient.
let's not, in the name of righteousness, lower ourselves to their level.
extreme cases make bad law.
don't imagine an isis fighter, imagine the law being misapplied; because all laws are misapplied at some point.
better to let a hundred guilty men go free then punish one innocent.
if they come back, let them in and arrest them.
put them on trial and demonstrate in a court of law how wrong they were , put their crimes on record so no one can deny what they did.
then jail them for life.
will have to be a separate jail.
there's currently an outbreak of radicalisation in prisons, if he has social access to people who are going to be released in 2 years for example, it's going to cause a bigger problem.
practical problems can be solved.
the issue is sticking up for our own principles which are - we don't kill criminals , we jail them after a fair trial.
it's the anthesis of what the takfiri scum believe and it demonstrates they can't win.
if want to see how powerful justice delivered in this way in - look at the trcs in south africa.
killing them absolves gives them what they want without doing anything to demonstrate how wrong they are.
if you commit crimes in another country, you should be prepared to accept the punishment from that country.
also, you seem a bit optimistic about the extremism problems in prisons, they are not as easy to solve as you make out.
also western governments have so far completely ignored the problem (e.g.
most terrorist in france became radicalised in prison for petty crimes, and still have not done a thing to address it).
engaging in war crimes and fighting for a foriegn force are crimes in the uk.
at the very least they are offences worthy of extradition.
you need to separate two issues.
issue one is the moral argument argument for delivering justice.
issue two is the process of punishment.
issue one is asks wether we should jail them for a crime that was comitted -and that would be a yes.
issue two is how you deliver the punishment without increasing their ability to recruit and ensuring you meet the wider moral precepts of your society.
issue two is a process question , in effect, and you can solve these problems with the political will to do so.
your comment highlights a lack of politcal will not a failure of issue one.
if you were a briton that joined the nazi armed forces during ww2, you could expect to be treated like an enemy soldier and killed.
it's not reasonable to get evidence beyond reasonable guilt from a foreign warzone.
in combat, you would, but once you came back and you were capture you faced a trail for treason.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_joyce#capture_and_trial where does the treason trail lead?
back then it'd have lead to the death sentence, however, it no longer would, as the death sentence has been completely abolished in the uk.
it scares me how many people don't understand the different between justice and revenge.
thank you for standing up for justice.
the uk's prison radicalization remedy seems to be to keep potential radicals out of prison by not investigating them for crimes.
;) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2tkhn2uv6i i disagree with your first point on the basis that certain countries have absolutely barbaric laws (imprisonment for getting raped for instance) and nobody should be subjected to that.
though i'd argue that nobody should go to those countries in the first place you sure as hell shouldn't be subjected to their barbarism if at all possible.
i agree our jails are a problem but leaving them out there just makes them someone else's problem.
imo we should help clean up this mess.
solitary confinement or specialist prisons for those with no hope of release.
the united states has some great space in cuba we'd be happy to lease you.
we already have australia.
currently?
this is the story of prisons since their inception &gt; then jail them for life you can't *technically* do that, as it's against the european convention on human rights.
https://www.theguardian.com/law/2013/jul/09/whole-life-jail-sentences-without-review-breach-human-rights you can give them a life sentence, but you have to allow for reviews and opportunities for parole (even if the outcome of those reviews is continued detention,) so you can't just metaphorically 'throw away the key'.
although i agree that the due process of law is a cornerstone of our legal system and society.
a british citizen who is no directly longer engaging us as an enemy combatant should be treated according to law.
only problem with jailing them for life is that they then become a leech on tax paying citizens.
if they are known to join terrorist or extremist groups, revoke their visa and status as a uk citizen and put them on the next plane back.
edit: back with details it costs £65000 to put someone in prison and a further £40000 to keep the in each year.
(citing fpe.org.uk) edit2: i'm not alt-right.
i do, in hindsight see that my logic is flawed.
no need for more pm's so do criminals.
if you're going to apply this apply it to all criminals.
because that's what they are criminals.
by making them a special category of criminal you're arguing that you accept their definition of the themselves as martyrs.
which is what they are not.
also, if this is the case with these men or women, what about thomas mair, are we going to do the same to him?
revoking citizenship, what could possibly go wrong!
&gt; revoke their visa and status as a uk citizen and put them on the next plane back the problem is that that violates human rights.
you can't just leave someone stateless.
they have a state, the islamic state.
they made that choice.
well you can, other countries are doing it after all.
but you're right, leaving people stateless would be breaking un conventions and is as well a dick move that will really show the people that the u.k isn't the oppressive imperialistic government that terrorists claim it to be... it costs over £30k a year to keep a prisoner in the uk.
why on earth would you invite someone back who wants to kill your citizens and despises your culture to then pay for his food and rent.
while at the same time radicalising more people in the prison.
is it not the right thing to do?
rather than have some politicians decide (or just make up) that someone has joined isis, and ban them from returning home?
i guess maybe a better question is, would you be ok if you're living in the uk, and the government tells you "your aunt/father/grandfather/son won't be allowed back into the uk because we have determined they were a terrorist"?
or would you rather they have to meet some sort of burden of proof and then punish them?
as someone in the u.s., the idea that someone in the government can say "that american is a terrorist, we can strip him of all his rights, kill him, remove his citizenship, etc."
is absolutely terrifying.
why?
makes more sense not to put the extra cost on society imo there's more to running a civilization than balance sheets.
"what if we kill all the poor people?
have you run that through the computer?"
its not a cost when you're proving your system works because fuck the people of wherever the terrorists get to stay, right?
the problem here is that it's very difficult to sentence them for any crime, as it's very hard to prove that they did anything wrong there.
it's basically 100% certain they did, but impossible to prove.
and due to "innocent until proven guilty" it would be very difficult to sentence them for anything at all.
do you really not see a problem with the government having a way to punish its citizens without trial?
do you really think something like that would be used for good?
what about 10, 20, 50, 100 years down the line?
do you trust those people in the future to only use this policy for good?
i definitely don't trust theresa "snooper's charter" may with that kind of power today.
joining a terrorist organization is a crime.
they don't have to do anything, just prove that they joined you left to join an organization that wants to destroy our country, and when they failed, you want to come back to said country?
nah.
i'm usually pretty liberal but come on.
seriously.
fuck these people.
ban them, jail them, execute them.
don't care.
don't want them anywhere near me.
[removed] maajid nawaz the radio presenter was an islamist who only returned to the uk because he happened to be in an isis jail at the time.
he is also now an ardent secularist, something of an exception and basically the lone voice criticising islam from the inside in the uk.
i also believe in the universality of human rights, even for people you hate, even if you are right to hate them.
this is naive to think that even 1% of these men coming back are going to be anything like maajid.
in my opinion, if you leave your nation to fight its aggressor then you are no longer a citizen and an enemy to the state.
they are enemies of the state.
they do however deserve a trial.
i personally think this is the perfect answer here.
let them back into the country, but then absolutely charge them for their crimes immediately.
if it is illegal for me to go fuck children in another country, then it sure as hell should be illegal to go play pretend righteous asshole in another on too.
&gt; i also believe in the universality of human rights living in the uk is not a human right.
but it is a british citizen right yes?
though i think it should lead to jail in the uk if you are uk citizen, it kinda is.
&gt;something of an exception an extraordinary exception yes, and the hebdo attacker brothers were also released back into society from jail after a sentence for terrorism, getting out 18 months early, and they were allowed back into the country after training in yemen, and they were allowed to roam free when u.s. intelligence warned france.
what's a few french lives when you can respect the universality of human rights by giving terrorists chances to assimilate?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charlie_hebdo_shooting#chérif_and_saïd_kouachi don't even bother trying to figure out how the bastion of liberalism, europe, was able to find a way to get an rpg and ak's into the hands of these guys.
i don't know much about him but hear about him through sam harris who i admire.
imo he should have been banned from returning to the uk and live somewhere else, then make a case to the uk to be let back in, quoting his activism.
they joined a group who hand out female sex slaves as rewards.
they pitch gays off of tall buildings.
they destroy priceless cultural relics.
they murder civilians in the hundreds and thousands.
this has been known for years.
if anyone joins this group of their own will, with these facts known, they should be cast out of the human race.
they don’t like the west let them stay out of the west.
governments seem to be very slow in passing laws aimed to foreigners fighters.
they should be considered all terrorists and shipped to specific jail far away from other inmates at risk of radicalisation.
yea and 100 years later they start surfing and saying 'gday mate'.
sounds like a win for everybody.
bring back the penal colony.
but where's the penal colony going to be now?
antarctica?
or just the unused part of the outback?
i would rather these people were in uk jails than still in the me enabling terrorism e: you people sure are thirsty for blood 2e: i am aware of people being radicalised in jail, you don't need to tell me over and over or best of both worlds, in a middle eastern jail cell.
or, you know.
dead.
edit: people seem to think i want them to get the death penalty or killed without a trial.
i just want them dead by their own stupidity.
accidental premature detonation or whatever.
yeah i prefer my terrorists dead too.
did you watch the attack: terror in the uk?
its premise was people converting and being radicalised in uk prisons before going on to commit acts of terror.
you'd rather they were in uk jails, radicalising the inmates who are in for non-terrorism related crimes?
that's what led to this situation in the first place.
they are and they're radicalizing the prison population.
didn’t they also say they would hunt them all down and just kill them instead?
people seem to think this is just another type of crime to be dealt with in the courts.
it's not a criminal matter.
these people have declared their intent and desire to overthrow western governments and implement stonings, amputations and beheadings like we have seen in syria.
they have declared war against us and have picked up weapons and fired at us.
these aren't moped thieves, they are a fifth column of soldiers.
so.. like treason?
it's treason then.
the senate will decide that.
i am the senate as much as the emotional part of me wants to say to just not let these people in and get them executed for basically declaring war on the western world, rationally i know that yes, we should let them back in and then charge them for treason.
we should try to be civilized and rational about this, the world could use some more of both.
yep.
my view is - define terrorism - many people went out to fight for the kurds who are now losing moral high ground, and jabat al nusra were originally an al qaeda cell who changed name fighting against assad and is.
we need courts to make these decisions not politicians.
it seems like most people are arguing about feelings when the real issue is whether to put them on trial as an enemy combatant, or an unlawful combatant.
yes, it's important we recognize the radicalized forces at home that want to do away with rule of law, and want to empower the state to murder just about anyone if it can find the right justification.
says who?
i don't mean 'who says that should be the result?
', i mean 'who says they did that?'
shouldn't there be a legal proceeding to prove they actually did go off and become a terrorist before they're punished?
or is merely being accused sufficient?
seems like the courts have to be involved in some way to establish guilt before doing something like stripping them of citizenship.
&gt; it's not a criminal matter.
yes, it is.
their delusions of grandeur don't mean you or the government gets to pretend human rights don't apply.
everyone has human rights.
if you can suspend human rights for certain people then you set a dangerous precedent prone to abuse.
seems like a common sense solution to me, i agree it's shitty passing the buck and extralegal punishment.
britain should dealt with british citizens rather than revoking their citizenship and leaving them someone else's problem.
if they can prove that they have committed crimes try them in the uk or extradite them to a country who can give them a fair trial.
if they cannot prove they committed crimes then the government should not be taking significant punitive action against them, though keeping a close eye on them is probably warranted.
basically, it takes away their only bridge back.
if you don't have anywhere else to go to, you basically have to stay with the terrorists even if you have a change of heart.
then they can die in a coalition airstrike.
win win don't move to canada then.
don't worry, we know there are at least 49 of them and they are, i assure you, under careful watch!
what could go wrong?
/s we should send them to a gulag in the arctic.
there is nothing common sense about going down a road that leads to governments being able to choose to revoke your citizenship.
i know it gets overused these days, but there is definitely a risk of this leading to a slippery slope.
today it's terrorists that get their citizenship revoked, tomorrow maybe they stretch the definition of terrorist a bit further and now political agitators can have their citizenship revoked.
no reasonable person should ever celebrate the idea of countries revoking citizenship.
i dont disagree, but is it legal?
if they are british and you don't let them in, is that rendering them stateless?
[deleted] well i thought that rendering someone stateless is illegal under at least one of the many international treaties we are signed up to.
give them a trial “laws and principles are not for the times when there is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul rise in mutiny against their rigour ... if at my convenience i might break them, what would be their worth?” ― charlotte brontë if you have moral qualms about killing them in syria without a trial (i don't - they joined isis after watching the beheadings and burning people alive and mass executions, and being aware about the sexual slaves and rapes and murders), give them a trial in absentia and at least revoke their citizenship.
that should be the first step - not allowing them back.
if they come back, there's a high risk of them radicalising others.
&gt;if you have moral qualms about killing them in syria without a trial they are enemy combatants.
i am honestly curious how anyone could object at them being treated as such.
one thing is someone dieing in a combat zone in an active engagement.
no one wants police and co to go into unnecessary danger to capture them.
however if we capture them they have a right to a fair trial.
not because we owe it to them but we owe it to ourselves.
what’s the point in pointing at the enemy and saying they’re trying to destroy our values and then going on to ignore one of the core western values that is a fair and just legal system for all people.
well just be doing their job for them.
you can't revoke the uk citizenship of someone with a single passport... should be the same for all other nations.
let them be brought to justice as terrorists by the locals.
sadly for canada it is not.
our mighty leader trudeau is letting them back in hoping they can be re-integrated into society...he has nice hair though.
i like how the conservative leader questioned him on the issue, and trudeau promptly called him an islamophobe.
why not?
that word is a wonderful cudgel used to beat nuance and reason into the dirt.
you'd be pretty silly to hold back such a powerful weapon if it's at your disposal.
the right answer would have been: "shame on you for equaying my fear of terrorism with fear of islam".
this is the answer.
it's a shame the most vocal conservatives never say this.
the justice minister said that they would prosecute those where enough evidence was available.
where we don’t, suvaillance will be used, but re-integration is the next option if we can’t jail them.
nice fud though.
delving into some really interesting grey territories these days.
many nations are saying they will flat out kill any of their citizens they find working with terrorists, which technically violates a lot of rights those citizens have, though they do waive many rights when they flaunt their own laws.
i suspect, though, that a grieving family of a wayward kid who ran off and was then killed by their own government will sue the government anyway.
win or lose, it will be expensive.
then there's the issue of many nations refusing to do their part with regards to deportation.
right now canada has over 1500 people that are set to be deported, but their home countries are refusing to take them back, so we are holding on to someone else's problem at our expense.
in this case, britons are going to other countries to fight, and those countries may very well not want foreigners taking up their prison spaces when they have enough domestic terrorists to deal with.
let's say the iraq government captures and deports these guys, is the uk going to say "no, he's your problem now"?
that's not fair to iraq, why should they pay to deal with a brit who shouldn't be there in the first place?
it's all well and good to make some big statements, but when it comes down to legal rights people have regardless of what idiotic adventures they've gone it, regardless of how misguided by indoctrination they might be, countries can't just kill their problem, or just force some other country to deal with it.
at least by capturing and returning them, you can give them a quick military tribunal show trial and toss them in a hole to be forgotten, and no one can tie you up in court suing you for violated rights.
or, the framework of the law can be re-written to protect governments from their actions against these people... which takes a long time, and often comes with a great many other little details that affect the rights and freedoms of everyone, not just the intended targets.
i guess, ultimately, it's a very complex problem, there's no simple solution, no grand statement that can be made in parliament that will solve our woes, and how we deal with our own home grown terrorists does not really solve the underlying social problems that led to these people being radicalized.
don't make the mistake of martyring them (in the eyes of any sympathetics still at home) &gt;in october, the terror laws watchdog said authorities should look to "reintegrate" the "young" and "naive" jihadis who travel to warzones, rather than prosecute them, on their return to the country.
&gt;max hill qc, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, spoke of "losing a generation" of men and women by automatically using the courts to punish them.
how does someone actually believe it's a good idea to let jihadis back into the country?
“losing a generation” eh, not really.
i’d hardly call low-thousands “an entire generation “ 100% agree.
the tens millions of young men who left for ww1 and never came back?
that's a lost generation (literally called this by the french).
the couple thousand idiots who see what isis does online and thinks they want to be a part of this so they leave their western world to fight in syria?
no, that is not a 'lost generation'... if anything, losing them is a net positive to the country.
net positive to the world my thoughts reading the headline "wait, they are allowed back in the uk?"
please inform the prime minister of canada, justin trudeau about this article.
"islamaphobes!"
at one point people here (uk) wanted to "rehabilitate" them and give them new identities.
fuck off, i don't want these fucks being relocated near me or my family (it's actually happened with other criminals including paedophiles, as i live in a low populated area although they were housed in council houses away from me, my point stands).
it's fucking disgusting if they let any of them in, keep the bastards out and let them sit in the sand filled dust-bowl they dug themselves.
i'm as liberal as he next man, and more than most, but honestly i kind of think he's got a point.
it's never been a secret what isis is.
it's not a secret what they do or how they do it - whatever else you might want to say about them, they've made a point about being completely open about their methods of murder, torture, rape, genocide and terrorism.
anyone who sees that and thinks "awesome, *that's* what i want to be a part of", well yeah fucking right i don't want them to come back here.
as far as i'm concerned, when they chose to become subjects of the caliphate, they chose to no longer be citizens of the united kingdom - and who doubts that they would have wholehearted agreed at the time they made that choice?
you don't get to declare war on britain, actively support and engage in atrocities that are diametrically counter to every principle this country is supposed to be for, and then ask for taksie-backsies when things get tough and it loks like you're going to lose.
[removed] unlike canada you mean?
he's just virtue signalling to his conservative base.
even his own party have criticised him and made it clear what he is suggesting is against the law.
virtue signaling to his conservative base?
trudeau has talked about not jailing returning terrorists, but trying to integrate them.
also, what conservative base?
trudeau is a left leaning liberal, and no conservatives like him.
not his base.
that's the polar opposite of pandering to conservatives.
the conservatives want these people either out of the country or in prison.
any person who is against war crimes, and their countrymen taking up arms against western democracy should want the same.
i'm talking about the uk defence secretary.
they should be executed for high treason.
but hey, that's just my opinion.
my only concern with this is that if the west ever turns their backs on the kurds to appease turkey then alot of the british leftists who volunteered to fight with the ypg aligned international freedom brigades against isis are fucked.
i mean, let back into the country to be executed or inprisoned is fine.
i wish we would do that in canada, instead of our idiot defence minister saying we'll bring them back to rehabilitate them.
then he added that they dont generally rehabilitate.
no kidding.
iraq and syria would trial them and execute them for war crimes, in fact the uk sectary should be helping them to bring war criminals to justice.
someone needs to talk with our prime minister justin trudeau.
nah, anyone who disagrees is obviously an islamophobic kill them before they return.
problem solved on several fronts.
i have to say i agree.
people so easily convinced to do something so immoral have no sanctuary inside our borders.
it's treason then they should create a show.
to catch a terrorist.
call up chris hanson.
where the fucks chris hanson been?
how is this even a question?
what is wrong with europeans in respect to letting terrorists go and not putting them in jail so they can commit terror?
i know in the states we put people in jail way too much but damn almost all the terror attacks in the last couple years were done by people on lists of some kind or people they already had in custody.
nobody feels sorry for benedict arnold.
treason of this sort needs to be a capital offense.
execution by firing squad if the outcome they deserve.
umm yes... i get people make mistakes sometime but joining a terrorist group willingly is unforgivable.
i have a couple genuine questions.
i am an ignorant american not familiar with british law or international agreements.
if the british terrorists fly back to the uk, does that mean uk customs just puts them on a flight to another nation?
would they be arrested for trying to reenter?
will it be like that tom hanks movie, [the terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_terminal) and terrorists are forced to live in the secure boarding zone of the airports across the uk?
if a terrorist only holds uk citizenship and is not eligible for other citizenship, why wouldn't the uk want to prosecute them for being a terrorists?
how is it not the responsibility of the uk to prosecute them?
i've read the arguments in this thread about uk prisons having problems with radicalization occurring within the prisons, but how is this not the uks responsibility?
it sounds like changes should be made to the prison system, instead of burdening other countries with the worst citizens of the uk?
these terrorist still may commit horrible acts and they will still be british.
it kind of sounds like the uk doesn't want to take responsibility for it's citizens, nor address the root of the problem when these young men are initially becoming enchanted with isis.
i am not implying that this idea is good or bad, i am merely trying to understand the proposal.
thank you for any insight you may have, whether you are british or not.
the fact this is even controversial is depressing... any member of isis should be barred from the uk/free world in general for life without exception.
good grief.
just assert the protections of the 5th amendment like a big boy, jr. ““the mob takes the fifth,” he said at an iowa campaign rally in september (2016).
“if you're innocent, why are you taking the fifth amendment?” from this washington post article: [if you’re innocent, why are you taking the fifth?’ trump said — years after invoking it himself](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/05/23/if-youre-innocent-why-are-you-taking-the-fifth-trump-said-years-after-invoking-it-himself/?utm_term=.a819426b2246) i know the fifth covers spouses, but does it cover children/parents, too?
you’re thinking of spousal privilege (also called marital privilege) no- it’s only between husband and wife and i am not a lawyer, so i could be totally wrong "because you can't charge a husband and wife for the same crime!"
"yes you can, dad."
"...i have the word fucking attorneys."
it's just a little, light treason.
first time offender?
right, that's what i was referring to, and i had never heard of "parental privilege" or "child privilege" in relation to family members being asked to testify against each other.
i thought spousal privilege was part of or an extension of the 5th, though.
there are several different kinds of privilege.
the 5th only applies to self incrimination.
other common kinds of privilege include spousal/marital privilege (which are actually two different things), attorney-client, priest-penitent (like church confession), and physician-patient.
priest-penitent privilege should be removed, they can ask god for forgiveness once they are have admitted guilty to to law officials first.. we would be in much better position when it comes to the ever increasing church scandals, mainly about pedophilia... i mean, can one really have absolvance in the face of god if both the law of the land and the doctrines of the religion are broken but only one is "fixed"?
i know, off topic but there are some privileges that just should not exist.. i don't see the harm.
i'd rather criminals tell a priest (who might try to persuade them to confess to authorities or make amends) than to tell nobody at all.
sure, if it happened that way but the more we hear what has happened in this confessionals, the more it is becoming clear that they rather protect them than try to persuade them to got to the police.
the worst cases involve witness intimidation and those are often kids.. the fifth enshrines the privilege against self incrimination.
other privileges are derived from tradition/common law and are preserved under the rules of evidence or procedure.
suh other privileges include the attorney-client, the doctor-patient, the spousal, the confessional, etc.
5th amendment - prevents self-incrimination.
generally cannot be used to avoid testifying against somebody else.
don’t know how it works outside of a court room though.
marital privilege - two parts (1) while married, spouse not on trial can refuse to testify against other spouse, only testifying spouse can claim this - lose this privilege upon divorce; (2) private communications made during marriage between spouses are privileged, do not lose this upon divorce.
atty-cl privilege pretty much covers communications between acl and lawyer in furtherance of the relationship (ie the reason for hiring the lawyer).
can lose this pretty easily (eg if there is a party present who is not necessary in furthering the purpose of the atty-cl relationship) &gt; 5th amendment - prevents self-incrimination.
generally cannot be used to avoid testifying against somebody else.
what if by testifying against someone else you know will implicate yourself, then can one take the 5th?
spousal privilege actually has nothing to do with the 5th, it's statutory.
congress passed it in the federal rules of evidence (and theoretically could decide to ditch it if they wanted to) thank you, that makes sense.
so in the case of this story, jr can only plead the 5th if he stands to incriminate himself, right?
that's correct.
practically though it'll be difficult to compel testimony.
even if he isn't the one being prosecuted, we don't know what his answers are and don't know that they won't be incriminating.
8 don't see him ever signing a plea or anything to protect himself from prosecution, so anything good will probably stay covered by the 5th/attorney privilege when actually applicable.
well the least they could do is charge him with contempt of congress the fifth only protects you from incriminating yourself, and a few other things, but doesn't apply to spousal privilege and, as of now, there are no privileges to cover parents/children...when you take the fifth, you cannot be compelled to testify against yourself, for example, if you take the fifth.
he would have to take the fifth, not invoke client/attorney privilege, which would not protect him in this case.
but as jack showed, daddy trump already said anyone who takes the fifth is guilty, so he's pretty well fucked right now.
while pissing on the first.
he stopped reading at the 2nd amendment.
the turd doesn't fall far from the asshole bono is no longer the world's biggest turd hate to be "that guy" but randy broke his record with a turd over 100 courics.
that being said, don jr. may be over 1000 over 9000!
is the reference you are looking for.
yes!!!!
i actually forgot about randy's 100 couric poop he'll have to fly 185 hats around the world in 185 private jets to regain his crown.
good 1 it's not how it's *supposed* to work, but it clearly worked exactly how he wanted it to work, with no consequences.
right up until the point where he's held in contempt of congress, i guess.
do we suppose that is going to happen?
i make no predictions, but that's what he's made himself vulnerable to.
whereas simply asserting the 5th amendment rights probably wouldn't have.
i'm not suggesting he's smart, i'm just saying, he can do pretty much whatever he wants with seemingly endless protection from a gop majority congress who isn't interested in getting answers to questions they don't like.
quite possibly, but relying on the good graces of the party in power is especially stupid when one doesn't need to.
&gt; but relying on the good graces of the party in power is especially stupid when one doesn't need to.
well sure, but again, it's only truly stupid if there are consequences, which there don't seem to be, here.
jr. is a moron, but consequences don't seem to exist, so in this instance, his bullshit bluff absolutely worked.
right up until the point where they do, as i said.
great.
when that happens, we can discuss it.
in the meantime, i'm just going to be mad and continue calling my reps who blow me off.
solid plan.
i'm in.
&gt;contempt of congress not this congress when was the last time that even happened?
i have been under a rock?
1935, i believe.
nowadays they just send things over to the justice department and indict, like with oliver north.
i'm pretty sure eric holder and lois lerner were both found in contempt of congress at separate points.
i can believe it.
and you think republicans would ever do that?
the correct response is "ah do not recall" "i would like to invoke my rich white guy privilege" this is what would happen if we elected george bluth except the bluths are far less malicious.
don jr: i'm claiming attorney-client privilege citizens for ethics and narrator in unison: that's not how it works.
don jr: Я сумасшедший о cornballer!
i declare attorney-client privilege!
you know you can't just say the words "attorney-client privilege" and expect anything to happen.
i didn't say it, i declared it.
damn, beat me to it i declare bankruptcy i declare shenanigans!
let me get my broom.
i *may* have engaged in some light treason.
i have the worst fucking attorneys and don jr is buster.
eric is clearly buster, don jr. is gob.
then who is this "hermano" everyone keeps talking about?
how's it going brothero?
me?
oh, good.
there's some bad hombres about, though.
and this "hermano" is about to get his ass kicked.
oh, mon frère.
that's french for brother.
i don't know why i know that, i took 6 years of spanish!
weird.
i thought *fratello* was french.
italian nah jr. is definitely gob.
he has the same dumb as shit unearned confidence.
and he's also a jr. "pshhhhhh!
like the guy in the $4000 suit is gonna go to jail for treason" "my twitter friend julian gives great advice" "dad, we have to get married.
a spouse can't be compelled to testify against their partner in court."
oh my god, it practically writes itself.
i guess ivanka is michael.
she’s obviously lindsey.
the family doesn’t have a michael maybe it's actually tiffany... lol..."the family doesn't have a michael" .
no, that's mike pence.
mike pence is obviously tobias i thought jared is tobias.
i’d argue jared is lucille.
pence is such a great fit for tobias just because they’re both in the closet maybe melania is lucille.
imagine her saying "it's a banana.
what could it cost, $10?"
and tell me melania isn't lucille.
the more i think about the 1:1 parallels the less funny it gets.
it’s still kind of unreal that anyone voted for basically the bluths to run the country eh, i'd say pence is 50/50 about being in the closet.
more than jared i hear he's an anal-rapist.
this would imply that there is one sane family member actually trying to do the right thing.
i could totally see an arrested development style show starring an exasperated general kelly, trying to keep sanity in an administration run amok by an add president and his 5 idiot children, all saying and doing stupid shit daily.
huckabee sanders crushes a chair, bannon caught eating from dumpster again, and then kellyanne walks in... i want author credits &gt; i want author credits that is not how it works.
at most you can get co-creator or "original idea".
most likely executive producer.
it exists to please people.
“my lawyer tells me that you can’t charge the father and the son with the same crime.” call him back and cite him for contempt if he repeats that bullshit excuse.
ah but that wouldn’t require a congress with a both a spine and the will to put their country before their party.
the gop has proven time and again that they’re simply unable.
it’s the perks of having an ignorant voting base.
you can do what you want and also bitch about abortion and immigrants.
i think we need to stop calling the gop "spineless".
they aren't afraid of trump.
they're complicit.
he has always offered them exactly what they want, just in an unappealingly douchey package.
dismantling the us government and selling the parts to koch affiliates has been the gop gameplan since reagan, or earlier.
this.
this is the best tl;dr i could make, [original](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2017/12/07/thats-not-how-it-works-experts-call-out-don-jrs-bogus-claim-attorney-client) reduced by 80%.
(i'm a bot) ***** &gt; donald trump jr. was interviewed by the members of the house intelligence commitee behind closed doors on wednesday as part of their russia probe, but they couldn&amp;#039;t get much out of him, due in part to what critics slammed as his &amp;quot;bogus&amp;quot; assertion of attorney-client privilege.
&gt; don jr. invoked attorney-client privilege to avoid disclosing conversations with his father, even though neither is a lawyer.
&gt; jr claims attorney client privilege lets him avoid answering because there were lawyers present when he talked with his dad.
but, if there&amp;#039;s anyone other than you &amp; your lawyer in the room, the privilege doesn&amp;#039;t apply.

they should really just stop expecting anyone in this administration to know anything about how the real world works it seems like they know how it works.
they do whatever stupid corrupt thing they want, and then everyone lets them get away with it.
that’s how it works.
has anyone in this family seen a lawyer?
does it even matter?
"if the president's son does it, that means it's not illegal" experts?
even first year law students know this is bs i think your average high school graduate knows this is bs.
you'd be surprised, because that's who elected trump in the first place... &gt;presence of third parties &gt;despite the general rule, there’s an exception in most states: in general, when a third person is present, the attorney-client privilege continues to apply if that third person is there in order to aid the cause.
put more specifically, the third person must be present while fulfilling a role that furthers the defendant’s legal representation.
the person might be part of the lawyer’s staff, an outside party with relevant expertise (for instance, an investigator), an interpreter, or even a relative who acts in an advisory role.
it's the headlines that are bs.
a decent lawyer would win this argument even if it weren't really true and by golly will the trump family have plenty of those on the payroll.
haha.
your lawyer would have to convince a judge that donald trump jr.’s presence was to aid the attorney and not his father.
i don't understand why he wasn't called out for this at the time.
because the ruling party is complicit.
$$$$ i wonder if that "trump pout" is hereditary.
he seems to have it down pat.
doesn't matter how anything works when the people who are supposed to hold others accountable for crap like this clearly have no interest in doing so.
usa is going down the toilet and the public thinks it's fucking great.
congress's investigation is a little sideshow, their findings/opinions don't matter anyway.
thats not how any of this works donald douche jr!!
so... what's the procedure if someone lies, or refuses to answer questions in a senate hearing?
isn't there a comptent of court charge?
perjury under oath?
you pump your fist in the air, yell out a rage and get back to work, citizen.
what do you want the economy to implode or something?!?
so he admits to paying a russian lawyer for help and advice?
like your childhood game of tag, he's the kid that always happens into a safe zone as he's about to be tagged.
fucking moron disallowed submissions us internal news/us politics &gt;a russian lawyer yeah okay not internal politics.
it's considered internal now.
then report it instead of whining like a little bitch.... to the moderator which job is to post anti trump stuff..... are you morons still on this *muh russia* fishing expedition?
y'all realize that the only thing that is going to come from it is the uncovering of dnc corruption.
do yourselves a favor and give it up already because the clapback on the democratic party is going to be more immense than you can calculate.
pretty sure hitlers lawer was in the room when he murdered millions of jews.
low quality where the fuck do you weirdos come up with these sources and how the hell are they qualifed as news?
commondreams.org?
give me a fucking break.
this news site according to mediabiasfactcheck.com, has a left bias but has high factual reporting which is better than both fox news and cnn.
while the name is certainly odd, their still a reliable news source kind've like lawnewz which they always bitch about too.
they bitch about any publication that defies their pre-concieved biases.
&gt; *while the name is certainly odd, their still a reliable news source[.
]* \*they are (they**'**a**re**) still a reliable news source seriously sure, but the actual sources they quote don't count, i guess?
why not use the actual sources then?
is it a plug for this site that collects donations?
&gt; why not use the actual sources then?
you mean tweets and quotes?
what, exactly, do you think journalism is?
to those folks?
journalism is made up conspiracy bullshit, proclaimed to the masses via youtube videos with heavily moderated comment sections.
because any news that isn't saying what they want to hear, is fake news.
can i have your mailing address please.
wait, didn't the russian intel agencies supply "dirt" on trump when paid by dnc thru gps fusion?
didn't obama admin then use that fake "intel" as an excuse to tap political opponents' phones during and election year?
no.

wrong.
the never trump gop did hire mudslinger gps, but well before the steele dossier were commissioned.
that was done purely on the dnc contract.
you're treating the paper results of the investigation as separate from the investigation itself.
the dossier is the summary of findings from research started by republicans.
the dossier is the product of british spy using russian intel assets to fabricate info about trump, much of which already discredited.
that did not begin until the dnc contract.
republicans, like mccain did get access to the dossier and used it against trump.
why would a british spy use russian intel assets to fabricate info?
is he supposed to be too stupid to think up lies himself?
you people will say anything no matter how fucking absurd.
talk about no sense of shame whatsoever.
you gave it your best shot sweetie.
&gt;much of which already discredited oh i'm sorry how exactly was he vindicated?
i seemed to have missed that with all the constant lying and strange bullshit declarations of privilege and former campaign manager getting arrested for laundering tens of millions of dollars linked to russia's invasion of the ukraine and national security advisor pleading guilty to lying to the fbi about sanctions and must i keep fucking going?
should i bring up felix sater?
wilbur ross?
tillerson?
what from the dossier has actually been explicitly "discredited"?
the closest trumpists have done is ignore the document and just pretend it came entirely from clinton.
because fuck if you people have ever given a fuck about reality.
so, right off, your second source is extreme right propaganda that lacks sources for their stories.
additionally, the napoliano "dish" earned him a suspension from fox news because there was no evidence of what he claimed.
getting suspended from fox news for anti-democrat news takes a hefty breach of trust.
you realize your whole theory falls apart when your sources aren't reliable, right?
sure - the dems played dirty - no surprise there - but that does not excuse treason for anyone.
the dems did not play dirty enough it seems - fighting evil is hard when the tactics required are despicable.
the magas and the gop support treason and pedophiles now - they will support any evil to get what they want.
whataboutism time already?
well, as you say "lock him up", right?
wouldn't want to be...what's that pc term you guys use for hypocrite?
"virtue signaling", there it is.
whataboutism implies that the things he is comparing it to exists... you can't 'whatabout' fiction.
"trump jr. lied?
what about unicorns?!"...
this doesn't work.
what he is doing is not a whataboutism, it's plain lying.
whataboutism = pointing out hypocrisy and double standards, pointing out a nothingburger as compared to actually colluding with russian intel and using that fake intel as an excuse to attempt to steal an election with help from wiretapping by govt spy apparatus, as obama/hillary admin did.
what you're saying, when you bring up things other people have done and got away with is that you feel the current person/administration should get a pass because someone else got a pass.
that's the issue, we can be outraged at instances of improper conduct on both sides, but that doesn't mean we should just stop trying to stop the problem altogether.
oh!
it's crazy conspiracy time?!
trump is in cahoots with the space aliens!
they'd rather not address those issues, so they just scream 'whataboutism!!!'
over and over to deflect from actually crimes committed by their team.
screams of organized propaganda.
no and no, but thank you for trying.
can i have your mailing address please no and no.
any other questions?
wait, are you even real?
do you believe a foreign power should be able to influence the outcome of a us federal election?
do you believe a us citizen should be able to collude with a foreign power to influence the outcome of a us federal election?
&gt; *wait, didn't the russian intel agencies supply "dirt" on trump when paid by dnc thru gps fusion?
* wait, i just fell off my chair laughing.
out loud.
sooo many (self-serving) errors in such a short sentence.
'russian intel agencies' didn't supply shit - in fact it is probable they assisted in the 'accidental' deaths of those russians that spilled the beans to christopher steele - just a few weeks after the trump dossier began becoming public.
what you are thinking of is the **former** head of the russia desk (where any russia-related intel is routed) for british mi-6 (their equivalent to the cia), christopher steele, who had since retired and was now a private british citizen with his own private investigative agency (that relied heavily on a network of spies and sources throughout europe that he had created and/or nurtured when still active) that was contracted by gps fusion to travel to moscow in search of trump dirt.
and christopher steel (the mi-6 person in question) had been chosen by gps fusion at the behest of a wealthy **republican** who did not want to see trump become the republican pick.
later, after steel's report began making it's way around the washington cocktail-party set (shortly before it became public), the dnc took up support for steel's contract after the republican donor bowed out (because the info steele dug up was way too hot to handle in the conventional way of opposition dirt).
&gt; *didn't obama admin then use that fake "intel" as an excuse to tap political opponents' phones during and election year?
* no, no and **no**.
that is utterly "fake news", completely made-up by your boy (who offered nothing, zip, nada is support of such an outrageous claim other than his word alone).
and i'll interject this: as a former counter-intelligence officer and agent myself, be aware that all of the various us intelligence agencies have, literally since the day of those agencies inception, studiously avoided involving themselves in internal us politics.
that's just a matter of self-preservation.
if congress ever found out an internal us intelligence agency was working to shape the outcome of us elections, they would eliminate the agency, because we would no longer be able to say we had a democracy.
there are plenty of people in government that feel very strongly about that last.
who would obama get to carry out these 'wiretaps'?
the fbi, cia, or nsa would all turn him down as an illegal act unless there was a warrantable 'probable cause'.
and if there was a warrantable 'probable cause', there would be no need to take it to potus - they could act on their own as routine business any time there is actual 'probable cause'.

a candidate or his staff trying to find dirt on their opponent is in no way illegal, and despite what you may tell yourselves, if it is proven does not mean hillary is automatically president.... yea, that isn't the issue.
the problem is the trump campaign (private citizens) offering political favors to hostile countries.
no, it's not illegal to look for dirt on opponents.
*who* they went to for the dirt, and *what* they offered them in return, is the issue.
nice straw man.
nobody is saying that.
because we all think that if trump is impeached then hillary is president...okay...fucking retard... actually soliciting a donation of money or anything of value from another country to assist with a political campaign is a clear violation of campaign finance laws.
parties pay good money for "dirt", hence the value.
making deals to settle national disputes prior to trump's election is also a violation of the logan act.
beyond being illegal, to coordinate anything with a country hostile to your own in order to mutually increase your power would normally be regarded as a form of treason, whether the trumps are charged with anything that specific or not.
&gt; *... is in no way illegal...* yes, 'way' - and such a claim is a very common method of 'hide the sausage' used by trump boys.
there are severe constraints on the things candidates or their staff are permitted to do, and one of those things is accepting any form of assistance from foreign governments.
would you really have it any other way, or do you want canada, or mexico... or pakistan or north korea, or the entire rest of the world working to get the candidate they wish to see elected?
because otherwise it would make the election not for us president, but who will head the 'new world order'?
onward, bullshit soldier!!
no one's sting hillary would get the presidency.
hell i doubt anyone even wants her anymore.
compared to other developed nations, this is an entirely different animal here in japan.
because of the lack of religious fervor, there isn’t much discrimination.
however, the overwhelming opinion is that homosexuality (the gay variation) is disgusting.
it’s not a “this goes against god” type thing, but just “let’s ignore this”.
much harder to gather sympathy.
this also applies for some european nations, as they are less religious than america progressive support depends on which european country you are talking about, and where you are in the us.
poland for example is full of religious fascists that make utah look progressive.
the uk has never fully legalized gay marriage because of northern ireland.
switzerland still has not legalized gay marriage, and germany and australia both dragged behind the us for 2 years.
if you want examples of places in europe that are extremely progressive, sweden, norway, denmark, and iceland are great examples.
you could also take the west coast of the us and it would be more progressive than most of europe tbf i'd much rather be gay in switzerland than gay in the american south east.
i live in south carolina and it's really not bad at all.
no one has ever attacked me or vandalized my house/car; the most "hate" i ever get is an occasional dirty look when my husband and i are holding hands.
however, i am also somewhat straight-presenting (other than having pierced ears); it might be different if i was wearing tight crop tops, leggings, and sparkly, multicolored wigs.
yeah, politicians talk shit about marriage equality or whatever to try to get the evangelical vote but that is not exclusive to the southeast.
my biggest issue is that my city doesn't have any gay bars, but there are gay nights at some bars and we get "famous" drag queens coming through occasionally.
and i'd rather be gay in san francisco than switzerland.
i'd rather be gay and not have to worry about where i live some day i hope that is true everywhere you mean the south?
los angeles is in the technical south, but when people refer to the south they mean the south-east.
yeah but support for gay marriage was higher in germany than in the us; the us didn't legalize it through parliament that's true, we do have a majority support here now luckily.
i'm happy for the people of germany that can finally get married.
on northern ireland most people here do want legal gay marriage but one party who are a bunch of cunts keeps blocking which, because they no longer have the required amount of elected representatives, they can no longer do so hopefully whenever we actually have a god damn government again it will go through who would have thought the vikings would have ended up the chillest out of everyone?
they must have taken all the best people home with them on raids &gt;the uk has never fully legalized gay marriage because of northern ireland.
dup: we won't tolerate being treated in any way differently to the rest of the uk dup: not like that as an italian... hahaha ha (sob) &gt; however, the overwhelming opinion is that homosexuality (the gay variation) is disgusting.
it's comical considering how it used to be accepted in the past.
samurai commonly had homosexual relations, and even big famous historical figures like oda nobunaga had male lovers.
&gt;it's comical considering how it used to be accepted in the past.
it never was.
neither in japan nor in rome and in other places.
people who had power at those times did much more than just having same sex partners.
children, animals, dead, the shit they did would make head spinning, having gay partner in sex was part of that.
even being lesbian was basically impossible outside of being prostitute.
the modern understanding love especially when it comes to sex is simply not something you can apply to those times.
especially when you use nobility or people of power as "average" population at the time.
they were like 0.00001% or less of total population.
naturally there were cases of genuine love here and there but you can't say "how it used to be accepted in the past."
because it wasn't and we have shitload of cases where actual gay couples ended up miserably if they were not protected by some power behind them.
in rome and greece it was even more alien.
they didn't even have concepts of gay and straight but masculine and effeminate.
shagging another man didn't make you gay it made him womanly.
in many greek cities and somewhat in rome it was socially acceptable to have these relationships between grown men and prepubescent boys.
or a man and his male slave, since it was not shameful for a boy to be less masculine than a grown man and no one gave a crap about slaves.
tl;dr prison rules.
yeah i was thinking of mentioning prison rape today which is pretty similar.
those who rape in prison do not consider themselves gay much like people in those times just because fucked some kid didn't consider themselves gay.
it was more sex for sex itself rather than some relationship based on love or something.
hedonism is what you're referring too.
while true in the main there are some exceptions.
emperor hadrian has his "boy" actually a young man who it seemed he genuinely loved.
&gt; even being lesbian was basically impossible outside of being prostitute.
it was impossible in the sense of marriage, sure.
but that's because of family structures reliant on family alliances, not rejection of homosexuality itself.
&gt;the modern understanding love especially when it comes to sex is simply not something you can apply to those times.
that literally applies to *straight relationships* in "those times" as well.
marriage was a *duty* to the family.
but by your own line of reasoning *any love at all* was "never accepted."
the romans openly ridiculed nobles that were known to hold genuine affection for their spouses.
but this isn't the same as "straight relationships were never accepted".
your overall point is pretty vague.
&gt;they were like 0.00001% or less of total population.
your exaggerations do not help your attempted point, particularly not when it is *well known* that the "behavior" of the nobility when it came to same-sex relationships was adopted by the japanese middle-class in the tokugawa era.
&gt;naturally there were cases of genuine love here and there but you can't say "how it used to be accepted in the past."
you seem to have made up your own ideas of what is meant.
fact is, people like nobunaga were *never* frowned upon for their same-sex relationships, even those they had while conventionally married.
and as other people have said, japanese culture generally is just *indifferent* to homosexuality, as they have no religious background for it.
the perceptions of homosexuality as "immoral" is mostly imported if anything, as is largely notion that it needs to be legally recognized as well.
&gt; your exaggerations do not help your attempted point, particularly not when it is well known that the "behavior" of the nobility when it came to same-sex relationships was adopted by the japanese middle-class in the tokugawa era.
source on this?
i'm in no way doubting you - it just sounds like an engaging read, on a topic i'm not at all familiar with.
&gt;it was impossible in the sense of marriage, sure.
but that's because of family structures reliant on family alliances, not rejection of homosexuality itself.
it was impossible in any kind of sense.
family was everything in those times and outside of family you couldn't exist (in sense we are talking about homeless people now).
parents mostly decided who will have sex with whom and outside of that arrangement or kids being kids rarely stints without parents approval happened much less same sex ones which would put shadow on whole family.
like i said there were cases of people having same sex relationship.
which is normal considering how vast earth is and how many people dwell on it but saying people of older times respected that is simply false statement mostly based on high nobility and their practices.
those people could just kill people who they didn't like so they could what they hell they want (i mentioned already fucking children animals and so on).
they didn't follow society laws or commons and the higher power they wielded they higher usually debauchery followed.
like catarina of russia who fucked everything in her sight (including women) and killed those who didn't like it.
&gt;that literally applies to straight relationships in "those times" as well.
marriage was a duty to the family.
but by your own line of reasoning any love at all was "never accepted."
the romans openly ridiculed nobles that were known to hold genuine affection for their spouses.
but this isn't the same as "straight relationships were never accepted".
your overall point is pretty vague.
i think you are confusing something here.
romans did that because it was normal to have wife or few wives and concubines (and this wasn't really only for romans mind you) but that didn't apply for male sex partners.
&gt;you seem to have made up your own ideas of what is meant.
fact is, people like nobunaga were never frowned upon for their same-sex relationships because people like nobunaga would kill those who sneer at him.
he would also rape wife before her husband like he did kill her and her baby at that.
like i said do not treat behavior of those in power as principle how people lived at those times.
it would be like trying to establish how people behaved in 21 century by observing us congress.
the true comedy lies in realizing which country (countries) brought this attitude of extreme prejudice against gay people into japan.
was it the netherlands?
it'll be the greeks, they're the ones who invented gayness.
damn those stupid sexy greeks!
it's not the greeks, it's the chinese he's after!
i hear you're a homophobe now, father.
how'd ye get into that sort of thing?
this type of attitude needs to die, fast.
open homosexuality was not generally tolerated in japanese society, just as it wasn't in europe (despite there being similar homosexual relations between prominent individuals).
in fact, open tolerance of homosexuality is, and has been, incredibly rare.
the modern attitude to lgbt issues is exactly that, modern.
i heard somewhere (the usual "i heard" with no source!
:-)) that alexander the great's (supposed gay) relationship was only accepted (more like tolerated) because he was alexander the great.
like, you could have some sexytimes with young men/teenagers/whatever as need be, fine, but you were still supposed to get married to a woman and father some kids.
yeah let's not give japanese people any agency, it's entirely the us's responsibility netherlands and portugal* the netherlands (first country to legalize gay marriage) changed and so can japan, muh colonialism is the dumbest meme alive definitely when it's concerning japan that wasn't even colonised and outlawed christianity.
get over your colonial guilt complex yeah stupid japanese do whatever foreigners tell them.
edit: sigh.
/s.
i think the attitude is illustrated above is silly and somewhat derogatory to everyone involved.
japan's borders were closed for far longer than other nations at the time, and that's when homosexuality was more embraced.
what op is trying to say is, how soon after the borders opened did a country visit and bring an ideology that changed their minds, and what country was it?
portuguese, and the dutch were first.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_westerners_who_visited_japan_before_1868 looks like both the english and the dutch came in 1600; can’t find exact dates to see who won the race for second place.
&gt; and what country was it?
i don't know.
but.
i'm going to guess, was it america?
**open.
the country.
** **stop.
having gays be ok.** i was basically reading this thread just looking for this reference.
mission complete.
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ how bout sun rise land!
actually portugal originally spread christianity to japan.
yeah but he didn't marry his gay lovers my understanding is that in feudal japan you could be as gay as you like.
so long as you got married and had children for the good of the family.
it's the same situation in mainland china, homosexuality was quite common in ancient china, it was even a fashion among aristocracy in some dynasties.
however, i believe it was during the [10 years cultural revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/cultural_revolution), homosexuality was deemed as a dreadful behavior from old culture and needed to be exterminated just like what the government did to any other ancient culture(relics, arts, literature).
(need to mention that there was never an official law against homosexuality, it's more like the entire country obey one man's order.)
even my father's family's pedigree and other legacy were all burnt to ashes by [red guards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_guards).
but after that 10 years, everything goes like many countries, the chinese government first deemed homosexuality as a mental disease, then just says it's an inappropriate behavior.
it wasn't an identity though.
this is what modern propaganda has so successfully made people misunderstand even though the information is right in their faces.
gang or mob members in prison fuck each other in the ass but they are not seen as being gay neither while inside nor when they get released.
it is something they do for establishing dominance hierarchies and simply as a better alternative to masturbation.
being gay as in that being your identity, on the other hand, is a completely different thing.
and that does actually have deeply corrosive effects on societal cohesion, which is why there are very good reasons for one to be against having it promoted by the mainstream culture that have nothing to do with religion.
as people in east asia demonstrate.
&gt; and that does actually have deeply corrosive effects on societal cohesion can you give some evidence for this claim?
also, yaoi comics are somewhat popular those are generally aimed at girls/young women.
also probably not something they would show their friends/parents.
you sound like they are happy to share their vanilla porn with parents there's plenty of yaoi mangas that aren't porn but just romance.
(although the proper term is shounen ai i think) incest-theme porn is popular, too.
and kids no less china is no different but people think that the only argument against it can come from fanatics.
not much discrimination?
you know that attitude against women and gaijin right?
not many countries will apartments and jobs tell you to your face we don't allow your type based on skin color directly to your face with no shame.
&gt; there isn’t much discrimination lol &gt; there isn’t much discrimination &gt; the overwhelming opinion is that homosexuality (the gay variation) is disgusting there seems to be some conflicting things here.
i think he meant that people don’t really care if other people are homosexual, rather they think it is disgusting to be homosexual themselves.
so it is not like they will discriminate against homosexuals but for the majority, the idea of them being homosexual is disgusting.
sounds counter-intuitive?
imagine this: i don’t care if *you* are gay but *i* found the idea of *me* being gay is disgusting.
so i am offended if you think *i* am gay, but i don’t mind if *you* are gay.
though japan really should fix their attitude to women first.
&gt; imagine this: i don’t care if you are gay but i found the idea of me being gay is disgusting.
so i am offended if you think i am gay, but i don’t mind if you are gay.
let me rephrase and see if it's discrimination: imagine this: i don't care if *you* are black, but i find the idea of *me* having been born black disgusting.
disgust is a pretty powerful word that usually doesn't insinuate neutral feelings towards people who are related to it.
conservatism is conservatism whether its under the guise of religion or not.
religion is (often) an excuse to be prejudiced, not a reason in and of itself.
actually studies show [disgust](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/02/how-the-mind-rationalizes-homophobia/283998/) is the most commonly felt feeling about homosexuality.
people have a lot of predispositions about being gay.
there was an elderly couple that my wife used to work for who were gay.
one had really bad knees and the other was wheelchair bound.
they never had sex with each other... probably in their entire life.
but they still received a pretty disproportionate amount of vitriol over gay sex.
tbh i think it is like that everywhere but only in japan they actually say it aloud publicly.
in other countries religion is just used as an excuse that you say when people ask you about it while deep down the "disgustingness" is the actual reason.
many of the homophobes i've seen will talk about "them" doing this nasty thing which in their minds should be capital offense.
only when you really push them do they bring the bible into the mix.
but if it is a more public setting, like a facebook post or whatever they'll always come with the religious reason first (look at me, i'm a good christian and gays should burn in hell) and you need to dig in a bit to get the actual disgust comments.
because once they run out of religious excuses (most of them don't even know about leviticus, they barely know it is in the bible) they finally say what they really think.
how it is said is a perception thing.
people want to be seen in certain way.
people want to seem like they are doing something because of some valiant reason (my religion) and not just because they disapprove certain kind of acts (those filthy sex acts).
religion is also the absolute perfect tool for this because saying the words "because my religion" instantly makes it impossible for others to critique your opinion at that point.
religious views are totally beyond limits for many people and people know this and abuse it.
i think japan however has much better chances of getting this wrong righted quickly than everybody else because by not being about religion it can be discussed.
for example there are lots of things that can be viewed as disgusting that are accepted.
disgust is a dangerous thing to talk about publicly though.
lots of people want to appear pure and righteous and will without hesitation judge anything that the people around them also seem to judge even if they themselves engage in those acts on daily basis.
this can make lots of people turn into hypocrites when the reality and the ideals have nothing to do with each other.
yet all they have to argue is their own ideals.
&gt; homosexuality (the gay variation) is there a straight variation of homosexuality?
well, there is the lesbian variant.... gay women are still pretty gay, yo.
i often associated the word ‘gay’ with men and ‘lesbian’ for women.
if they have an unknown or a non-binary gender, i prefer ‘homosexuality’.
gay is a gender neutral term though, while lesbian is exclusively female.
if they have an unknown or non-binary gender, how can they be homosexuals?
do they only date other unknown or non-binary gendered individuals?
well, til gay is gender-neutral.
i thought it was exclusively male.
well, those people who identified themselves as non-binary gender can love each other.
also, it is unknown for me, but it might be a fact that they are homosexuals to each other.
edit: brainfarted male to female.
its also not used to mean just homosexuality, its often used as an umbrella term including bi people.
then, why is there so much yaoi out there, damnit?
based on anime and manga, i thought they just considered gay men and crossdressing men "taboo funny," the same way we talk about mentally retarded people.
you aren't necessarily wrong.
that being said, it's more accepted (culturally) by the younger group of kids that are more likely to indulge in anime and manga.
when i went to japan that was one thing i noticed quickly.
it seems like a very reserved country with incredibly... lets say "classical" gender roles and all that.
struck me as odd for a country with so much beauty, perfection, and technological impressiveness that their people felt so repressed in many ways.
great time though.
&gt; their people felt so repressed in many ways.
maybe that's the key.
they've been repressed in some ways so their expression in other areas bursts forth.
i've always been enraptured by their games and stories since i was a child.
yeah, that's very likely.
they have a working culture so at night the cities seem to come alive.
i think being somewhat repressed definitely has something to do with it.
i personally love horror and i think japan is one of the last places to make truly disturbing shit in their media, which i really appreciate.
you should know people get fired for being gay in japan.
you can get completely ostracized socially for being gay.
even in sapporo where gay marriage is 'legalized'.
laws won't change this.
japanese deem success through your ability to be desireable to the opposite sex.
hell if you are single working at a company you will likely never get promoted from your entry level position.
&gt;hell if you are single working at a company you will likely never get promoted from your entry level position.
that's a massive generalisation and one which i've not seen backed up by personal experience.
those are some extraordinary claims, got some extraordinary evidence?
you can be refused employment, a bank account, housing for being gay because japan has no anti-discrimination laws.
being gay in osaka or tokyo isn't bad but elsewhere it can be difficult.
however i do think that japan does a lot better at giving lgbt people a platform on mainstream media.
i've seen way more shows on japanese tv where lgbt people can talk about issues they face etc than in the uk.
i've never seen a regular uk show dedicated to lgbt community but i have in japan.
some people might say that some of them are selling out and making a mockery of themselves but without that exposure people will never be able to familiarise themselves with the community.
[deets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_in_japan#discrimination_protections) &gt; hell if you are single working at a company you will likely never get promoted from your entry level position.
depends where, where i did my internship nobody in my ~20 people team was married, including managers.
even in other teams, there were many single men.
&gt;however, the overwhelming opinion is that homosexuality (the gay variation) is disgusting.
that's bullshit.
i love how the top comment on reddit is the one making a blanket statement about 127 million people without evidence of any kind.
i really hate this "i was an english teacher in osaka for a year and a bit and *let me tell you 'gaijins' about my expert knowledge of japan*!"
attitude.
it's a diverse country with a huge range of opinions on the matter.
there are also way more lgbtq people in the public eye in japan, and far greater acceptance of non-binary people in general.
&gt;it's a diverse country lmao i'm fairly sure they think it's a phase, rather than disgusting, but again it's probably the uniformity in the japanese and most asian countries that are the reason people frown upon it.
though, as far as i'm aware people just leave people alone.
yeah it's weird.
there are extremely popular gay/trans celebrities, yet a lot of people are grossed out by those things in everyday life.
japanese culture is all about what's normal or abnormal based on the situation, so if there's a gay person on tv, most people are fine with it because there's a certain "distance" between them and the audience.
if that same person wasn't a celebrity and lived in an average neighborhood, many of his neighbors would think he was a weirdo.
i took japanese in college and i would talk with my tutor about her home country of japan all the time.
she said the same thing you did, that homosexuality is largely ignored.
but the reasoning was because that japan is full of traditionalist, there's a clear view that you grow up, get married and have kids, and homosexuality just doesn't fit in with that lifestyle.
i guess the idea is that they'll grow out of it and do what's right for the family.
they may want to work on getting some heterosexual marriages too.
from recent reports, everyone is too tired to care anymore about working on a relationship there.. that's possibly a secondary factor in the prejudice against it.
we laugh when religious conservatives here claim that legal gay sex will mean there's no reason for anyone to procreate, because it's a preposterous notion.
but in japan the prospect (preposterous or not) of anything undercutting the *already* low birth rate would be even more frustrating to an already angry older population.
(though their prejudice is still inexcusable.)
i'm not sure i've heard that argument from conservatives before.
surely they must know they're grasping at straws if that's what they try to claim.
the government recognising same sex marriage would have extremely little/no bearing at all on whether heterosexual couples decide to have children or not working on a relationship?
heck, people are too tired to have sex!
how overworked do you have to be to fall to that level!?
but... but that would ruin all the drama in my favorite yuri mangas !!!
more seriously good luck to them, i'm not sure they'll ever get it this decade but at least civil unions would be nice... you didn't read the memo, yuri = awesome!
yaoi = ewww oh boy.
wait till you find out about gengoroh tagame.
i refuse to google it.
i have a bad feeling.
from wikipedia: &gt;gengoroh tagame is an openly gay japanese manga artist.
the bulk of his work has consisted of gay bdsm erotic manga, many of which depict graphic violence, featuring hypermasculine, often bearish men.
my brother's husband is a really good and totally wholesome manga, i definitely recommend it, especially if you're interested in the subject of being gay in japan.
not as bad as i thought.
thank you kindly ... read the rest of it.
so it begins, my decent into darkness.
compared to some other artists that have come up recently, gengoroh tagame is starting to look more and more vanilla.
i dunno.
have you really seen any of his more extreme work?
let's just say the term "deep fat fried fuck nugget" doesn't describe the most extreme thing i've seen from him.
dude, my brother's husband was great.
the only thing that irks me is that the scanlation group translating it stopped at volume 3, after an official english version came out... so i guess i'm going to have to wait like five years to see how it ends :( that's why the ice skating anime is called yuri on ice instead of yaoi on ice.
oh i don't know about that.
if the lgbt community could somehow get every fujoshi to vote in droves, gay marriage would be legalized within a week.
thank you.
yuri is top-tier purity.
never has there been a more true statement.
if i could, i'd throw [some gold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dofanpb8i3e) your way.
it did make for a pretty good expansion.
you watch/read yuri?
[good taste confirmed!
](https://i.imgur.com/eucifyy.gif) also, it could mean more marriage within yuri works which is pureness incarnate.
i see you both are men of culture, also.
m'anga.
good luck.
part of the reason i'm leaving japan is because there is no future here in terms of love it long-term flfillment.
i loved my job, and i love the friends i have here.
but, being a foreigner isn't what gets me... it's the loneliness and that i'll never be able to truly be equal with my partner here.
random flings can only hold off the loneliness for so long.
that stability really would make living here easier.
but, alas... well, at least i am still leaving while i still have a fondness for this strange island.
rather than staying another decade and growing bitter and alone.
as i've said in another thread some time ago: japan is a totally nice place to visit but not a place you'd want to live in the long term as a foreigner.
good luck with your future life.
as someone living here who can speak japanese, i disagree.
foreigners can have a totally wonderful life here if they bother to learn the damn language.
you will never be japanese though.
sure, you might in paper (eventually), but never in society.
doesn't that apply to any immigrant living somewhere other than their home country?
i guess it's easier in some countries to become "-an/-ese".
i know for a fact that it is way harder if not impossible in japan.
friends have tried, but they would comment that while they were always welcome, they would also encounter a bit of xenophobia.
then again, this was years ago, and the world has changed, so... no.
in a lot of ways yes.
but it is much easier to integrate and become accepted in most other countries in the world as a foreigner compared to japan.
i think it does apply.
my parents are immigrants in canada, which is often touted as the model of acceptance and multiculturalism, and even they say that it is impossible for them to truly feel like *canadians*.
they love canada, they speak english very well, and they have lived here for 20+ years, but at the end of the day there is a gulf of experience between them and people who are born and raised in canada.
there are different cultural landmarks and references which they lack, and different customs.
however, it is certainly easier in certain countries than others.
before they lived in canada, my parents had immigrated to and lived in germany, and they say that canadians are much more accepting and inclusive than germans were.
so?
that happens in europe, too.
my aunt moved to the uk (scotland specifically) to be with her husband and despite living their for over twenty years everyone still calls her ''the american''.
much of europe including the uk still has a bit of the classical worlds "you are what you speak".
that said in the uk you can be accepted as british rather easily but to be accepted as english/ scottish/ welsh takes a deeper connection than a piece of paper.
to the point there are other british identities beyond the four obvious ones.
i am still amazed that people presume to demand an identity as a people that they did not originate from.
like.... why does it matter to you whether the japanese think of you as japanese?
you really are not japanese, but... so what?
is there something wrong with not being japanese?
i could see it being important for people who grew up in the country but have foreign parents perhaps.
if you move there as an adult though it’s a dumb thing to concern yourself with.
unfortunately to many japanese people, and even the government, there is something wrong with not being japanese &gt; is there something wrong with not being japanese?
no but you might be treated negatively because of it.
i think it's less that people want to be accepted as 'being japanese' but more that they want to be seen as equal citizens.
if you're a permanent resident working in the country, speak the language, pay your taxes you should expect to be treated as any other citizen.
foreigners, from what i understand, are treated as second class citizen when it comes to renting, owning property, opening a bank account, custody battles, criminal justice etc.
it sounds like a subtly hostile system that doesn't encourage outsiders to truly feel at home or accepted in the country.
they are hostile.
i've lived in japan for years.
there isn't anywhere else on earth more racist, hateful, judgmental and exclusive.
japan... is not likely to change ever.
the thing for foreigners to do is to stop going there with wildly unrealistic expectations.
japan is not like the west, it does not share the same fundamental values and philosophical premises or social contract.
you need to deal with that fact **before** going.
welcome to american life for just about every american-born asian.
"where are you from?"
"uhhh, new jersey" you will always be second class to them.
they won't ever consider you japanese the way americans consider immigrants american i think you overestimate how much americans think of immigrants, or their children, or their grandchildren, as american.
for example, i know a bunch of people in my rural, white family do not consider racially asian people to be as american as they are.
and they aren't even particularly racist from a relative standpoint.
well yeah that's rural people.
in the city i'm indian but no one questions me being american i would have to disagree there.
the people who feel the biggest barriers suck at speaking japanese.
you can't expect to have deep connections with other and become accepted if you don't even speak their language.
i know a lot of friends/family friends, fluent in japanese, and/or part japanese, and/or even lived in japan for decades, but still left because they were never fully accepted (legally and socially).
which is why they're here in canada now.
i would like to reply to this comment because this is something that seems to be fought against as a major conception.
i agree with this, not just from an experience standpoint, but my buddy in our field worked side-by-side on our theses and his was essentially about this topic, while i had an accompanying topic about inner-national social rejection.
it was essentially about social withdrawal because in studying japan, the country is defined as a group-conscious society.
there are also legal ways that japan may distinguish you as a member of society, even for people born here who may be korean, and sometimes even against japanese people.
agreed.
their stance on gay marriage helped me stay grounded for the time i was here.
i could never 'get comfortable.'
i consider it both a curse and a blessing.
depends.
i think it's hard to fit in to japanese culture because there's not as much of a diversity in japan, so yeah you'll forever be recognized as a foreigner.
but it's true for any other country that's homogeneous, i think japan is just extreme.
but i wouldn't say that you can't enjoy a life in japan.
you can hang out with people who recognize you more as a person rather than a foreigner.
if you just hang out with the "mainstream" people you're not going to have a good time.
speaking fluent japanese and understanding their culture can go a long way.
also some areas of japan are more friendlier than others (i believe the south is a lot more friendly).
just for reference, where were you from originally?
just now i am learning a bit of japanese for a trip i am doing with friends and i can say, writing it is a complete bitch.
i wouldn’t even worry about writing honestly.
99% of the time you’ll be speaking, reading or typing.
ok, let me extend on a bit.
just speaking it seems easy enough, like other languages, you learn the sound and memorize vocabulary and a few grammar rules.
the true bitch part are kanji when reading, there is hiragana, then katakana, then kanji and some kanji are pronounced differently depending on context or sound the same as other kanji but mean different things... its freaking nuts.
no way will this happen.
rewriting the constitution will be easier.
gay marriage would require the overhaul of the koseki system which is the foundation of all government services and relations with the population.
&gt;there is huge institutional opposition in this country.
allowing same-sex marriage would require a complete revision, if not outright abandonment, of the family registry system.
both the abe government and [the courts](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/16/japanese-court-rules-married-women-cannot-keep-their-surnames) have repeatedly proven that they are not interested in making any changes.
&gt;as was mentioned in the article, one spouse (generally women) must change their name.
[another issue is that foreigners are not allowed to have their own koseki, nor are they allowed to be officially entered on to their japanese spouses.
](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2016/07/10/issues/japans-discriminatory-koseki-registry-system-looks-ever-outdated/) instead their marriage is listed in the notes section, and even this is relatively new.
it wasn't that long ago that japanese woman (married to a non-japanese man) was considered single mother and her children were considered illegitimate.
which is another problem, koseki identifies people as legitimate or not.
another issues is paternity, as [the biological father is often not recognized as the legal father](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2015/12/06/how-tos/japanese-law-theres-paternity-dna/) and vice versa.
there is also the issue of surrogate mothers who are legally considered to be the mother of the child and not the actual mother.
&gt;the list just goes on and on.
changing the family registry system to allow same-sex marriage would bring up a whole host of other issues and the government is just not interested.
this information is out of date.
true, back in the 80's-90's when i got married in japan i showed up in the notes section of my wife's koseki but with change in various laws i'm now listed as spouse and father of my children in our new koseki.
jeez.. it's like they're trying to kill their own country.
either people won't get married or people will leave to marry/live bc the laws are so fucked for women, ex pats, and lgbtq.
bruh, i can marry a virtual girl but not another man.
what even?
i thought japan was asexual.
as a taiwanese, i can't be more proud that we're being a pioneer in legalizing same sex marriage!
hopefully japan would be the second country in asia to do so!
do you reckon the rest will?
i cant imagine either china or japan doing so.
this is the best tl;dr i could make, [original](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/12/07/national/social-issues/lgbt-advocates-push-nationwide-recognition-sex-marriage/) reduced by 87%.
(i'm a bot) ***** &gt; calls are growing in japan for same-sex marriage to be legalized so lgbt couples can enjoy the same benefits that heterosexual couples do.
&gt; the u.s. supreme court recognized same-sex marriage as legal and deemed state-level bans unconstitutional in 2015, but the constitutional court of taiwan ruled this year that the civil code, which stipulates that marriage is the legal union between a man and a woman, is unconstitutional.
&gt; suzuki said he had not necessarily taken a positive stance toward introducing same-sex marriage because he had &amp;quot;a negative image of marriage itself,&amp;quot; citing, for example, the predominant but &amp;quot;unfair&amp;quot; institution of women taking the husband&amp;#039;s surname after marriage.

the netherlands has had equal marriage since 2001. it is an english language news site for a japan, so it is probably partially aimed at a us audience or japanese readers with an interest in the us, so it is giving context for the us.
and taiwan is comparable as the first east asian country to legalize same sex mariage.
also, the us and japan have close ties so us policies are probably of interest to the japanese readers.
lesbianism is far more accepted (still quite low however) in larger japanese society then homosexual men.
i’m going to push for a sandwich shop selling lgbt blt’s.
lgbt sandwich (lettuce, guacamole, bacon, tomato) i thought an lgbt sandwich was some kind of orgy?
why not both?
that actually sounds good.
considering 4 other countries have done it this year alone, why not?
because the situation is different in asia.
people are more socially conservative.
but who knows, maybe it's going to happen in the next years in japan or taiwan.
would be great.
already on the way in taiwan - http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40012047 honest question — how does it feel for homophobic people to be on the "wrong side of history" at this point?
or at what point does it become the "wrong side of history" for them?
i'd hope that homophobes can at least look back at history and the civil rights movement and go "wow, people were awful", but how can they not apply that to their current situation?
how often have "________ rights" failed where we've gone, "oh wow, we were way off base about that"?
can't we just concede gay rights, trans rights, etc and just save us all a bunch of kicking and screaming?
it usually takes a generation to die out.
a lot of people don't change their minds - they just grow old and die, left in the past to be judged by the future population.
just look at how the australian marriage survey demographics turned out - a majority of the anti-equality votes came from senior citizens, and a huge proportion of pro-equality votes were from the millenial population.
this is why education is so important - teaching equality and understanding to kids is how we lead society towards the right side of history.
it's been slightly over a decade since we changed the law in spain and the overall shift in mentality has been huge imo.
there's still work to do obviously, but to me the difference feels like night and day.
i live in a big city and i'm not close to anyone lgbt though, so i might be totally off, but that's my perception.
with so much yaoi you would think theyd aprove it by now considering they call women who write and read it "fujoshi", literally "rotten girl", never.
to be fair, i think that’s more because they read fiction which (often to a disgusting degree) fetishises gay men written for women, made by women with pretty much no input from gay men themselves who have a much, much smaller selection of fiction, especially made in japan, which accurately depicts themselves and who they love in contrast.
also could not be because of that but either way, i think the term is often quite fitting.
&gt; fetishises gay men written for women, made by women with pretty much no input from gay men themselves who have a much, much smaller selection of fiction, especially made in japan, which accurately depicts themselves and who they love in contrast.
...thats not why they're called fujoshi.
it's a term coined by mass media because those women write/read gay fanfiction of popular anime/manga characters instead of holding real family values.
although the term has been reclaimed by the fandom itself, and even got variants in kifujin or ochofujin.
and about that last part, yeah no bara exists.
in fact barazoku/rose tribe exists arguably longer than mainstream yaoi, and artists like gengoroh tagame or gai mizuki have been around for a long long time, aswell as the g-men magazine.
the only thing thats different is that yaoi material is a lot more publicly visible simply due to the fact that its fanbase is more widely "accepted" and visible.
but that doesn't mean there is more material/no material on the other side at all, hell gengoroh tagame's otouto no otto even gets a live action tv-series spring next year on national tv.
as a woman who is into yaoi, we really are disgusting perverts.
as a man who is into yuri, so are we.
we're all sick perverts!
to the internet!
just watching anime and seeing how normalized anti-gay jokes are, it can't be too good to be gay in japan.
go team lgbt japan!
it doesn't help that at least half of the population in japan is over 50. they're in sore need of a feminist revolution as well.
japan is a great place, in some ways it's incredibly progressive but on the surface, it's always been very conservative.
as another commenter pointed out, it doesn't have much to do with religion and more to do with their culture in general.
really complex people.
(edit) not big fans of equality for women on this sub huh?
i think the problem is that a lot of people (here at least) equate "feminism" with things like "trigglypuff" and loud-mouthed swj/misandrists that have been given way too much showtime and not with the massive work that has been made so that women can be treated equally to men.
i assumed as much.
i think anyone who has spent some time in japan and has japanese friends knows what i mean.
surely there isn't much chance of this becoming law anytime in the near future?
nope, sadly.
asia is way too socially conservative.
wish there was some kind of cyber currency for gay marriage.
now would be a good time to invest.
i saw some gay people in japan, but i don't think i ever saw two gay people that were married they legally can't be, as in japan doesn't allow it nor recognizes marriages of that kind from other countries.
also japan: https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/07/japan-mystery-low-birth-rate/534291/
the policy of britain is to not apologize for past wrongs that go back so far that the person apologizing might not have been born.
in 1920 winston churchill described this massacre as "disgusting" and issued an informal apology to the indian people for it and promised better.
sweeping reforms came in shortly after.
david cameron when asked about this said that governments shouldn't "reach back into the past to look for things they can apologize for."
maybe this mayor should have checked up on things like that instead of grand standing and shooting his mouth off.
he's an opportunistic prick thats why.
if sadiq khan feels so guilty about what happened then perhaps he should apologize for it himself.
*sips tea* by george, i think you've got it!
thank you!
so sick of people backing him purely because he's not a tory.
he has absolutely no integrity.
indeed.
how quickly people forgot about his hate campaign against the ahmadiyya muslims back in 2010 [removed] &gt; winston churchill described this massacre as "disgusting" and issued an **informal apology** to the indian people for it.
&gt; mayor of london sadiq khan called on the british government on wednesday to make a **formal apology** for the 1919 jallianwala bagh massacre in which nearly 400 sikhs were shot dead by british indian army soldiers.
is that not a reasonable position?
britain never issued a formal apology for a massacre that happened less than 100 years ago.
i really don't see many reasons for why they shouldn't do it.
anybody who participated in the atrocity should definitely apologize.
nobody that participated in it is alive anymore i think that's his point.
i don't get how some people think "it's not policy" to be a valid excuse.
*why* is it not policy?
but... pretty much everybody involved is dead.
wooooosh [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] &gt; in 1920 winston churchill described this massacre as "disgusting" and issued an informal apology to the indian people for it and promised better.
sweeping reforms came in shortly after churchill condemned millions of indians to starve to death so saying that he was some sort of reformist in regards to the british raj's genocidal policies towards colonial india is just a flat out lie.
never said that, i said he apologized for this one thing.
c'mon mate, fess up.
your implication was that 'sweeping reforms happened' and things were rosy.
that's the connotation of 'sweeping'.
more like you were sweeping history under the rug to suit an apologist colonial attitude.
it all happened in the past guys, get over it.
generations of germans have been roasted over the coals with war guilt yet other european countries can't even muster a retrospective formal apology.
the connotation for "sweeping" is to clean something up... if you are talking about the word being used in the context of cleaning.
the context i am using is the main definition which is "affecting many things at once."
[just after the massacre the british put forth and passed a power sharing agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/government_of_india_act,_1919) called the government of india act, 1919. the act created an indian parliament representative of the people and a british governor.
the british governor could not make any laws he could only veto shit ones.
not one bill was vetoed.
they also rescended the [rowlatt act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rowlatt_act) which had been in effect since 1914. the reforms weren't even close to the promises made before the first world war.
self-governance in india was a little more than token .
that's why there shouldn't be a formal apology.
that will make it seem like britain and india are on good terms and have moved on, instead of continually hating each other for the actions of their grandfathers' fathers &gt;:o is that a false equivalence i detect?
i'm not sure generations of indian's repressed and exploited british subjects... also we're talking grandfathers for some of us, indian independence didn't happen until 1947. good thing the previous post mentions nothing of the sort i think purely blaming a man is ridiculous also.
the grain stores in the bengali famine weren't centralised.
burma had been captured by the japanese - one of british india's main food sources.
multiple things happened that caused the famine.
a nice quote of churchill about the bengal famine to understand the deep compassion he had for the victims and how guilty he felt about something entirely caused by the british: &gt; “i hate indians.
they are a beastly people with a beastly religion.
the famine was their own fault for breeding like rabbits.” when urged by some concerned british officials that millions will starve to death and that there was still time to avoid a horrible disaster, his answer was: &gt; "why hasn’t gandhi died yet?"
we're talking about the fucking prime minister of the fucking uk which was ruling india at the time, so hell yeah he takes the blame for it.
i don't get why some people can't accept that churchill, while being an essential leader in the allies victory of wwii, was also a despicable man with hands full of blood.
reforms in peace tend to go flying out the window during times of total war.
so it's hardly fair to say that unless you just don't give a fuck about the who's and whys and think everybody should apologize for everything man has ever done.
seriously you apologists annoy the ever living fuck out of me.
your use of apologists is ironic.
apologists doesn't mean people that apologise, it's actually people who try to defend the bad actions of others.
you might mean revisionist, which is where we update our history from the 'great european powers introducing civilisation to the savages' to more nuanced content of what actually happened (including the perspective of the other parties, imagine that!)
i don't get the issue of apologising, no-one has to feel guilt for the actions and context of our ancestors, it's about acknowledging *what actually happened*.
read a book.
i'm not an apologist, i'm indian.
some 30-40 million indians starved to death during the british raj while england looted the country of its wealth.
before england came famines never occurred in india on the scale they did during their reign.
they stockpiled food and shipped it away to other countries while some parts of india experienced famines so bad that a third of the population starved to death.
they forced starving farmers to grow food that was exported away instead of used to feed them.
they hated us and did not care how much the country suffered.
the country had a 12% literacy rate when it won its independence.
england did nothing to civilize india.
holy fuck.
exact same thing they did in ireland the problem with this and it's something people never mention for some reason.
yes technically it was considered a british colony, the problem is, it was actually a company that was given the task to rule, the british east india trading company".
the government only took direct rule in the late 1800's so can you really blame a country for the shit a company has done?
yea the stuff after it can be blamed on the government but again the government has apologized and spends money in india to help it's poor (despite your government saying it isn't needed).
the british today did nothing to the indians in the past, if anything they are welcome visitors and neighbours in our country.
sorry for the shit that happened in the past but me nor anybody else alive today should have to apologize over and over again.
why should i feel guilty by someone like you when i did nothing wrong?
move on, if you keep looking at your country and blame it on the british then you are like the british who blame the eu.
it's been 120 years, you have people who don't have basic needs for life and you are on the internet telling people around the world how bad they have to feel and it's all our fault.
who asked for an apology?
dude was simply pointing out that england, and the company they tasked with ruling india, were fucking assholes.
not sure why you're taking it so personally.
&gt; the government only took direct rule in the late 1800's so can you really blame a country for the shit a company has done?
yes, you absolutely can.
&gt; the government only took direct rule in the late 1800's so can you really blame a country for the shit a company has done?
yes, we can, the eic was given permission by the british government to wage war in india.
the deaths they caused were an extension of the british government's foreign and domestic policy as a colonialist imperialist power.
further, the british raj caused the death of 20 million due to famines.
at best you can say that's "not quite as bad" as how fucking horrible the east india company was.
it's still more people killed than 3 holocausts but nobody ever seems to let germany forget about that one do they?
&gt; why should i feel guilty by someone like you when i did nothing wrong?
because all the wealth and prosperity you and your nation enjoy was built on the suffering and poverty of india, and other british colonies.
tell me, how much is 50 million people's lives?
how much is reversing 400 years of devastating economic exploitation?
what reparations your government has made to india are essentially a pittance compared to the damage it did.
huge swaths of india are still incredibly impoverished and illiterate.
&gt; it's been 120 years 60~ since british rule ended.
&gt; you are on the internet telling people around the world how bad they have to feel and it's all our fault.
if we stay silent and say nothing, it's explicitly condoning the continued inheritance of this blood money.
yes, people should feel shame for their ancestor's actions, and seek to make their governments account of their actions.
maybe the people who did the crimes are gone, but their money isn't, and their government's aren't.
britain is still paying debt from a financial crisis 300 years old, its crimes don't just go away either.
because you still have their stuff?
all the treasures that were looted from india ended up in rich peoples houses if not the museum in britain... doesnt the queen still have their goddesses eye or something?
"hurr dur durr yeah nothing to apologize for" *walks past indian exhibit with collection of royal stuff* on the bright side, we made you pretty good at cricket.
i don't hate british people man, i just want people to have an honest reading of history which is something indian people have constantly been denied.
there is so much racism and bigotry on reddit regarding india that it gets hard not to be defensive.
i don't hold british people living there today accountable for what occurred in the past.
'england did nothing to civilise india' except india has a government and bureuracracy heavily influenced by the legacy of british governance.
churchill also used canadian soldiers as cannon fodder at dieppe.
so... anyway, history is an ugly pile of shit, people gotta move on.
canadians and 200+ british commandos, a british destroyer, british airplanes... not to mention that the lessons learned in dieppe were actually incredibly useful in helping organize d day later on i'm really surprised this completely 100% incorrect and wrong comment is top comment here.
til saying brutal unwarranted mass murder of 300-1000 peaceful people is "disgusting" is apologizing?
there was no apology anywhere.
"dyer (man who ordered mass murder) was initially lauded by conservative forces in the empire" "he became a celebrated hero in the uk among most of the people connected to the british raj, by the way churchill starved millions of indians in 1943 (74 years ago)..said "indians are beastly people with beastly religion" "famine is their own fault for breeding like rabbits" when asked about famine and indians dying he said “then why hasn't gandhi died yet?” interesting history of the man who took action to avenge the killings: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/udham_singh *i did it because i had a grudge against him.
he deserved it.
he was the real culprit.
he wanted to crush the spirit of my people, so i have crushed him.
for full 21 years, i have been trying to wreak vengeance.
i am happy that i have done the job.
i am not scared of death.
i am dying for my country.
i have seen my people starving in india under the british rule.
i have protested against this, it was my duty.
what a greater honour could be bestowed on me than death for the sake of my motherland?
* i was just about to post about udham singh, he was such a bad-ass.
for those who don't know, udham singh (who also took up the alias "ram mohammed singh azad") assassinated [michael o'dwyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_o%27dwyer) in london in 1940, who was the lieutenant governor of punjab during the time of the amritsar massacre.
udham singh was himself an orphan boy in amritsar and at the time of the massacre was serving water to protestors.
he subsequently became involved in revolutionary groups like the [ghadar party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ghadar_party) and the [hindustan socialist republican association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hindustan_socialist_republican_association).
he spent five years in prison for helping traffic weapons to indian revolutionaries, and as soon as he was released he made his way to london, and finally avenged amristar by gunning down o'dwyer after a speech at a local club.
his alias is a work of genius.
using names from all the major faiths in india.
what's "azad" ?
pretty sure it's the farsi word for freedom free the most complicated game in the galaxy why doesn't mr khan go and talk to his old buddy tony blair and get him to apologise for misleading the people into an illegal invasion.
jumped up wee twat.
"god told me to do it....and george bush" if he can do that, he should.
blair will never apologize he’s adamant the war was good i'm sure there's some british commandos who can convince him otherwise.
they're good at it.
yes because if people make a statement on one issue they then must act on any other issue that someone on reddit can think of to prove they have moral integrity.
it would help if you expand on 'jumped up wee twat' as that's the more interesting part of your statement.
he's working up to it in chronological order.
it might take a while, given uk's misdeeds, and he's only doing the last 100 years.
btw, stop the whataboutism.
mayor of london thinking he runs the country again.
well may certainly isn't.
you watch, he'll be the labour leader at some point.
i fucking hope not.
i'd quite like corbyn to be pm.
whilst i don't think he'd make the perfect pm, i do think he'll do a better job investing into infrastructure and public services whilst giving big business a little more of a hard time.
i can't imagine sadiq would make any significant changes, just more of kicking the can down the road.
when will muslims apologize to india for the mughal empire?
i for one want those damn italians to apologise for roman empire after boudicca unsuccessfully tried to kick those romans out.
/s no joke though there was a celtic holocaust.
dan carlin has a good podcast on it: http://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-60-the-celtic-holocaust/ i will never apologize it was our roman right.
grr!
when will uzbekistan apologize for timur's massacre in delhi?
it was 600 years ago but more than 100000 were executed.
timur has a statue in tashkent.
i am afraid that there are no more states that are the direct descendant of the mughal or the timurid empire pakistan, afghanistan, and bangladesh are all descended from the colonies of timur and the mughal empire.
as well as india then (140m muslims) those mongolo-turks should apologize to ottomans too.
[because of timurid empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_ankara) many records of the ottomans were destroyed and thus we don't know the exact year when ottoman principality was found.
[timur captured the ottoman emperor bayezid](http://www.burnpit.us/2012/07/part-ii-battle-angora).
timur killed millions of people on his way.
you do realize that india gained its independence only about 70 years ago?
there are still people alive who grew up under colonialist rule.
how is that relevant to the current topic?
if there is a country that's called the "mughal empire" then i'd ask them to apologise as well.
but there is no such country.
or for slavery perpetuated well into the 1900s: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_slavery_in_the_muslim_world#19th_and_20th_centuries i hate to be the one to tell you this... but slavery is alive and well all over the world, regardless of religion https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/contemporary_slavery well into the modern era: see qatar.
and mauritania https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_events_named_massacres when are the indians going to apologize?
everyone has something to apologize for, but only western nations are expected to do so.
doesn't the western world hold itself up as 'enlightened' and modern?
isn't this what you'd then expect from western nations?
anyone curious can watch the reenactment of that massacre in gandhi movie.
sad and shameful event [deleted] apologizing would means that bg recognizes publicly that it has done wrong.
if bg publicly recognizes that it has done wrong, it can be argued formally that bg should pay compensation (that is to carried by todays and tomorrows british tax payers).
wait... you think it was okay to massacre hundreds of innocent and above all non-violent people?
i don't think anyone is defending it, just saying that it's unreasonable to think that people who never endured anything are owed money by people who never did anything.
[removed] the idea is reconciliation: putting old angers to rest.
i support the move and it would be a classy approach for the uk government to embrace an apology.
it doesn't cost anything but a bit of national pride and would assure britons of indian descent that england is putting faith in their citizens.
there's no good reason they shouldn't pursue this option.
&gt;and would assure britons of indian descent that england is putting faith in their citizens.
this is a nebulous connection you have made.
same reason as apologies were made to alan turing, or about the treatment of lgbt or in australia?
aboriginals.
it's acceptance of a tragedy and gross injustice.
it costs nothing and gains goodwill from a cynical standpoint.
it buries a hatchet and makes moving forward easier from an optimistic one.
so why do people demand turkey apologize for the armenian genocide, which occurred even earlier and not even by turkey?
i think in that specific case it isn't so much as getting an apology but getting them to recognize that it actually happened.
the government is not new.
it can apologize.
the government is new, but the state isn't.
the hell?
it changes through elections.
an apology isn't about attempting to change history.
he said it at a memorial event... what else is he supposed to say?
sometimes i feel like people are overly critical of khan for some strange reason &gt; what else is he supposed to say?
the same thing cameron said: &gt; david cameron was the first british prime minister to visit a memorial for the amritsar massacre in the northern state of punjab in february 2013.
&gt; he described the massacre by troops under british command as "deeply shameful", but stopped short of an apology.
what's wrong with an apology?
last week a redditor stole money from me.
as a you are redditor, i feel you owe me an apology.
did reddit sanction that action?
this is so disengenous and stupid.
it's not a request for some bloke from leeds to apologize, the request is for the government to apologize.
a bloke from leeds has about as much to do with the people responsible as the current government.
the current government is representing the state.
the bloke from leeds is not.
yeah, condemning the actions is appropriate.
apologising is not.
i don't know, that bloke from leeds is a right cunt, and shady.
why would the government apologise for something that happened when none of them currently in power were born?
for the same reason people keep demanding turkey to apologise for what the ottoman empire did.
i think it’s more so that turkey doesn’t even recognize that it happened.
you're right, the british government of 90 years ago is totally unrelated to the british government of today.
no relationship whatsoever.
no shared responsibility.
how can someone be responsible for something that happened before they were born?
as it was said, an apology was given by churchill so what this is saying is every successive government should apologize every 4 years for what happened.
like seriously wtf, it's just bullshit and used as a political tool to undermine the competition.
that was wrong.
there should be an apology.
unless we're the evil bad guys.
churchill apologized.
some strange reason = he's muslim and/or liberal or he's just a fucking idiot he's not white.

[removed] your takeing that quote of context.
is that statement false?
over the last several decades, terrorist attacks have occurred regularly in big cities; preparing for and expecting a terrorist attack is the reality of living in a large, western city.
he said londoners should expect to see a heavy presence of law enforcement over the next few days (following an attack), and that because terrorist attacks happen in major cities, they must be prepared and vigilant to prevent them.
what an asshole for saying that, right?
making people who weren't even alive when something happened apologize for it is an application of collective guilt.
collectively judging a group of people based on their ethnicity is bigotry.
let's have an apology for ireland too come out ye black and tans i hope this happens.
colonialism and erasure go hand in hand edit: itt "yeah but this one dude was irish" the liuetenant governor of the punjab at the time of amritsar was an irishman.
he ended up getting assassinated for it.
people on here constantly ask turkey to apologise for the armenian genocide, which was perpetuated by the ottomans, but as soon as someone ask a european country to apologise for their past atrocities, all of a sudden it's "*but the current government has nothing to do with the past.
*" classic reddit.
same with reddit and japan’s government regarding comfort women.
i wonder why, lol.
you think britain will return the stolen indian jewels and artifacts sitting in its museums right now?
yep.
the fact that people don't see their own double standard is ridiculous.
turkey and japan flat out denie these things happened.
you won't find a respected member or british society who denies these past atrocities.
david cameron went to pay respect at the memorial and said it was a "deeply shameful" and "monstrous event" , this is completely incomparable to japans or turkeys stance on their historic atrocities.
pretty sure most aren't wanting turkey to pointlessly apologize, they want turkey to recognize it happened.
pretty major difference, nobody in england is denying this piece of history happened.
it's not the expectation that turkey should apologise, rather that it should cease denial of the genocide.
the british acknowledge it happened and that it was wrong, stopping short of a formal apology.
why?
what will britain actually lose from an apology?
"it is policy not to apologize guys."
as the top comment says, policy.
move on.
c**ts.
only if we can get france to apologise for the hundred years war yes because killing in war and colonial massacres are the exact same thing.
then again, belgium has never apologized for what they did in africa, and that was arguably worse.
belgium should be ashamed of not apologizing for leopold.
that's one of the darkest and most naked examples of european colonialism.
well theres that whole swiss banks and nazi gold thing too.. europeans don't seem to like to apologize for the past even if it costs them nothing, unlike the victims of any of the events they were involved in.
switzerland accepting that they *still have and are profiting from* stolen wealth would absolutely cost them billions at the end of the day it's still money gold and women right.
what gives the right to one man to rule over the other.
&gt; no one don't seem to like to apologize for the past even if it costs them nothing corrected.
there is no nation on earth be it africa, asia etc.
that likes to play with their closet full of skeletons.
apologizing for past mistakes is also something that only western world does.
you never see someone trying to have muslims apologize for slave trade but it is always us or europeans who were the first to drop slave trade completely way before anyone else.
have the zulus ever apologised for the atrocities committed by chaka?
what about the bantus, have they apologised for their slaving empire?
don't get me wrong, i absolutely think former colonial powers should apologise for their horrific behaviour in the past.
i just think that *all* former and current colonial powers should apologise, it seems clear to me that when someone who claims to be "post colonialist" or "anti imperialist" and only is exclusively interested in criticising *one single* imperial power, then i suspect they aren't motivated by a desire for justice and fairness, and are more probably motivated by racial animus.
the muslims still haven't apologised for the slave trade yet either or given reparations despite their oil wealth.
&gt; yes because killing in war and colonial massacres are the exact same thing well, we can get the norwegians to apologise for the viking invasions then.
they were pretty brutal and included plenty of rape and murder of civilians.
sorry!
i'm an ignorant american but shouldn't that be britain apologizing to france?
i thought you guys were the aggressors?
it's not our fault they had spent thousands of years living on our land... you're right, but in my experience the british people have very limited respect for historical accuracy; they value national pride well above truth.
this is what we're seeing all over this rather unfortunate thread (for instance, see the ridiculous top comment...).
who exactly would they be apologizing to ?
everyone affected by it are long dead.
fuck off sadiq history is history.
apologizing for it does nothing but waste hot air.
learn from it and never do it again.
&gt; learn from it and never do it again.
refusing to apoloogize is a clear sign you haven't learnt from it.
this whole business about "dur it's history shut up ur just virtue signaling" is stupid.
just admit the people fucked up and that the actions of the nation have had affects that are still impacting the victims descendants.
like, seriously.
all people have to do is apologize.
instead they cry about how terrible everyone else is for talking about the fucked up things that happened.
it's ironic, it's almost like political correctness to insist you shouldn't talk about the bad things from the past because it offends you.
why are people in this thread so mad about this?
i can understand differences of opinion regarding the issuing of an apology, but why slag off sadiq for voicing an opinion?
an opinion held (and expressed) by many others?
if we apologized once then why should our government apologize every time we get a new pm?
it's fucking pointless at that point, saying sorry all the time loses meaning.
but the uk didn't apologize.
churchill didn't and no pm has since.
there are certain people who get angry about everything sadiq khan does or says, because he's a muslim.
that's the great thing about being a muslim, no one can disagree with you or they are simply racist and don't like muslims.
i can name a lot of muslims i don't disagree with.
for example, i think anjem choudary is a piece of shit.
so why don't you tell me why so many us conservatives hate sadiq khan, whereas they don't give a shit about any other mayors of foreign cities?
because he dared to call out their precious, low-iq, thin-skinned, rapist president.
oh, and because he's a muslim.
did you even think about what the fuck you just wrote?
yea, let me try to dumb it down a bit.
1. nobody thinks a person is racist simply because they disagree with a muslim on something.
for example, i think anjem choudary (a british muslim) is a piece of shit for his religious views, yet nobody would label me a racist for that.
2. if they don't have a problem with him being muslim, why do so many us conservatives hate sadiq khan?
because he is known?
if people knew who anjem choudary was maybe they would dislike him too?
when has anyone (especially in the us) ever known who the mayor of london was before 2016?
never.
khan takes every opportunity he gets to pretend hes the leader of the nation when really his position is largely symbolic the more i learn it seems like they should "apologize" for many, many things.
it's disturbing how much chaos and misery can be traced back to britain.
https://youtu.be/fqmh3wshi4q?list=pl1a798cf37cb313d3 to those saying that the people who did this are dead.
it isn't the people of uk that have to apologize, it's the state of uk which is responsible for the acts and which was and still is in existence.
international responsibility for an act does not fade with time.
as long as the uk exists, it will be responsible for the jallianwala bagh massacre under international law.
under the articles of state responsibility, acknowledgement and apology is a valid form of restitution for an internationally wrongful act.
#why is this so important?
because there are a huge number of britons who believe that colonisation was good, who make arguments like 'but we developed your railways' as if you **need** to be colonised to have a railway system.
this needs to happen because there are so many people in the uk that don't believe the uk did anything wrong, it needs to be acknowledged and regretted.
it's downright hurtful to hear britons justifying the genocide of your people.
[on the railway system and other "benefits" of british colonialism in india](https://youtu.be/f7cw7s0zxv4).
india was ultimately left much worse off and people who like to recount colonial "favors" upon former colonies should be embarrassed to be that ignorant.
mate, shashi tharoor is hardly an impartial source nearly every statement he made was supported by numbers (the lack of which you will notice on the opposition's side if you watch the whole debate).
unless you believe the figures he presented are erroneous, i'm not certain what the issue is.
that’s the thing, he throws a couple of numbers at you and, although factually correct, they lack an enormous amount of context.
which is entirely intentional.
it’s not that tharoor lies, it’s that he presents the data so selectively it’s difficult to argue that he’s making a honest argument.
take the first fact he mentions in that video as example: he states that at the outset of the colonial period, india’s share of global gdp was 24% but that this had shrunk to 4% over the subsequent 200 years.
that’s not wrong, those figures are correct (in as much as we can accurately estimate these things).
what he neglects to mention is that india’s share of global gdp had been falling for centuries, long before any european ever set foot on the subcontinent.
in the classical era, this figure was as high as 40%, and there was a protracted decline over several hundred years.
it’s entirely plausible that it would have continued to decline even if there had been no colonial period, although certainly not at the same rate.
what also compounds this is that very soon after india was colonised, the industrial revolution kicked off, which lead to absolutely meteoric growth in the gdps of several european countries.
there were many technological innovation which simply made these societies so much more productive and efficient, and, importantly, this accelerated growth began before widespread exploitation of colonial reproduces and labour.
now, the pillaging of india by the british empire certainly contributed to their economic decline, and i won’t start an argument about the empire being good for india, but the point is that without any sort of context, some of the effects of imperialism are at least a little exaggerated.
your information about india's economy at the time doesn't seem to be accurate.
&gt;india experienced gdp growth in the late medieval era after 1000, during the delhi sultanate, but was overtaken by ming china as the largest economy by 1500.
**after most of the subcontinent was reunited under the mughal empire, india again became the largest economy by 1700, producing about a quarter of global gdp, before declining under british rule in the late 18th century.
** &gt;according to the balance of economic power, india had the largest and most advanced economy for most of the interval between the 1st century and 18th century, the most of any country for a large part of the last two millennia.
&gt;during the mughal empire, india was the world leader in manufacturing, producing 25% of the world's industrial output up until the mid-18th century, prior to british rule.
... &gt;by 1700, mughal india had become the world's largest economy, ahead of qing china and western europe, producing about a quarter of world output.
[29] mughal india produced about 25% of global industrial output into the early 18th century.
[4] **india's gdp growth increased under the mughal empire, exceeding growth in the prior 1,500 years.
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economic_history_of_india none of that disputes what i said, those are figures about the size of indian economy, not the share of global gdp.
they are quite different.
it's possible for to become the largest economy in the world whilst experiencing a decline in your share of the global economy.
from the comments you just quoted, [this](http://www.pdviz.com/tag/gdp) is one of the sources and it illustrates my point.
for clarity, i'm talking about the *balance of economic power 1ad - 2009* chart a little ways down.
what is clear from this is that china and india were, for much of the last 2000 years, by far the biggest players.
what else is clear is that, before the modern era, you can see india's share waxing and waning inversely with chinas.
for example, if china goes through a rough patch and their economy suffers, it will look like india is having a boom time (regardless of the economic reality on the ground).
everything is relative - that's why tharoor shouldn't use such measures to argue his point.
what else is clear from the chart, is that india's share was consistently declining from ad1000 until ad1600.
so, i get that the information isn't complete or ideal, that chart has it's limitation in terms of what you can conclude from it, but i don't really see how the wiki counters what i said?
canada has apologized for past mistakes with the clear intention of not wanting to make similar mistakes in the future.
we've got a pretty good list going: 1988: then-prime minister brian mulroney apologizes in the house of commons for the internment of japanese-canadians during the second world war.
2001: ron duhamel, then the minister of veterans affairs, apologizes in the house of commons for the executions of 23 canadian soldiers during the first world war and says their names will be added to the country’s book of remembrance.
2006: then-prime minister stephen harper apologizes in the house of commons for the head tax imposed on chinese immigrants between 1885 and 1923.
2008: harper apologizes in the house of commons for canada’s residential schools system, which more than 150,000 first nations, metis and inuit children attended from the 1840s to 1996.
2016: prime minister justin trudeau apologizes in the house of commons for the komagata maru incident, in which a shipload of immigrants from india was turned away from vancouver in 1914.
2017: prime minister justin trudeau apologizes for past state-sanctioned discrimination against lgbtq people.
they should tell him to fuck himself.
why should the current government apologize for the actions of another?
it's a waste of time not to mention insincere.
i would hate to have someone who was genuinely upset about this running anything at any level of government.
it's quite mad.
what's your view on the japanese government's refusal to acknowledge things like comfort women and unit 731?
acknowledgement of a fact and apologizing for it are two different things.
the japanese(official government anyways) flat out refuses that it happened.
i would not expect them to apologize if they did acknowledge it as many if not all of the perps are no longer working for the government.
i might as well apologize for my great uncle bring a deserter in the war before i was born, that's about how much sense this makes.
its the uk government apologising, not the person of the prime minister.
he has a point i suppose.
if the effects of english colonialism can still be felt strongly today where i live- new zealand- then those effects are undoubtedly more damaging in countries like india.
that the english refuse to acknowledge that they were one of the most brutal empires in history, and that people today are still in fact suffering from it, is a fucking farce.
[the massacre as portrayed in ghandi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fys2lvv7vea&amp;feature=share) what a load.
people shouldn't apologize for things that weren't their responsibility.
those officials, citizens, victims are all dead and buried deep.
this is just digging up someone's grave for something new to throw at their feet in an effort to shame them.
wondered why there was so much hate for sadiq, then i saw we were in r/worldnews.
[removed] [removed] [he did.

&gt;visiting the jallianwala bagh memorial and garden on wednesday as part of a 6-day trade mission to india and pakistan, that's a bit above his post cool, i didn't know, thanks for linking!
yeah sadiq, how many hindus did those pesky moghuls kill huh?
this should be a nice thread ah....this sub's daily anti-muslim circle jerk...thinly masqueraded as usual.
i'm indian, this would be like white people now apologizing to black people for keeping them as slaves.
the people who kept them as slaves aren't alive.. so why should their descendants apologize?
tbh i keep hearing this shit about apologising for the past, history and other troubles times.
no apology is needed, people as a society i like to think we move forward in knowing right and wrong.
the other day i hear a school wanted to be renamed because it was named after a slave trader, look this shit happened, stop trying to hide, cover up, apologise for things we've learnt are wrong and not good periods in our history.
the english empire ruled a large proportion of world that probably wasn't a good thing in hindsight but it is what it is.
i'm not sure how renaming the school would be the same as hiding it?
you're not removing it from history books, or preventing museums from discussing it.
by naming things like schools after them it seems uncomfortably close to glorifying them, not remembering them as terrible people.
it would seem the mayor of london is looking more for the people of india than for the people of london.
oh yes that apology is gonna help the people of india so much and of course, the people of london will suffer from it the people of london don't seem to have a problem with anything he's saying, but i'm sure they appreciate your concern.
instead of sadiq seeking a apology from the uk for something that's not in anyway, recent history.
india (and sadiq perhaps) should be seeking an apology from the man who invented plastic.
he has arguably fucked up india in such a way it will be a problem for longer then the british empire even existed.
the british empire did terrible things, but so did every other kingdom with a colony.
shit like this just erodes away at our current relationship with others while doing nothing to actually benefit either party.

welcome to the 19th century, saudi arabia!
only 200+ years until they legalize gay marriage!
how's that death penalty doing over there, america?
that was a zinger if i've ever seen one.
how's those [blasphemy laws](https://ipi.media/despite-danish-repeal-blasphemy-laws-still-common-in-europe/) doing over there, europe?
[blasphemy laws exist in the us too.
](http://centreforinquiry.ca/blasphemy-laws-still-exist-in-the-united-states/) have another try those laws aren't national, only exsist in six states, and don't hold up in court.
even in the states that have them, they are a relic of a different time and they aren't enforced.
the only mention of blasphemy laws they could find was about "i choose hell" productions.
that guy sued the state of pennsylvania over the law and was awarded the company name anyway.
[here](https://www.paed.uscourts.gov/documents/opinions/10d0634p.pdf) are the court documents, you don't have to take my word for it or do your own research.
check mate yeah... no one enforces those.
as a european i am free to say that i think all religion is gobbledygook.
christianity, islam, judaism, buddhism, hinduism and all the others, a whole crock of shit and if you follow any of them i think you are an idiot (not trying to be edgy here boys just proving a point).
i am free to say that wherever and whenever i want to, one thing i am not allowed to do is put 20 people to death in 2016 alone.
are you allowed to allege that less than 6 million jews died in ww2?
or are you allowed to boycott israel(the country), without having the government shut your concert down.
in germany(most powerful country, and "leader of the eu"), and many places inside the eu, the answer is no.
it shouldn't be against the law to believe that a god alien from the sky, named xenu, or yahweh, is coming back to save/destory the earth, and that your superior race will be saved( scientologists, jews believe this).
just like it shouldn't be illegal to say that 5.5 million jews died in ww2 at hitler's hand, instead of 6. if we're talking about the likelihood of one being correct... it's hard to argue that the god alien stories are very scientifically probable.
but, this isn't about probability, or plausibility, or anything like that.
it's about freedom of speech.
and freedom of speech works by allowing all ideas to be spoken, no matter how many god aliens, or ufos, or nonsensical historical revisions are in them.
the problem with unlimited freedom of speech is that there are always going to be people who are going to be abusing it, see fake news, for example.
now, after the nazi regime, germany obviously didn't want it to be repeated.
there was a concrete danger that in the future people could downplay it, justify the actions and reinstate something like that again.
so they made it illegal to deny the holocaust.
is it a free speech violation?
yes.
does it matter for non-nazis?
no.
so i don't care.
note that this is the only limitation of free speech i'm aware of (and i am german).
you still have free speech.
(and the concert thing doesn't fall under free speech) &gt;does it matter for non-nazis?
no.
well, it matters to any decent, unbiased historian, or scientist.
for instance, the iraq war that started in 2003, the figures for deaths, and casualties vary by hundreds of %'s.
this is with satellites, and modern organizations actively trying to count the casualties.
the idea that somehow back in ww2, they know exactly how many jews die is insane.
we can't say with any degree of certainty how many people died in iraq/syria.
yet, we're somehow supposed to believe that we know exactly 6 million jews died, over 1/2 a century ago?
that's not to mention that the nazis burnt most of their paperwork, and tried to cover it up the best they could.
an example of why one shouldn'tt use this authoritarian history, is the katyn massacre (20k deaths).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katyn_massacre from 1945-1990, it was believed by the whole world that the massacre was done by the nazis.
but, when the soviet union was about to fall, they admitted they had lied for 40+ years, and they had really done it, not the nazis.
for 40+ years, the whole world blamed the nazis, when in fact it was the soviets.
speaking of something like this was illegal in germany at the time... yet it was the truth.
well, there's a few thousand people that they thought were killed by the nazis, that weren't.
why isn't that reflected in the numbers.
6 million - any number doesn't = 6 million.
so, if you have a problem with illogical history, and are scientific in thought, or just have a thing for doing basic math correctly, then you have a problem with just saying 6 million people died, regardless of the evidence.
i'm not overly familiar with any other theories than hitler killing 6 million jews, but i would say that if someone killed let's say, 5.5 million people who lived lives as full and as real as mine and yours, with hopes, dreams, regrets and fears it doesn't exactly clear their name much by reducing that number by 1/12 so i fail to see the whole idea behind it, but i agree if you have sufficient data to prove that then it should be your right to challenge it regardless of my opinion of the subject.
with the boycotting israel in germany that is a bit more of a touchy subject, i doubt i need to explain why but anything that can be taken as anti-semitic in germany is seen in very bad taste because that kind ideology is from undoubtably their darkest time in history.
where i live as far i'm concerned i can be openly critical of israel (a fair number of people are) and their actions as we don't think that israel is the representative of the entirety of judaism, hell you wouldn't believe the variation of demonstrations i've seen in the town centre, i would not at all be surprised if one of them has been about israels action with palestine.
i know they charged a danish guy with it last year.
the first person since the 40's.
i dunno what the outcome was though.
at least we don't execute atheists.
stop whataboutisming reddit will take every opportunity to shit on america lol.
america will take every opportunity to shit on itself, you need no help from reddit.
right?
where the hell did this even come from?
pretty good, ireland.
getting rid of it in 1990 really makes you feel superior eh?
it should make him feel superior.
the us has not yet arrived at where ireland was in 1954.
&gt; capital punishment in ireland was prohibited in statute law in 1990, having been abolished in 1964 for most offences including ordinary murder.
**the last to be executed was michael manning, hanged for murder in 1954.
** subsequent death sentences, the last handed down in 1985, were commuted by the president, on the advice of the government, to terms of imprisonment of up to 40 years.
a constitutional amendment passed by referendum in 2001 prohibits reintroduction of the death penalty, even during a state of emergency or war.
i live in michigan, which banned it in 1846. can i at least feel superior to my neighboring americans?
detroit fuck just because they didn't use it, doesn't mean they couldn't.
&gt; subsequent death sentences, the last handed down in 1985 because they sure tried.
come back to me when the us just tries.
well, in order to do it you have to try to do it.
you don't accidentally order and commit capital punishment.
&gt; michael manning sucks to be him.
if he had only waited ten more years to be a murderer he might have been good to go!
there were something like 20 people executed in the us last year in a country of 300 million so like 1 hundred thousandth of a percent.
saudi arabia is only about 30 million and executed 150. the percentage of gay people in any given group is estimated to be 1% to as high as 20%.
you're issue is orders of magnitude lower than executions in saudi arabia and many more orders of magnitude lower than suppression of gay rights in saudi arabia.
saudi arabia executes alot more people than we do.
and they execute people for being gay too.
this isn't a competition, fellow human.
so far so good for me anyways death penalty not legal in every state unfortunately.
everyone knows we only keep it around for its comedic value.
what’s wrong with death penalty?
killing people is bad.
if you slaughter a family of innocent people i’m ok with death penalty.
why waste hundreds of thousands of dollars on prison.
pretty good thanks, you know we kill those who commit horrible vicious crimes and can't be rehabilitated into the society.
how's that high horse of the yours?
yeah, we've never done tests exonerating lots of executed inmates, no sir, we always get the right guy.
yep....every time........ the death penalty isn't the issue.
it's the cops and judges who aren't doing their jobs properly the 1st go around.
it's not like we have a prison system that exploits its prisoners along with massive overpopulation.
you're right it's better to keep them alive even if they brutally murder and raped a little girl.
if we keep him alive we can use him as slave labor and make some prisons some money instead of wasting the money on the killing him.
maybe he'll kill some other people in jail as well, just locked him out up in solitary for the rest if his life while we feed him.
there are way too many cases where the wrong person dies to justify even a single case where a rapist is killed.
innocent blood is not worth criminals getting a "just" punishment.
it's just not a worthwhile issue.
it costs more to execute someone if you include the dozens of appeals that move up through courts and the defendants get state attorneys paid for by the tax dollars.
our prison systems are privatized in a way to encourage no rehabilitation and try and maintain as many inmates as possible.
our system is broken and death penalties in a broken and corrupt system is needlessly putting innocent people at risk.
it has nothing to do with the criminals who may or may not genuinely deserve death.
we can never guarantee guilt, fingerprints, dna, confessions and witnesses are all imprecise fields that can also easily be tampered with.
death penalty is best penalty best korea agrees praise kim jong un!
but no one will take advantage of it because they killed all gay people.
how long ago did the us legalize it?
it's not legal in a big chunk of the eu, mexico, or a large portion of south america, none of the middle east, only south africa in africa, and pretty much none of asia.
but, no, let's criticize a country that already legalized gay marriage, out of all of the hundreds of countries out there where it's still illegal.
makes a lot of sense.
also, pretty sure /u/raflflopper2 was just making a joke about how long it takes the saudis to do anything progressive at all.
how progressive of them!
and yet they're arguably still moving too fast, if mbs goes overboard with the reforms we could see a major backlash from the right wing, which could wipe out years of progress.
aside from the jibes here i'm glad sa is moving in the right direction.
news like this are good in a time where so much is going wrong any progress is progress yeah but it was a cover of slave 4 u by britney spears yet they give citizenship to a robot.
i don't see a robot hosting it's first concert yet though the robot won't be hosting much of anything... as they beheaded it.
ha, jokes on u, the head of the robot is actually his penis [does robotic music count?
](https://twitter.com/hossamovitch_/status/911695169187139586) it means robots have rights.
women are just for entertainment.
but doesn't mean they allowed to drive....yet.
redditors: "saudi arabia is the most backward country ever!
they need reforms!"
(ksa begins to make small, incremental changes in a positive direction) redditors: "lol, this famously conservative country didn't snap it's fingers and transform itself into a tolerant nation with perfect gender equality in 5 nanoseconds.
what a farce!"
reminds me of this "friend" i had who would complain whenever he had less shit to complain about.
yeah, this level of insatiability is a common staple here, isn't it?
i would applaud these changes if their current leader who spearheaded the reform wasn't also a war criminal who is right now starving the children of yemen by creating the worst man-made famine since mao, while at the same time being applauded by trump, fox news and such this is our steadfast ally folks...let that sink in for a bit.... the us still literally executes that people for certain crimes, let that sink in too.
you're really trying to push that in this thread, huh?
ya i'm not exactly against killing rapists and child murderers... problem is when innocent people get put to death because corrupt cops and prosecutors just want a result.
true, there's a fine line.
i would hope it's only done in scenarios where proven 100% with no doubt whatsoever and for the most heinous of crimes.
if there is a shred of doubt then i would not advocate for the death penalty because of that very reason.
with you 100% in that case it's cheaper to incarcerate someone for life than to execute them (due to the exceedingly high costs of the legal process, appeals, all that shit).
should of kept your karma with the first comment.
now you just gettin greeduhhh to be fair they use to be more progressive.

&gt;a woman for the first time is performing at a concert in saudi arabia.
no, they didn't used to be more progressive.
maybe you're thinking of a different country in the middle east?
iran, he's thinking of iran.
iran or maybe afghanistan.
saudi arabia has always been a shithole.
but women still have to wear ninjas outfits in like 50°c weather.
ninjas arent supposed to get so sweaty how sweaty are ninjas supposed to get?
not at all.
theyre supposed to stay cool, sweat alot can lead to them leaving dna behind i hate saudi arabia with passion (government) but this a good move and don’t understand why people are being so cynical and negative.
progress happens slowly because people think their own countries were born perfect and one day came about and said "everything will be free and perfect, woo" and as such their perfect western society standards were met, with no bloodshed, no conflict, and definitely no slavery, discrimination and other sorts of segregation.
something about bombing civilians in yemen and starving them out.
i know that’s why hate them besides supporting terrorist groups "singer dies at unofficial public stoning" saudis are actually very much party animals.
they travel to bahrain and dubai by the masses every weekend to have any form of entertainment.
&gt; ***ultra wealthy*** saudis are actually very much party animals.
they travel to bahrain and dubai by the masses every weekend to have any form of entertainment.
ftfy different set of rules for different classes.
actually you dont need to be ultra wealthy or even wealthy to travel to dubai or bahrain on the weekend... they're both next door and relatively no, traveling to bahrain is cheap as dirt.
just a 30 minute drive, no visa nor payment.
my friend goes from kuwait to bahrain with only 300 dollars on him.
if that is ultra wealthy than i do not wanna visit where you live.
[removed] "sexual abuse", is that what you call consensual prostitution?
buying them as slaves doesn't make it consensual.
slaves?
this is dubai, not usa are you a time traveller?
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/25/us/raid-sex-trafficking-thailand.html sex slavery in usa is pretty common http://thefreethoughtproject.com/saudi-arabia-complicit-sex-trafficking-ring/ doesn't compare.
dude, saudi arabia and dubai are entirely different countries.
how ignorant can you be :d on this year's saudi national day they had a dj for the public event in riyadh, [people went apeshit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2cx_wsf9ky) saudi here.
until 2015, i never thought we will have such things before 2025. it's quite crazy.
public executions and at the same time they have [events like this](https://twitter.com/hossamovitch_/status/911695169187139586).
i really can't comprehend saudi arabia.
events like that must be super lame without any pretty ladies to dance with... biggest sausage fest in the planet.
geez no wonder why these guys are so frustrated.
man people were talking mad shit when saudi arabia was appointed to lead that un womens' group, but since then they've liberalized a shit ton relative to where they were.
y'all people need some perspective man, we have to bring people in not ice them out.
to celebrate this historic occasion, they held a public stoning for the musician and beheaded 20 gays.
and her head isn’t wrapped.
so much winning.
she's lebanese.
do people realize this is an all-female concert?
no men are allowed.
i don't understand why they even prohibited that, since it's not against islam.
this doesn't even count as progress.
gender-segregation.
what has changed that saudi's are starting to come around?
the new crown prince who has arrested a lot of the corrupt royal family and religious leaders in the country is looking to modernize and diversify saudi arabia's economy and workforce.
he wants to diversify from oil and is planning to open a new manufacturing/tourist/business city similar to dubai by 2030. he's slowly introducing things such as allowing women to drive, increasing women engagement in the workforce, as well as appealing to the younger demographic.
it'll be a tough challenge since there will be backlash from the conservative side, but he's appealing to the younger progressive demographic hoping to be on the side of public opinion.
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/24/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-back-moderate-islam/ wait this guy sounds baller... is he enough to do it single handily, wonder how strong the push back will be ive been coming and going to saudi for 8 years.. and am in saudi now.
it is time... the people here have internet.
they know how the world is and they want to have it.
cool story about the arrests: the prince erected the bureau in the morning... and in the afternoon all those guys where arrested.
imagine being arrested by a bureau that you never heard off lol it comes with positives and negatives.
progressive domestically maybe, but very hawkish towards iran and a proponent of saudi military actions in the middle east.
&gt; is he enough to do it single handily no, but the good news is that he's not in it alone.
he has plenty of support right now and people aren't real eager to go to prison because they didn't fall in line with his 'progressive' ideals.
his "corruption bashing" could very much be a trimming of the family tree to ensure that nothing wrong happens to him.
gosh, do you even medieval monarchy?
well saudi arabia is a monarchy so if any change were to happen this would by how, from the top-up.
but why is he ensuring "nothing" happens to him?
it's because his plan is to modernize and diversify saudi arabia and those against him in the monarchy would get in the way of that.
in order to do that they must sell 5% of aramco stock, the saudi oil company, as well as gradually bring society up to terms with the 1st world, which many of the wahhabis and conservatives are against.
he could keep things the same and as status quo but if saudi arabia wants to exist in the long-run they must diversify their economy and modernize their society.
this is a big risk he's taking especially because of oil prices and the proxy war they're engaged in with iran in yemen.
they're taking alot on their plate meaning a higher chance of failure.
also appealing to the public and international community is another tactic whether genuine or not, that he could be using to lower the backlash against him.
all in all, saudi arabia is changing and for the better and only time will tell if it's successful.
crown prince.
moving away from oil means they're going to need a productive workforce, so now they let ladies do stuff.
ladies have been working in saudi for a while now true, but only a very small percentage.
wow, so progressive~ i believe big change is coming with the new saudi prince for all th poor women out there last song in that vid sounds really nice the new crown prince is a chill dude.
bombing the shit out of yemen is not very chill.
i thought there were private concerts in the past?
will women be permitted to addend with out the permission of or being in the company of a senior male of the family?
guardian permission is required in traveling abroad, and marriage, claims beyond that are mostly made up.
the female performer turned out to be a robot.
hiba tawaji is actually wonderful artist; here's her version of "windmills of your mind."
or as her title of song suggest "no beginning and no ending" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xbwejfwcdk was it sofia the robit never thought i would see this day in my lifetime.
wow, good for saudi arabia!
moving up in the world, first driving cars, now singing in public for an audience!
who knows maybe after they give women the right to vote they might consider getting rid of slavery and human trafficking.
or just do what the usa did and figure out the whole, welfare state/minimum wage, paradigm.
i wonder how many rocks people tried to throw stones... i mean, it just took them this long to let a female on a stage... good job on a step in the right direction, saudi arabia!
sad that this is in 2017. what could go wrong?
nothing went wrong the concert was perfect :) pleasantly surprised cat is pleasantly surprised!
arrested a male star for dabbing on stage.
nek minnit... these guys, such visionaries!
what next, twerking on saudi tv?
yawn... bfd.
for them, it is.
you seem like the sort of person who’d buy a ticket to a football match just to tell the people there how pointless sports are.
wow?
...and then promptly arrests her.
can iran take over this country now ??
... then she got the rape because she showed her ankle?
now we can focus on the important things like those bloody crocodiles!
every three months they reckon!
strewth.
katter was one of four mps that voted against it, so power to the crocs!
really?
what about not minding anyone’s sexual proclivities??
cunt.
i think he voted in line with the results of his electorate, not necessarily how he feels.
unlike that piece of shit cunt abbott.
aussie-crocodile love is still love, too!
will you, bruce, take bruce as your lawfully wedded husband?
yes, i didgeridoo, m8 i've never regretted a single moment of my wedding day up until i read the words "yes, i didgeridoo, m8".

i feel like i just visited australia.
and sheila can take sheila!
i thought sheila wanted waltzing matilda?
waltzing is something sheila does to matilda, it's not a descriptor, and if i have to explain it to ya, you're too young.
how long were you waiting to crack this joke ?
from a fellow aussie it's a line from a gay porno.
wasnt the title: roses are red, my favourite instrument is brass and then a gif saying: „i will digeridoo you in the ass“ what a shocking outcome, i'm glad we had a large and expensive poll beforehand could be worse... you coulda spent all the money nz did on a flag referendum no one wanted just to decide to keep the same flag they had anyway!
oh man, i was following that on the hello internet podcast.
what a shitshow.
the one flag that people *genuinely wanted*, based on the local sports team, didn't make it into the finals that got actually voted on.
and then the winner of *that* vote went up against the original flag in another vote.
why the fuck did they do it like that?
basically because it was john keys vanity project.
there’s a reason there were two nearly identical choices (only the colour differed) by the same artist on the final vote, and they just happened to be keys favourite 🙄 if the silver fern on black had been an end choice it would have won in a landslide.
long live the dead and buried red peak flag ahhh, i hadn't heard that wrinkle.
i knew about the two variants that almost looked the same, but not why such an odd pair both ended up in the finals.
honestly, no one knows.
literally no one cared.
occasionally they would have, on the news, interviews with the public asking about it and everyone just said, "i don't care, it's not a big deal."
you could tell they had to ask a bunch of leading questions to get any sort of comment, usually accompanied by pictures of the flags because most people didn't even know what the options were until super late.
it would have been hilarious if it wasn't for the $26 million dollar price tag.
(though, there were a bunch of hilarious submissions that were shared around at the time - this is my favourite: http://images.gawker.com/1253528587381531237/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800.jpg) pretty sure that one ended up on r/place.
from the uk: don’t bash your government for overprepreration, appreciate their semblance of adequacy.
… while you can, muahahahaha well it's not like anyone really walked into 2017 thinking that we would have ssm legalised by the end of the year.
i'm of two minds about it.
if they'd pushed forward with it, we'd still get the no campaign happening, but now they'd be able to continue forever, pretending they're the silent majority all along.
now they can't do that.
now same-sex couples and non-hetero individuals know that the majority of the country supports them.
and then on a smaller, but still important note, now same-sex couples have a much easier time deciding who to invite to their wedding and who to leave off the list.
in celebration, let's all reflect by rewatching bob katter's random outburst a week or so ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ih1eumlspy four people voted no in the parliament today.
bob katter russell broadbent david littleproud keith pitt http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-07/politics-live-december-7/9233194 this is what the final count looked like https://i.imgur.com/lwr3dz9.jpg noting that there were walkouts just before the vote, tony abbott included (our previous prime minister, for those non-australians in this thread).
edit: for those pming for a link i can't find a list of names as the list is behind a paywall on the daily telegraph, but [this page](http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/samesex-marriage-legalised-in-australia-as-parliament-passes-historic-law-20171206-h00cdj.html) says abbott did abstain.
his sister and her partner (gay, fyi) were present in the room though along with other lgtbi celebrities like ian thorpe and magda szubanski abbott walked out?
whoa.
i shouldn't be surprised, but the man did say he'd respect the vote of warringah and vote in favour accordingly.
absolutely gutless.
yep and his sister and her partner were in the room!
not very supportive.
you put that very mildly.
so why do they keep voting him in?
next election could be interesting?
because people in his electorate have relatively high incomes, and high income electorates like to vote lnp it really is that simple unfortunately oh, we heard plenty about that guy in the us.
seemed a real fuckhead.
[i've given you the response you deserve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amunessdy_g).
wtf actually happened to him here?
was he having a seizure?
it's actually my favourite video on australian politics ever the raw onion comes close but that is hilarious.
so you *do* have accurate reporting in the us.
i was under the impression that the aussies were ruled by a kola bear and aggressive human snake person?
you mean an emu got it in one, here he is eating an onion with the skin still on... yeah that sums it up perfectly who he is.
https://youtu.be/bw3o6qnzwmg at some point he must have thought "this was a mistake", but in slimy politician style he powered through on his error and doubled down yeah you can see him glance at the onion and see it register in his eyes that the skins still on... as if the skin still being on is the weirdest part that fucking demon!
look at him!
didn't even flinch.
yes.
he’s a shitcunt.
didn’t even have the conviction to vote the way he fought.
coward.
probably more the fact that he didn't want to vote against his electorate.
too right, i live in his electorate and there would have been quite an uproar had he voted no.
abstaining should outrage your electorate just as much 10th highest yes vote of all electorates if i'm not mistaken... katter didn't vote no.
he just wouldn't move from his seat for such a trivial issue, focussing instead on how to prevent people in north queensland getting torn apart by crocodiles every three months.
so, ummm, how do you prevent that?
cork the teeth?
marry them.
gorillas that thrive on croc meat honestly, i have more respect for these 4 than tony abbott, george christensen etc, who wanted to vote no but didn't want their faces in the lonely no side photos.
gutless fucking wonders.
(not a lot of respect though...) agreed.
i wouldn't be surprised if there was a decent number of yes voters today who are against same sex marriage, but only voted yes not to cause controversy and potentially not get re-elected down the track.
those four were obviously pretty open and content with publically voting no, the ones who left, not so much... well they are supposed to represent the people so if they want to avoid controversy and put aside their own beliefs, doesn't it mean that they are willing to stand for what people's want despite their own view ?
seems noble to me katter and broadbent sitting together as two males bonding over a common passion.
i love how he's having a laugh then snaps into serious mode when bringing up the crocs.
okay, we're going to send you winston peters and let him and mr. katter meet up, and we're going to tell them both that they're now the joint prime ministers of new australialand, and set up a fake parliament and everything and let them go at it while we film the whole thing for reality tv.
it'll be great that wouldn't be fair at all.
winston would murder him.
first with words, then with fists.
and then drinking.
can't decide if this would be better or worse than the block.
i've watched this a million times and can't stop laughing.
what a cooked unit.
kind of reminds me of that old bloke off a current affair years ago who started aggressively immitating a dog.
the change in mood is very similar hahah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbxy9g_rhdg they came bounding overaregheyayhygharauyaahwuh this made my day [he had an even better one yesterday in federal parliament.
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9v9uctvv6lc) edit: [his anecdote before this one is also wow](https://youtu.be/zyjlxvp2zlw?t=619) edit2: unbelievable this guy is a member of parliament.
from 13:00 in above video &gt;i watched on television last night, a murder case, involving two people of that persuasion, and when i came to the office today my chief of staff, who i might add voted yes, she said "oh so and so you better write them a letter, write them a card or something".
i said "what's that all about", "oh the son got murdered, joins a homosexual relationship".
&gt;there are some people that handle, there's no doubt there is a dna thing there, and some people can handle it, but a lot of people don't, and there is a very very ugly side to this, where the curtain comes down, and we're not allowed to talk about it.
holy shit.
why do people treat katter like he's a harmless joke, some kind of meme?
this is some pretty disgusting rhetoric.
what is he even referring to?
i am genuinely curious to read about this case of "72 children" getting hiv from blood transfusions in australia.
google isn't giving me anything.
it seems like he just made it up.
that's why it's never had any coverage.
it's hard to report on stories that spill out of this rednecks pie hole.
woah, i grew up in the north, never liked the guy.
he talks like his mind is deteriorating.
you're in the pub, having a drink with a couple mates.
one of them goes outside for a smoke and the other goes for a slash, so you're left alone for a couple minutes.
a guy comes out of nowhere and sits at the bar.
he's a little intoxicated, and a bit off (is it drugs?
mental illness?
unclear).
the guy clearly doesn't respect normal boundaries; he sits down across from you and starts talking.
by the time your mates are back you've heard his life story, how he has 2 kids down the coast that their mother doesn't let him see but he's been trying real hard to get a job so he might get to soon.
he tells you his theories about the government, how they're all out to get him and about how centrelink really fucked him over.
as your friends return he pulls out some cards, does a couple magic tricks, and asks you to buy him a beer.
that's bob katter.
i'd bet you all the money to my name that that "72 kids got hiv from blood donations" thing happened before 2000 (or, more likely, didn't happen at all).
hiv detection and treatment has improved drastically since the 90s and even more drastically since 2000. there's essentially no way you'd get a blood donation with hiv in it.
using "but what about hiv?"
to stop gay people from donating blood is just ridiculous today.
it's the job of those collecting the blood to test it, regardless of the sexual history of the donor (since every donation should be checked regardless; there are plenty of straight folks out there with hiv).
yeah, i don't think it happened at all.
even he's like "72 children... uh, 724 people... uhhhh, i don't know the exact numbers" throughout the speech.
oh my god what a tosser what in the fuck that change in attitude 😅.
is this a split sequel?
g'~~d~~ay mate time for a golden gaytime.
life's pretty straight without twisties!
$120 million later and it only took 10 seconds to vote on it the way that australians have wanted for over a decade.
what a waste of money, but nonetheless this is really good news!
the silver lining to that $100m cloud is that we now have a survey to show abbott and co that there is no silent majority like they claim, just a small bunch of shouty cunts.
they were right about the silent majority, just not about whose side they were on.
today it was abbott who was silent since he left the chambers shortly before the vote like a coward.
he slipped out, like the slimy cunt he is.
i reckon abbott will be shocked by how many cwa cake stalls were supporting the gays he probably thinks women still cant vote it took longer and cost more than it should have but we got there in the end.
good stuff.
that is indeed what matters most.
congrats aussies!
y'know what though?
at least now we can silence any annoying fucker who tries to claim the minority dictated the law change.
the loving majority won!
we wanted equality and we got it!
more important than that, it set a precedent that a minority can not impose religious based rules on others so much wasted time and money, while in the meantime every three months a person is torn to pieces by a crocodile in north queensland.
say what you will about the obscene invoice for the vote, but at least it settles this question for good and for all eternity.
a win for love!
i mean, it took a lot longer.
there was quite a bit of debate, with conservatives in the senate trying add a lot of amendments to protect homophobic businesses and churches.
honestly?
i can kinda see the benefit of the referendum now.
it was a 100m dollar exercise in idiocy, but at the same time it also showed the majority of australian politicians that there's overwhelming support, and that to try to dilute and modify it to add "freedom" protections wouldn't fly with the aussie public.
i honestly shudder to think the kind of bill that would've been enacted if the senate and hor hadn't concrete proof of the backlash they would've faced.
as it stands the bill essentially went through unmolested and unconditional, which is the best possible outcome.
so the postal survey, expensive?
yes.
political theatre?
absolutely.
incredibly hurtful and wedge-driving?
you bet your arse.
but entirely worthless?
now i'm not so sure... at least all the money was spent in australia.
#not fake and gay!
maybe a bit gay there are two ways you can interpret "not fake and gay": a: (not fake) and (gay) or: b: not (fake and gay) either interpretation can still be true if gay.
for a it is in fact required that gay be true, and for b any situation other than both fake and gay being true is fine.
(so it could be fake but not gay, or gay but not fake, or neither, just not both) so either way you aren't actually contradicting /u/generic-user-1 now "not fake *or* gay", that would be a different situation /r/unexpectedformallogic i guess all the terrible amendments that allowed businesses in the wedding industry to legally discriminate against same-sex couples have been defeated too, which is doubly good news!
honestly the most worrisome part for me.
not only because of the awful amendments themselves, but i was worried it would drag out the process.
so happy to see it passed quickly.
mainstream liberals headed that off pretty well i think.
they shot down patterson's bill and then said religious protections would be reviewed separately.
surprisingly adept politicking by turnbull, brandis etc.
that's really the only thing the liberal party did to support gay marriage.
&gt; surprisingly adept politicking by turnbull, brandis etc.
didn't think i'd be reading that comment this year.
holy shit guys i can get married!
🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈 now to find someone to get married to :/ i’ll marry you do it, you won't i’ll make a beautiful bride you go get married, and live an awesome life together!

hey, if it makes you feel better, the uk made gay sex punishable by law at one point.
so did many countries and it still is in some places.
canada even made a "fruit machine" to detect gay people to try to keep them out of civil service.
and this was only 50 years ago.
being a homosexual was punishable by death in early australia shit's pretty fucked up you forgot ireland in 2015 the first country to legalise it by popular vote!
it was the first vote i ever took part in after turning 18. i felt such a great sense of pride when the results came in did you also feel a sense of accomplishment?
&gt; today: australia so still 2017 nah we are in the future.
nz on the other hand are already in 2019!
pretty sure this is missing a few countries isn't it legal in britain?
england, wales and scotland legalised it in 2014, it is still unavailable in northern ireland and probably will be for some time due to the first minister using petitions of concern to block any bill which would legislate to allow same-sex marriage.
[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/same-sex_marriage_in_the_united_kingdom) that awkward moment where the catholic part of the island legalized gay marriage first.
catholics on the island have been less conservative than the protestants for a while now.
in the protestants defence though, the party that a lot of them tend to vote for is more conservative than they are.
in our defense australians have been after this for fucking ages.
it was just a handful of bigots in power stopping this.
including a very spineless labor government that had a majority to do it several years ago.
never forget.
austria did it a couple of days ago.

i haven't gotten to that episode of obvious civil rights yet.
[called it 6 months ago.
](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/6d0tm1/taiwan_top_court_rules_samesex_marriage_legal_a/dhyvs2f/) this season is so predictable.
also for the record for any foreigners, this government basically did everything they could to delay this for as long as possible.
they deserve none of the credit.
and wasted 120 million dollars on a postal survey one particular politician from the oposition who is being being trotted out is [tim wilson proposing to his boyfriend](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-04/tim-wilson-proposes-in-house-of-reps-same-sex-marriage-bill/9222834) after the bill was introduced into the house of reps. as if he is some rainbow beacon for other homosexual couples.
the guy is an absolute cunt and has [a voting record to match.
](http://www.openaustralia.org.au/mp/tim_wilson/goldstein) how tim wilson voted on key issues since 2006: * voted very strongly against increasing trade unions' powers in the workplace.
* voted very strongly against implementing refugee and protection conventions.
* voted very strongly against increasing investment in renewable energy.
* voted very strongly for privatising government assets.
* voted very strongly against increasing aboriginal land rights.
* voted very strongly against increasing funding for university education.
* voted strongly for decreasing availability of welfare payments.
* voted very strongly against increasing restrictions on gambling like we see from conservative politicians all over the globe, they are willing to shit on peoples rights until it directly impacts them.
well, gay people can still be conservative cunts.
that's what i would call progress.
it's amazing.
i just spent three weeks down there and the amount of rainbow flags and signs in almost every store window was really heartwarming.
in melbourne it felt like everyone was so connected by it, nothing like where i'm from in the states.
melbourne is a very american definition of liberal city.
they even legalised euthanasia.
small 'l'.
yeah.
we're liberal cunts.
not liberal cunts.
spent so long looking for a erroneous capital i. heart wrenching moment when the house started singing we are australian.

if you’re australian and you don’t love that song, you’re not australian i'm not particularly patriotic (gunning to move to europe in a few years), but fuck me, does that song pull on the heartstrings.
an absolutely beautiful moment when the people started singing.
it really should be our national anthem absolutely.
advance australia fair does nothing for me.
we are australian actually makes me feel something.
any chance of a link to that?
i don't know if i'm doing this right, but [here...maybe](https://www.facebook.com/abcnews.au/videos/10157742452844988/) **marriage for the boiz** and grzzz aussie aussie aussie oi oi oi oi oi oi oi oi oi what happened to that couple from australia who heartened to divorce if gay marriage was ever legalized?
[hastily backtracking.
](http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/11/14/australian-couple-who-vowed-to-divorce-if-same-sex-marriage-is-legalised-unsure-of-future/) &gt;the spouses, who have been married for a decade, have said that they will hold out until any new legislation regarding same-sex marriage is released.
&gt;“we just need to see the legislation and if it all goes that way,” mr jensen said.
&gt;he added: “then we know what situation we’re in and what we’re going to do.” [backtracking so fast he needs reversing beeps.

&gt;“the legislation currently makes it untenable for us to do this under the law.
the point we were highlighting and that still stands however is the fact that a redefinition of marriage changes the agreement under which we were originally married.
&gt;“we will be making no further comment.” fucking lol.
as if people would buy that shit they should feature in a r/wcgw.
or /r/quityourbullshit public gallery erupts into chorus of 'i am australian' after parliament votes to legalise same-sex marriage - https://twitter.com/abcnews/status/938669095657947136 it was so heartbreaking listening to the hateful and venomous campaign rhetoric that the australian lgbt community had to endure over these months.
growing up gay is hard enough without argument over your rights and humanity being part of everyday conversation.
i only hope this vote brings some closure and relief.
much love from california to my aussie brothers and sisters.
❤ i was watching the verdict online for about an hour before it got put into law.
the amount of blabbering idiots that tried to get their amendments in was astonishing.
thank god they were all voted down !

we are one, but we are many and from all the lands on earth we come we'll share a dream and sing with one voice i am, you are, we are australian.
this really should be our anthem *you have reached the modern era.
* /r/unexpectedciv/ the ~~plebiscite~~ non-compulsory non-binding opinion poll was a waste of time and money but i'm glad we got to this point.
we didn't have a plebiscite.
we had a non-compulsory non-binding opinion poll
[removed] this graham guy sounds like a bit of a cunt and i'm pretty sure that if he was a muslim saying similar things about christians there wouldn't be much concern here about banning him from entering the uk.
that said i don't generally agree with banning people from the country just because they're a bit of a cunt.
&gt; that said i don't generally agree with banning people from the country just because they're a bit of a cunt.
that's my thinking as well.
just let people like that come over here, they have a right to express their views and if it's controversial then his opponents have the same right of protest and freedom of expression to express their view that his views are disgusting.
free speech/expression goes all ways.
the only line we should draw with this is where actual rights are infringed - e.g.
threats or inciting violence.
the uk doesn't have a _universal_ right to free speech like the us, most countries don't in fact.
the uk, like many european countries however _does_ have laws against hate speech.
he's only entitled to express his views in so far as the law allows.
&gt;the uk doesn't have a universal right to free speech like the us i think you'll find the us doesn't either.. arrested for tweets.. http://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/17/us/twitter-journalist-strobe-epilepsy/index.html or saying fuck https://www.alternet.org/civil-liberties/cursing-out-police-perfectly-legal-cops-routinely-arrest-people-it or saying fuck on a 911 call https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/4cn426/17_year_old_calls_911_to_help_dying_father_gets/ or laughing http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/348857-woman-arrested-for-laughing-in-sessions-hearing-heading-back-to or pretending to face fuck jesus https://nypost.com/2014/09/12/teen-could-face-prison-after-simulating-sex-act-with-jesus-statue/ pretending to face fuck jesus isn't really speech.
speech involves conveying ideas through words.
statues can't give consent.
he raped the statue.
statue-atory rape is a serious crime and we cannot be lenient!
i heard you can't fuck statues in the italian town of pisa, but with the tower they are very lenient.
so do you think it's okay that he got arrested for pretending to face fuck a statue??
like seriously how is that okay??
it was more an example of what you could get arrested for in the us.. i mean if that was a statue of mohammed and you got arrested people would be calling it a caliphate, but because it's jesus it's okay!
just as a side note mohammed does not get displayed in islam.
so that makes this specifically that jesus is protected in america i'd doubt that there are laws that specificly protect jesus.
if he would have done it with a hindu god he would probably also have been charged for the same crime.
pretending to face fuck a statue is a crime in america?
well who knew.. &gt;arrested for tweets.. it’s not that simple &gt;an additional charge has been filed against a maryland man accused of tweeting an animated strobe image to a journalist with epilepsy, prosecutors in texas said monday.
&gt;a grand jury referral said rivello sent the tweet knowing journalist kurt eichenwald was "susceptible to seizures and that such animations are capable of causing seizures."
the document said rivello used "a deadly weapon, to wit: a tweet and a graphics interchange format (gif) and an electronic device and hands during the commission of the assault."
&gt;the flashing image was sent to eichenwald, a newsweek senior writer and vanity fair contributing editor, on december 15 and came with the message: "you deserve a seizure for your post," according to the federal criminal complaint.
eichenwald said the image triggered a seizure and he then sought to identify the person who sent it.
http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/man-arrested-for-parody-police-twitter-account-in-miami-beach-9725564 &gt;miami beach police arrest man for making parody police twitter account better?
impersonating a police officer.
no no a police spokesman.
keep reaching now.. what about this one?
http://www.nydailynews.com/news/island-def-jam-records-exec-james-roppo-arrested-tweens-riot-justin-bieber-signing-article-1.418355 this guy got arrested for not tweeting.police asked roppo to send out a tweet telling the crowd to go away.
roppo didn't cooperate and was arrested.
why is that a crime???
should the government force him to tweet something?
what is this totalitarian society of the us?
&gt;no no a police spokesman.
still an active police officer, just in public relations.
however, this example does seem to be a bit of a stretch.
so you agree that he should be arrested for parody?
in the us?
what about the girl that laughed?
https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/05/jeff-sessions-protester-charged-laughing &gt;the justice department prosecuted desiree fairooz for “disorderly and disruptive conduct” jesus america for fucking laughing?!
i know you guys *hate* swearing as already shown but; https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/12/02/moms-conviction-swearing-son-over-burnt-popcorn-upheld-high-court/916189001/ &gt;mom's conviction for swearing at son over burnt popcorn upheld by high court seriously, i see the whole us is a bastion of free speech in the world, and yet.... it blatantly isn't.
yeah neither does the us dude.. what did he say exactly?
if you read the article &gt;he claimed that barack obama was “born a muslim” and had allowed the muslim brotherhood to infiltrate the us government at the highest levels during his presidency.
he also said the obama administration was pushing “a gay and lesbian agenda”, and he has spoken out against lgbt rights, saying satan is behind same-sex marriage.
one thing i will never understand is why christian extremists and muslim extremists hate each other so much, they have so many common goals.
seems like same people who preach fear of sharia law coming to the us want the same thing, just under a different name.
thats like asking why hells angels and bandidos hate each other when they look so similar from an outside perspective.
it's actually quite ancient.
both christian/jewish &amp; muslim scriptures lay claim to a "chosen" linage... two different sons of abraham.
christians teach that abraham was sinful when he and a handmaiden gave birth to a son 'ishmael' and muslims teach that he is the chosen son.
jews &amp; christians teach about a second son 'isaac' and believe that he is.
both lay claim to abraham and i'm not sure about any other comparisons between the two religions prior to that.
no one is born any religion.
what an incredibly stupid thing to say.
would you ban a terrorist?
is there a difference between someone who calls for violence and human rights violations against people and someone who actually does it?
it's the thought that counts.
ban the cunt, he wants only to radicalize more religious warriors.
&gt;nina parker, the pastor of liberty church in blackpool and the organiser of the petition, said: “as a christian and as a leader of a church that particularly welcomes lgbt people, i’m horrified that other local churches are inviting someone with this record of hate speech.” has she banned the bible from her own church?
a lot christianity is less rigid on the bible.
a lot open the whole thing to interpretation.
although it could be argued that she is following the teachings of christ directly who said to love all and eat with the sinners.
ya well a lot of things in the bible can be taken as sort of open to interpretation.
however on some things it’s pretty clear.
homosexuality is pretty blatantly and openly denounced in the bible.
it really isn’t open to interpretation.
if you consider yourself a true christian, then you abhor homosexuality since it’s a sin.
so is lying, gossip, and greed, which are lumped together with sexual transgressions: &gt;"i wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people— not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters.
in that case you would have to leave this world.
but now i am writing to you that you must not associate *with anyone who claims to be a brother or sister* but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or slanderer, a drunkard or swindler.
do not even eat with such people."
the thing is, in 1 corinthians 5, where paul is writing about this, he's not talking about non-christians.
he's talking about christians.
this is where the church gets it so wrong.
christians are hard on non-believers, and lenient on each other, when it should be the other way around.
you can abhor the sin without abhoring the sinner.
you shouldn't accept the sin.
but the person should be treated like everyone else.
we all sin.
gay people are no different.
i’ll treat any human being like a person and with dignity because we all have human rights.
but i absolutely do not need to accept a homosexual person with open arms nor do i need to change the way i live my life to make a rare thing like homosexuality seem more “normal”.
no one is forcing you to be gay so why care?
10% of the human population is gay, homosexuality has been observed in nature in a wide range of species including lions, birds and whales.
it might not be the sexuality of the majority but it definitely occurs in nature, so it's natural by definition.
how does someone else being gay impact the way you live your life?
on the other hand, what does him saying anything effect a person being gay?
i say it's open to interpretation because it's old testament law which is taken way less seriously than living like jesus which is the whole point of christianity.
it's not strictly old testament and through a long conversation with the people who say they're are christian and support homosexuality, you'll usually find they support, because they were told a lie or they believe the bible itself is full of errors and the interpretation is separate from the bible content.
&gt; they believe the bible itself is full of errors it's hardly something you have to believe - the bible is full of errors and contradictions.
&gt;if you consider yourself a true christian, then you abhor ~~homosexuality~~ wearing garments produced with mixed fabrics since it’s a sin.
christ you fuckwitted christian taliban bigots are boring.
wow, ok, if you'd do any googling at all, you'd see that there are new testament that specifically condemn it.
i'm sorry, but people who say "you're a hypocrite for cherry picking ot customs to follow" are entirely ignorant.
if you're a true christian then you should also not eat shellfish, shave your beard, plant wheat and barley in the same field or wear polyester.
it's also in deuteronomy iirc.
stop cherry picking actually, the food rules were lifted in acts.
btw the beard is with a razor.
polyester is not forbidden either.
&gt;ya well a lot of things in the bible can be taken as sort of open to interpretation.
you mean like the things that don't happen to support your personal prejudices?
get fucked cunt.
it's just an excuse to do whatever you please and claim "i believe god said this is ok so leave me alone".
call me edgy idgaf but i'm sick of people who claim to be religious with absolutely no moral fibre.
and strictly said marriage is between one man and one woman.
nope sorry, that's changed.
sorry to burst your bubble it hasnt.
open to interpretation = pretending much of the bible doesn't exist.
why is she complaining about hate speech when the bible is full of hate speech?
christ was quoting from leviticus (old testament) when he commanded people to love their neighbour, so you can imagine that sort of love is not necessarily how modern people define love.
the message of christ is still that you'll burn in hell for eternity if you don't believe in him.
the new testament continues the old testament's message that gays should be killed (romans 1:32).
that is technically hate speech.
i mean, gods not gonna force you into heaven if you don't want to go, even heaven will be hell for the people who don't want god, hell is merely the absence of god, which reflects how we lived our lives, without god, heaven is the presence of god which reflects how we lived our lives with god.
we put ourselves where we ultimately end up at the end of our lives.
cause.
effect.
also the message of christianity is that jesus christ came down and gave himself as a sacrifice and died for our sins, so that we can live pure holy lives and at the end we can be with him for eternity.
he came because he loved us.
but imagine pure love without borders, is essentially a choice for the other person to accept it or not, we freely make the decision on whether to accept christ as he freely came down to save us and set us free.
well the bible basically tells us that if we don't believe in a magic superbeing without evidence then we'll get tortured for eternity.
why is god good again?
believing something without having evidence is just evidence of that person's gullability, it's not something to be proud of.
we have enough evidence to make a choice with faith, thats the whole point, is having faith, if you don't want to believe that is purely your choice, thats why jesus still came down and died and suffered, knowing that people wouldn't believe you know?
sort of how we love someone and willing to give everything even when they are off putting or not agreeing.
believing something without evidence is more powerful than you think, even then i believe there is just enough evidence for us to look into in jesus and christianity, to make a solid decision, whether its no or yes, god respects it.
all love my friend !
because it's contradictory to the whole love everyone and eat with the sinners message that was the main draw for people.
not everyone takes it literally.
whenever someone says “as a christian” it’s a good sign that they aren’t don't christians follow the teachings of christ?
can you quote in the bible where christ said anything about lgbt people?
christ boiled it down to two tenets: love god.
love your neighbor as yourself.
it's clear to me that he made no qualifications or caveats as to whom your neighbor might be, simply that one should love them irrespective of any/all other factors.
christians are meant to believe christ is god, and therefore when god told paul that gays are worthy of death (romans 1:32), then it's part of christianity.
so... you can't quote anything christ said then.
he limited marriage to one man and one woman.
so if a man has sex with a man it is outside marriage and is a form of fornication.
did you read what i wrote, and do you know what christianity is?
christianity isn't just what jesus directly said.
the bible is homophobic, and it's impossible to have a christianity that endorses homosexuality without shredding major aspects of basic christian doctrine.
there is lots of whataboutism going on in this thread trying to distract from the fact that the remarks are still enough to ban people from entering the us.
other people's actions don't distract from the reality of this person's actions.
&gt; the remarks are still enough to ban people from entering the us.
they are?
apparently, from the people wanting him banned it is enough.
personally i would like people like him out of the us for as long as possible.
&gt; pparently, from the people wanting him banned it is enough.
i'm not sure what that means.
i'm talking about law.
&gt;the remarks are still enough to ban people from entering the us.
based on what?
citation needed.
per kleindienst v. mandel, the us can bar entry to non-citizens based on their speech, even when their speech would be protected by the first amendment if it was said by a citizen.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/hate_speech_laws_in_the_united_kingdom.
it is in the first paragraph.
you said banned from the us, not uk.
you can be arrested for saying things on twitter in the uk.
&gt;you can be arrested for saying things on twitter in the uk as you can in the us.. http://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/17/us/twitter-journalist-strobe-epilepsy/index.html or saying fuck https://www.alternet.org/civil-liberties/cursing-out-police-perfectly-legal-cops-routinely-arrest-people-it or saying fuck on a 911 call https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/4cn426/17_year_old_calls_911_to_help_dying_father_gets/ or laughing http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/348857-woman-arrested-for-laughing-in-sessions-hearing-heading-back-to or pretending to face fuck jesus https://nypost.com/2014/09/12/teen-could-face-prison-after-simulating-sex-act-with-jesus-statue/ seriously the us is waaay way gone.
tweeting an opinion and getting arrested is one thing, tweeting a strobe to someone you know has epilepsy and getting arrested is another.
do you think being arrested for laughing is okay?
absolutely not.
different issue though.
so what about tweeting as a parody?
https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/10/miami-beach-cops-arrest-man-for-twitter-parody-of-police-spokesman/ &gt;miami beach cops arrest man for twitter parody of police spokesman like seriously.. it says in the article that impersonating an officer is a felony... what did that guy do?
yeah, impersonate an officer.
i would never dress up like a cop and run around telling people shit.
while this does seem to be new territory i can see how they would reasonably extend that prohibition online.
is the spokesman of a police department an actual police officer?
not sure the definitions are the same.
even if they are, tweets.. arrested for non-violent tweets.
this is the best tl;dr i could make, [original](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/07/us-evangelical-preacher-franklin-graham-uk-critics) reduced by 89%.
(i'm a bot) ***** &gt; graham, 65, the son of the evangelical preacher billy graham, is to be the main speaker at the lancashire festival of hope at blackpool&amp;#039;s winter gardens in september 2018.
&gt; the blackpool festival - organised by the billy graham evangelical association, of which franklin graham is president and ceo - is being supported by a number of anglican clergy and churches in the blackpool area.
&gt; two opponents of graham&amp;#039;s visit, the blackpool vicars andrew sage and tracy charnock, have written an open letter to the bishop of blackburn, julian henderson, calling on him to distance himself from the us evangelist.

| *top* *keywords*: **graham**^#1 **blackpool**^#2 **visit**^#3 **church**^#4 **told**^#5 yeah...not a big fan of graham people followed him out of respect for his father, but frank left the path a while ago.
his words are nothing like those of the christ, and by encouraging fundamentalism he does more violence to our faith than any suicide bomber ever could.
his religious teachings are pulled from the bible, but they fall far short of the heart of christ, so they have little true worth.
if he wants to act like peter and chop the ears off those he sees as a threat in the name of his faith, whether the threat is real or not, he will soon discover that jesus is too busy repairing their wounds to appreciate his zeal.
his lack of humility and strong influence will pull many away from a relationship with christ and instead bind them to religious teachings that suit his political beliefs.
i'll speak out against then to anyone who will listen.
bingo.
billy graham is a great man.
his son frank is a right asshole.
and billy is too sick to pull his son by the ear and tell him to knock it the hell off.
more people need to.
these people do great harm to religion.
so have you listened to the many european imams bigoted commentaries?
or are the scriptural tenets of only christian beliefs repeated verbally just conveniently hate speech.this agnostic wants to know.
i think you've answered your own question here.
europe has enough of its own home grown, ass backwards hate figures without importing redneck trash from the states.
&gt;or are the scriptural tenets of only christian beliefs repeated verbally just conveniently hate speech this is a weird way of putting it because it's almost like you want people to think the proposed ban is on all christians, when actually it's specifically targeting this single piece of fundamentalist shit.
i'm doubly confused because the article (which, of course, you read in detail before commenting) actually contains quotes from the person spearheading this petition, who is herself not only a christian, but is actually a pastor of her own congregation.
so yeah, i don't know, it's almost like you aren't arguing in good faith (pun intended) and are deliberately omitting pertinent details so that you can spin this story in a manner that justifies your own latent bias.
i think the point they're trying to make is that britain would be hypocritical for banning graham from attending but not cracking down on radical imams.
edit: i don't agree with them, i'm just saying what their message was.
elaboration != endorsement.
yeah, except they actually jailed anjem choudary's fat ass.
on second thought, maybe graham should be allowed entry... i don't particularly think arresting and imprisoning a person for words is a justified thing unless those words are an incitement to violence.
there's a pretty stark and clear difference in my opinion between "gays are wrong" and "gays should all i die, let's go stone them," for example.
one is worthy of arrest, one isn't worthy of much more than social ostracism.
actually processing these people and charging them is just a waste of time and resources that could be spent catching actual criminals.
let's explore some of mr graham's rhetoric.
https://www.glaad.org/cap/franklin-graham on lgbt rights: &gt;this is a full-scale assault against christianity and the followers of christ.
when prayer is banned from the public square, when our president fails to defend biblically defined marriage, and he openly and zealously advocates for gay rights; when legislators rush to overrule existing laws to promote gay marriage; when schools and courts consistently suppress religious freedoms; we know we are locked in a war against the christian faith, not culture.
the architect behind this offensive is none other than satan himself.
the scripture says that the devil, our archenemy, is bent on as much destruction as possible.
is that really miles away from concepts like "holy war" or "jihad"?
if i'm gay and i hear that, i don't just think, "wow, this guy's a fucking asshole".
i think, "wow, this is vaguely threatening."
i'm bisexual and while i can see the inferences one could quite easily draw from that, i still don't agree with the concept of someone saying something "vaguely threatening" being worthy of jail time.
by that logic, you should be able to arrest someone for looking at you kind of angry once or twice because it is also "vaguely" threatening and they could be planning to assault you.
you can't arrest people for crimes they may have the propensity to commit, only crimes they've actually committed, he's not out there assaulting people and he's not out there saying "all my crazy evangelical followers, go with a fiery wrath and kill the gays" is he?
i don't think people should accept what he is saying, but not accepting what someone is saying and private institutions or churches not allowing him to preach at their area is a world of difference between putting the man in prison for it.
its pretty hard to ban citizens, much easier to reject visas &gt; without importing redneck trash from the states you do know that redneck is a derogatory term for poor whites right?
also, why are you glazing over racist muslim clerics?
&gt;i'm doubly confused because the article (which, of course, you read in detail before commenting) actually contains quotes from the person spearheading this petition, who is herself not only a christian, but is actually a pastor of her own congregation.
so one christian represents all christians all of a sudden?
i wonder what's that called/s.
&gt; so yeah, i don't know, it's almost like you aren't arguing in good faith (pun intended) and are deliberately omitting pertinent details so that you can spin this story in a manner that justifies your own latent bias.
lol did you even read that he's agnostic?
also, a bit ironic considering you are glazing over details yourself.
&gt;you do know that redneck is a derogatory term for poor whites right?
no, it's a derogatory term for whites of a certain cultural demographic with backwards, insular political and social views.
i've known red necks who drive around in new model $50,000 pick-up trucks.
&gt; so one christian represents all christians all of a sudden?
i wonder what's that called/s.
uh no, i'm saying the opposite of that, actually.
i was responding to a conflation the op made with this fanatic and mainstream christians.
the pastor is certainly more representative of your average christian (in europe, anyway).
but the holy books from the 3 abrahamic religions all contain hate speech.
lmao so much for free speech throughout the entire western world meanwhile “the red carpet is being rolled out for our hero’s returning from syria to continue the fight at home.” yeah, you guys are worried about him, i think you guys need to be more concerned with the radical islamists that are currently taking over the north part of your country.
really don't understand classifying what graham says as hate speech.
here is him on pierce morgan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fergegplfs he articulates his stance well and very specifically stands against hate.
makes sense.
if you travel to another country, you should try to fit in with that country, and not bring your 'cultural' bullshit with you.
this standard should apply to this guy as much as it should to immigrants and refugees.
when did the uk become such a police state?
what are you on about?
it's been like this a long time.
hate speech has been banned for years i guess i always thought of the uk as a liberal democracy.
i didn't realize that so many people there hated free expression or other liberal ideals.
jesus a police state?
in the us police literally kill citizens with impunity and never get charged arrested for tweets in the us.. http://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/17/us/twitter-journalist-strobe-epilepsy/index.html or saying fuck https://www.alternet.org/civil-liberties/cursing-out-police-perfectly-legal-cops-routinely-arrest-people-it or saying fuck on a 911 call https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/4cn426/17_year_old_calls_911_to_help_dying_father_gets/ or laughing http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/348857-woman-arrested-for-laughing-in-sessions-hearing-heading-back-to or pretending to face fuck jesus https://nypost.com/2014/09/12/teen-could-face-prison-after-simulating-sex-act-with-jesus-statue/ seriously the us is waaay way gone.
for awhile now, canada has the same freedom of speech problems if not worse.
“the evangelist, who backed donald trump in last year’s us presidential election, has described islam as “an evil and very wicked religion” and has equated the actions of extremist groups such as isis with the faith.” if telling the truth gets you banned from our country we are in very sad place christianity is pretty evil too.
i reckon we should implement a christian ban on people from entering the uk?
calling isis muslim is like calling the columbine shooters high schoolers.
sure, it's true, but that doesn't mean that you can say that high schoolers are shooters.
only a few of them are, and believe it or not, most of their victims are more of the same (high schoolers... er... muslims... er... you know what i mean) in most cases.
it's intellectually dishonest (not to mention lazy) to equate islam with isis for that reason.
uk and eu dont have freedom of speech like america does and in this case id be glad for it.
they separate church and state .
stupid religious fanatics of any kind should be banned worldwide spreading hate and inciting violence actually is illegal.
freedom os speech in america and right to protest only.
is legal if u dont do either of those.
too bad nutjobs and idiots dont know the difference.
cg on uk for thinking of banning.
its thier right to allow whoever they want or not want in country and we the united states need to stopwith our bullshit &gt;they separate church and state so all those state-funded muslim schools in the uk are examples of their "separation of church and state"?
the queen being the head of the church of england - which again is state funded, is "separation of church and state"?
i mean, we have state-funded catholic schools here in the us, so it's not like it's unprecedented.
apparently we don't.
wikipedia: &gt;[in the 19th century] most states passed a state constitutional amendment, referred to as the blaine amendment, forbidding tax money be used to fund parochial schools.... in 2002, the united states supreme court partially vitiated these amendments, in theory, when they ruled that vouchers were constitutional if tax dollars followed a child to a school, even if it were religious.
however, no state had, by 2009, changed its laws to allow this.
what are you talking about?
[this has been happening in cities like milwaukee for years now](http://www.businessinsider.com/catholic-schools-voucher-programs-study-2017-2).
are you just blindly quoting a semi-relevant snippet of wikipedia or something?
the voucher system is not "state funding" religious schools - it is literally "tax dollars following" an individual child to that particular school, religious or not.
if it weren't, the courts would again rule vouchers unconstitutional - and they haven't.
a state-funded school is where x amount tax dollars go *directly* to a school, unconnected to any particular child.
that *would* be unconstitutional.
i see.
so tax dollars pay for a kids schooling, vs. tax dollars paying for a kid's schooling.
it's so simple!
apparently the minds on the supreme court are not as sharp as yours.
i'm not claiming to be a top mind here.
i'm just saying that it's basically picking at semantics to call the voucher system so vastly different from "state funding" that you'd bother dismissing it entirely for a meaningless internet argument, when it amounts to the same thing.
with the "state funded" option, the catholic school stays open regardless of enrollment, but the students who go there benefit from the money spent there.
with the voucher system, the catholic schools with the highest enrollment stay open, and the students benefit from the money spent there.
we're not comparing apples and oranges here; it's more like comparing granny smiths and delicious instead.
the only real difference is that we're just growing apples that feed people more efficiently.
but the state is still paying for all of them, via tax dollars.
&gt; i'm just saying that it's basically picking at semantics as i said, scotus disagrees.
lol you seen the recent shit the us has done??

agreed.
all those imams in the uk who are radicalizing kids, and spreading anti-gay messages should be removed.
when was the christian crusade when they went stomping around the us cutting off heads and killing and raping and selling women and children into slavery i guess the uk should be worried he might ralley all those christian hate mongers to have there own crusade like we have in the states christians are killing non christians in the name of almighty god?
in the united states?
right now?
do tell!
&gt; went stomping around the us cutting off heads and killing and raping and selling women and children into slavery that's yemen, not the us, and it's muslims who are doing it.
i didn't know that's what he preached!
is he a slave owner?
did he participate in the crusades?
we have this happening in the states?!
what's with your random capitalizing of letters?
there's something really serial-killer about that.
he'll just carve another notch in his mfj (martyr for jeebus) belt.
he sounds like one of those drunk old cunts you get in every local pub.
but then you have uk people welcoming isis defectors with open arms.
k. wich uk people are they then mate?
if we make lots of noise so a police presence becomes necessary,we can hit them with the bill, just like milo.
if they loose money they will stop coming.
not surprising considering the uk’s anti-free speech laws.
edit: downvotes for stating facts?
wow!
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/hate_speech_laws_in_the_united_kingdom you mean like the us?
arrested for tweets.. http://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/17/us/twitter-journalist-strobe-epilepsy/index.html or saying fuck https://www.alternet.org/civil-liberties/cursing-out-police-perfectly-legal-cops-routinely-arrest-people-it or saying fuck on a 911 call https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/4cn426/17_year_old_calls_911_to_help_dying_father_gets/ or laughing http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/348857-woman-arrested-for-laughing-in-sessions-hearing-heading-back-to or pretending to face fuck jesus https://nypost.com/2014/09/12/teen-could-face-prison-after-simulating-sex-act-with-jesus-statue/ john rivello had charges dropped months later.
that was on the basis that he knowingly tried to give someone a seizure.
would be the same if you set up a strobe light in someone’s house to induce one.
all the cases cited in the article have been thrown out or dropped.
people get arrested all the time for things they didn’t do or don’t deserve to.
it’s the police’s job to sort out if this constitutes a crime.
sometimes not, sometimes it does.
saying fuck on 911 call lacks any follow up or write up.
assuming she was let go since it would have been an easy aclu case.
poorly handled call more than anything.
laughing is a bit more complicated then that.
they were also parading on capital grounds which is what she was first found guilty of.
first appeal threw it out though.
so it isn’t just laughing.
the teen got 6 months probation and community service for what equates to trolling.
he’s also a minor so it won’t effect him past 18. not the strongest case considering doing this to any public religious display will get you in trouble.
little bit different from stuff like this.
https://www.google.com/amp/www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/arrests-for-offensive-facebook-and-twitter-posts-soar-in-london-a7064246.html%3famp article unfortunately doesn’t cover convictions, but cites at least one at the bottom.

&gt;article unfortunately doesn’t cover convictions, but cites at least one at the bottom.
convicted for 2 years before it was overturned.
your article talks about inciting violence and as you say the only conviction it covers is as follows; &gt;in 2010, paul chambers was convicted under the communications act after tweeting a joke about blowing up robin hood airport in nottingham.
his conviction was overturned after a two-year legal battle.
for threatening to blow up an airport, do you think he shouldn't be arrested for this?
if not i have news for you.. in the us; http://www.mlive.com/news/bay-city/index.ssf/2017/09/teen_gets_jail_probation_for_t.html &gt;teen gets jail for threatening to shoot up school http://wgntv.com/2017/11/15/teen-arrested-after-threatening-to-shoot-up-wauconda-h-s-on-snapchat/ &gt;teen arrested after threatening to shoot up wauconda school on snapchat that one was on snapchat!!

sooooo basically... america already does this shit and more.
seriously if you can get arrested for fucking *laughing* you have a problem.
you do realize he was threatening to blow up a make believe airport right?
you should probably be a little more conscientious before replying.
threatening violence isn’t protected speech.
so it’s not surprising those became arrests.
saying mean things, racist, bigoted things is protected.
unlike the uk, where you have this.
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/merseyside/8640048.stm where you spend 6 months in jail for putting out anti-religious cartoons.
care to compare some more?

happens everyday in the us.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/hate_speech_laws_in_the_united_kingdom whole wikipedia page on it.
while this does cover the basic threats against someone different, it also covers benign acts like insults and displays against.
as i already pointed out, she wasn’t arrested for laughing.
she was arrested and convicted for parading on capital grounds.
[removed] well then i retract that.
not from the area, so it’s kind of hard to connect robin hood in nottingham with doncaster.
again, charges were dropped against elliot madison.
the charge was helping people breaking the law evade police.
james roppo was an event organizer and refused to help quell a hysteric crowd.
another case of no follow up so no clue what happened.
the last example is a thinly veiled threat against the president of the united states.
ready to reroll again?
still waiting on a conviction for speech.
especially after i linked you a few in the uk.
&gt;well then i retract that you literally told me to be more conscientious while simultaneously being ignorant as fuck.
you have no credibility.
seriously why do you think the us is some bastion of free speech?
&gt;refused to help quell a hysteric crowd so?
why is that a crime???
should the government *force* him to tweet something?
what is this totalitarian society of the us?
&gt;thinly veiled threat again, so???
people tweet shit to theresa may all the time and yet nothing happens.
you are honestly hilarious no credibility for owning my mistakes?
interesting ideology.
because the us is.
you have yet to provide one case of someone being convicted over speech, when i have already pointed multiple cases in the uk.
it’s starting to sound like you’re just a “whataboutism” acolyte.
it’s called good samaritan law.
if you have to potential to prevent harm or a crime and you refuse to, you become culpable.
so you think it’s ok to threaten violence against the heads of state?
yet you agree that threats of shooting up a school is a crime?
you’re inconsistent.
it’s illegal threaten anyone with violence.
hilarious how?
for rebutting every single one of your claims and not being able to rebut any of mine?
you do have some interesting definitions.
i have provided countless times where someone has been convicted of tweets, such as the obama tweet etc, your inability to realise that inciting violence isn't okay in the uk either and falls under "hate speech laws" such as "lets go kill all the muslims" is utterly hilarious to me.
&gt;you do realize he was threatening to blow up a make believe airport right?
you should probably be a little more conscientious before replying.
holy shit the irony hahahaha it was a real airport omg you idiot care to show that?
because google says you’re wrong.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doncaster_sheffield_airport &gt;doncaster sheffield airport (iata: dsa, icao: egcn), **formerly named robin hood airport doncaster sheffield,** hahahahaha holy shit you are so dense!!
dense for not knowing a specific airport in a country i don’t live in?
interesting.
i retract my statement then.
lol what a tool, calling out someone for not being aware of something while you aren't yourself absolute joke ahaha do you really feel like you're proving anything at all by listing only 5 examples in a country of 323 million people?
i'm saying if you can get arrested for *laughing* you can't really say "anti-free speech laws" without admitting the us has them too well, i mean, you *could* say that.
but then you'd be a hypocrite.
indeed so seems like most of your examples don't actually hold up when put under scrutiny, however.
they really do though... she's being charged for laughing.
and *parody*?
https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/10/miami-beach-cops-arrest-man-for-twitter-parody-of-police-spokesman/ follow up sources on most of the cases you linked showed the charges were dropped, except on the laughing one i can't find anything about that.
there's a bit of a difference between police wrongfully charging you with something and then dropping it and being charged with something, being found guilty and being genuinely locked up for it.
i'm not saying that things like that have never happened in the us, they have, but its a lot more rare and typically less socially accepted than in the uk where hate speech laws can sometimes get very out of hand.
do you think inciting violence should be a crime?
if not.. then the us is wrong too then ?

🤔🤔 with a lot of free time and boredom the clever man uses ctrl+c and ctrl+v [removed] fuck yourself, nazi /s?
he frequents nazi subreddits and posts anti-semitic caricatures online tax the lobbyists!
at this point we might as well have a fixed amount of tax payed by each business segment - collected by themselves - like medieval guilds (or roman knights) but then these companies would be forced to divert some of their bribe money into taxes.
couldn’t have that now could we?
we can but only if they can be written off as a cost of doing business.
it's cheaper to 'donate' to both nlp and alp than pay tax.
they still pay, just a much smaller amount and directly where it matters to ensure the legislation remains favorable.
there is but they made a document so large that no two people can read it and come to the same conclusion giving all these special groups tax breaks.
if only there was a flat or fair tax which would close all loop-holes.
a progressive system is not really that complex.
it can be made loophole free as well.
this is why i think the recent usa "alternative minimum tax" was no accident.
credit to the sneaky fuckers who got it in and passed.
here's hoping our crop of morons can do the same.
amt for straya!
there should be some form of alternative minimum tax you mean the illuminati?
because that's *exactly* what you're suggesting.
the reason why this is possible is because there is no world government to say tax havens are illegal.
&gt; the reason why this is possible is because there is no world government to say tax havens are illegal.
world government or not, plenty of things that used to be not illegal are now illegal.
the eu are taking action against it, this article is from two days ago.
no reason australia couldn't adopt something similar.
it's hardly impossible.
https://mobile.nytimes.com/reuters/2017/12/05/business/05reuters-eu-tax-blacklist-taxhaven.html i hate to break it to you, but plenty of eu banks are 100% happy to open accounts for entities in offshore jurisdictions.
some don't even bother with any serious due diligence because who cares, it's profits!
&gt; but plenty of eu banks luckily, the eu is more than banks.
so i am wondering : at which point does this become unfair competition ?
lets say i am a small company producing hardware in kentucky and i have to compete against apple on that market segment... i have to pay taxes and they don't.
thus effectively giving them an unfair financial advantage.
can't i take them to court ?
the eu have fined microsoft for that very reason.
it's why we basically only have google/apple/microsoft to choose from even though the market is clearly profitable.
it's too hard to break into this market.
it's incredibly hard to opt-out of data gathering if you don't have any options.
adam smith's "invisible hand" argument is clearly flawed in this case.
this is so fucking retarded.
adam smith doesn't apply when you've just admitted that the corporations use their unfair tax benefits to price out competition.
that's a visible hand.
it's an accountant's hand, or a lobbyist's hand.
the hand is only invisible because it's fisting everyone.
can't see the hand when its buried in your ass that was my point.
sorry if i was unclear or misunderstanding you ah i see.
my bad.
sorry i went off.
just to let you know, apple doesn't sell user data since they don't make money off ads.
it's in their financial statements.
i do agree that few competitors is a bad thing, though.
i refuse to believe this.
even though they might not but "names to faces", i'm sure they know how many apps get downloaded on a particular device.
i would be interested in some specific sources.
here's a good article about it: https://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-weinstein/apple-vs-google-the-priva_b_5898168.html tim cook's quote: “we sell products.
we don’t build a profile based on your email content or web browsing habits to sell to advertisers....we don’t monetize the information you store...we don’t read your email or messages to get information to market to you.” that's a direct dig at google, who employs all those tactics.
those words have been very carefully chosen.
apple does build a profile of its users and then sells ad placements on their devices based on that profile.
it's just that they don't use personal information like browser history or email to do so.
of course, that means apple's advertisement revenue is far less effective than google's...but advertising is only a side gig for apple, so it's just icing on the cake for them.
in contrast, google's main revenue stream is still advertising (by a massive margin) and they're hugely successful in that market.
their ads have a much higher success rate than competitors because of their detailed user profiles.
an couple other important points here: google doesn't "sell data to clients" in a literal sense - they don't release any user data to other people or companies.
what they sell is their expertise in getting ads in front of the right eyeballs.
pretending that google actually has people reading user emails, looking through location history and showing that data to clients is misleading and utterly false.
the article linked above is an idealistic and very shallow dive from an privacy advocate, seemingly without having much idea of how the world works.
luckily for you it's the small australian owner local businesses getting raped by the taxman, and taking apple to an american court for australian tax unfairness probably would be useless for a kentucky business.
of course ianal.
the example doesn't apply.
- my small business pays 5% lower vat and attracts a discounted rate of corporation tax than a similarly sized business in another sector, for the sole reason that it's a technology company.
- british newspapers are zero rated for vat on sales and subscriptions because they're a declining industry.
- small businesses with turnovers under £300k pay 20% corporation tax, and larger businesses pay only 21%.
in your view these would be examples of unfair competition, but in fact they're examples of government providing economic incentives to help different kinds companies get going.
larger companies need very different kinds of help - the ability to inform (but not dictate) regulation for example.
if microsoft, for example, sells a product in the eu and pays tax on there, when it brings that profit back to the us and is forced to pay the same taxes again, isn't that unfair competition by the same standards you've set?
it's also true that every single one of the methods large corporations use to limit their tax liability are available to small businesses and that small business owners are amongst the worst at literal tax avoidance (actually not declaring takings or hiding income).
&gt; it's also true that every single one of the methods large corporations use to limit their tax liability are available to small businesses no.
fully integrating your production vertically is available to everyone in theory.
but it take hands, and expertise, that a 20ppl company can not have.
tax avoidance in great magnitude requires international companies, comple-ish legal setups, with lawyers/tax specialist to keep watch on laws and lobby, it requires you to be big enough to tell governements to fuck off (or make tax holidays), to have leverage on entire states/sectors of the economy, etc.
it's like the us tax reform "it's totally fair, everyone, whether poor or rich, can deduce the cost of their 200ft yacht from their tax burden" &gt; and that small business owners are amongst the worst at literal tax avoidance (actually not declaring takings or hiding income).
yes.
\#whatabout &gt; tax avoidance they're not avoiding tax, they're limiting their liability.
if we can't get that very simple thing straight then the rest of the discussion is meaningless.
i also say this as a business owner - my company does not need an array of tax lawyers, there are plenty of firms willing to provide the service at a fixed rate.
it might take an army of very smart people to figure out the loophole but once it's established it's easy to exploit en-masse and everyone with any sense does so.
tax loopholes are an arms race not a crossword puzzle.
&gt;yes.
#whatabout because the op was comparing the behavior of small businesses and large one's, so it's not a whataboutism, it's a valid point.
they shouldn't be allowed to limit their liability.
i work for a large company that for some reason doesn't know how to dodge taxes, and yeah it is actually a massive problem.
how can we compete properly when our competitor doesn't need to pay tax?
&gt; i have to compete against apple...i have to pay taxes and they don't.
apple pays about $10b/yr in income taxes, fyi.
https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/06/apple-secretly-moved-jersey-ireland-tax-row-paradise-papers apple payed around 5% in taxes overseas due to taxhavens.
they're now forced to pay ireland iirc.
you should read the above article if you haven't.
from the article: &gt;documents in the paradise papers show how apple began to consider its options in 2014 following criticism of the way it was doing business through ireland.
a year earlier, a bipartisan us senate committee had pilloried the company for seeking “the holy grail of tax avoidance”.
it highlighted practices that had saved apple from paying billions of dollars over decades.
"they pay taxes, but not as much as i'd like" is very different than "they don't pay taxes".
"but not as much as they owe" they pay every penny they owe.
do you really think the tax man has any sense of humour at all about late taxes?
every penny they technically owe.
the tax havens are technically legal, but not in the spirit of the law.
but what about on their profits?
everyone pays income tax.
corporations only pay income tax on their profits.
business taxes work a bit differently than individual taxes in that regard - individuals pay taxes on income(and get exemptions to pay for basic living costs), businesses pay taxes on profits, and usually get no such basic exemptions.
meanwhile the cost of living in australia is through the roof.
housing markets fucked.
health insurance is a rort.
fuels fucked.
powers fucked.. and the gov happily spends hundreds of millions on postal surveys and stadiums.
shits whack!
you're just fucking scratching the surface here mate.
privatisation of the electricity market, for example, has the 'retailer arm' in victoria, which does literally nothing in the delivery of electricity absorb around 15% of total revenue spent on electricity... think about that for a second.
this was a segment of the economy generated entirely out of privatisation legislation, in order to demonstrate that the free market 'runs things more efficiently'.
it does literally nothing.
and 15% of every powerbill in victoria goes to it's shareholders.
but of course the increase in power prices is because they 'shut down coal power plants'.
which they were incentivised to shut down by the liberal government... holy shit.
you could change australia to canada and everything you said, word for word is what's happening now.
this is almost everywhere.
the rise of huge international business has put them on the level of governments.
they buy politicians and write laws.
as long as money equals power this issue will remain welcome to the corporate world.
where fucking the 99% is legal and status quo.
there was a post recently talking about what american legislation is doing, they called it asset stripping.
it's where you sell off long term revenue generators/investments in order to have liquid cash now.
privatizing utilities (things which are known to be natural monopolies and are considered the most dangerous area to be given to private control) is exactly that.
making the budget look good this year and sell off a revenue stream for the future.
you can add a few bits to the uk too.
we're internationally fucked.
yep... there is one and only one electricity provider in tasmania for example.
don't get me wrong, australia's a fantastic place to live, but fuck me there are some issues too.
&gt; which does literally nothing in the delivery of electricity absorb around 15% of total revenue spent on electricity... i suspect a lot of privatization is implemented in such a way as to create some number of meaningless jobs, since the govt doesn't want to be as big of an employer anymore, and they don't want privatization to suddenly swell the ranks of people on welfare (at least not too much).
the basic fact of the matter is that human labour is becoming increasingly less meaningful, and we're basically unable to directly address the issue in a collective way, because nobody wants to risk their image and their political career (or even their positions in a private sector) by just calling a spade a fucking spade, by admitting that automation and globalization are destroying jobs faster than creating meaningful ones.
some murmurs of a basic income pop up here and there, but nobody really has a plan to pitch to the general populace...but of course, neither do i, and holy shit, i can't even imagine what that plan could look like in it's details.
myself, i'm just trying to stay as self-contained in my life as possible, and teaching myself some skills that enable much of this new technology, in areas that aren't easy to master...i hope it pays off.
does this "retailer arm" own the power lines?
if so, trust me, they do something - infrastructure maintenance isn't cheap.
no, this was part of the deamalgamation and privatisation.
because "privatisation" and "competition" makes things cheaper, right?
privatization of the electricity market happened in the us and they are heavily regulated by making it a utility.
something needs to be done worldwide when it comes to housing.
right now we either have to pay ridiculous amounts just have our own homes or risk being homeless.
it's not like we can just squat wherever in 2017. it doesn't make sense, it feels like extortion.
(i'm talking about the cost of land mainly, something that should belong to the population anyway) which part of the population?
i'm sure a lot of people would love to live in manhattan or the city of london, but there's not enough housing for all of them to do so, which means it needs to be distributed somehow.
(also, if you want to live cheap, go to places other people don't want to live.
you can get a house in detroit for pocket change.)
do detroit even have water?
are you advocating for a society where we separate the rich from the poor?
should poor people live in cities that are falling apart and rich people live in separate cities with good facilities?
i'm not talking about manhattan, the article is about australia.
downtown sydney or melbourne then.
it's the same idea, i'm just picking examples people would know anywhere in the world.
you have more people who want to live in desirable areas than you have housing in those areas.
that needs to be rationed somehow, and usually we ration things by money in society.
money has the advantage that it gives people a reason to fix shortages - if housing is pricey, you have a reason to build more, which fixes the shortage.
most other rationing systems don't fix shortages, they make them worse.
and yes, detroit has water.
they'll cut you off for non-payment, but that's like every other service provider on the planet.
(you might be thinking of flint, which is nearby and has major water quality problems) you know why those areas are cheap?
because there isn't a lot of work compared to the 'expensive' areas.
so you are advertising for kicking out the working population from areas with a lot of work so they can live cheap only to have them drive towards the city in massive swarms.
it wont solve anything since they will be forced to spend a shitload of time and money on getting to their jobs.
besides the most healthiest and happiest cities in the world are cities where poor and rich live relatively close together, so social housing not clustered together but scattered in small amounts throughout cities is the best way of solving the housing problem.
some.
some are cheap because the local government has pro-supply housing policy.
some are cheap because the job market is good in one field and bad in others(e.g., my wife could get a job in a heartbeat in wichita, kansas, which is extremely cheap, because she's in the same field that it specializes in, but i'd be screwed trying to work there).
i do agree with integrating housing between social groups when possible - it works much better than isolated projects.
but i want to see a shitload of buildings going up in any city that's complaining about high rents too, because that's the only thing that could actually fix the problem.
australia is not the us.
the divide between rural and metro is far more stark in australia.
the choices for housing are ) very expensive in areas with jobs or b) moderately expensive with no jobs.
i have a feeling you're severely underestimating the price of housing in australia.
i live outside of a regional city 90 minutes away from sydney and a 2 bedroom asbestos shit hole next door to me is going for 820,000 aud.
zoning is causing a housing epidemic.
it has artificially choked the housing supply in cities around the word.
the problem is becoming very exacerbated now that a lot of people are moving back into the city.
negative gearing cops a lot of blame for the inflated house prices in australia.
it's basically a tax incentive for people to own investment properties.
yea it's not like renting exists.
had to look up "rort" but what about the crocodile attacks every 3 months!
&gt; meanwhile the cost of living in australia is through the roof.
that's true everywhere in the west.
globally the development over the past decades is the the very poorest get a little bit less poor, the very richest get a lot more rich, and the middle class is being squeezed.
the worst part is that the massive company i work for actually paid an insanely high tax bill this year.
so it's not even all companies doing it, but instead just some shitty companies ruining it for the rest of us.
these stories have largely been forgotten or ignored because of the gay marriage survey, debate and passing, which was the point; to make people not notice this stuff.
they learned from kevin spacey.
he learned from these governments.
he just used it off-screen.
i love how it says their fair share as if it’s going to put a little bit more money in the piggy bank.
with the amount of tax skipped by all these massive companies the government would probably be closer to the black.
this shit is why we can have high taxes and still have problem properly funding government programs.
the problem isn't with the size of the programs, it's with the level of tax dodging.
the people and corporations who would pay the most taxes are the ones with the most tools to dodge them, and the small corporations and middle class end up on the receiving end because they have less means to avoid paying.
so remove the idiotic corporate tax and shift the tax burden to income.
you can't easily avoid income tax.
if you are careful about counting every advantage paid by a corporation as income (and not just salary), it could work, yes.
corporations aren't people, no matter how convenient it is for their owners.
well yeah, the point is in the end, all profits from corps will eventually be reinvested (go to workers or employees of another company) or be paid out as dividends.
all of which is income.
are you arguing for trickle-down economy?
no i’m arguing against the corporate tax and instead shifting it to income tax.
from an economics point of view corporate taxes hurt small businesses most.
nothing i said has anything to do with trickle down.
never tax on income when it comes to high net worth people or profitable mega companies.
what?
i don't get what you are saying.
he means that you tax on costs - businesses can hide their income within themselves easier than they can hide their costs.
this is the best tl;dr i could make, [original](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/07/australian-tax-office-says-36-of-big-firms-and-multinationals-paid-no-tax) reduced by 84%.
(i'm a bot) ***** &gt; the tax office has revealed 36% of the largest public companies and multinational entities in australia paid no tax in the most recent financial year on record.
&gt; it says while the majority of entities in the data made profits and paid tax in 2015-16, sensitivity to economic conditions, reinvestment back into the business, distribution of profits to other entities within the broader group, tax deductions and tax offsets could affect the amount of taxable income and tax payable for each entity.
&gt; of the 1,073 foreign-owned entities covered in the report, comprising over half of the corporate entities involved, they accounted for one-quarter of tax payable, while australian public entities accounted for just 30% of the corporate entities covered but accounted for 69% of the tax payable.

because the firm's don't actively seek out/lobby for every loophole they can.
it's a team effort.
i always crack up in hysteria when i remember how some one can acknowledge that business has an interest in influencing the government and somehow think that the idea of making the government more powerful is somehow going to make business less interested or capable in purchasing that power.
&gt;because the firm's don't actively seek out/lobby for every loophole they can did you list your charitable donations on your tax return?
if so then you are just as bad as these evil corporations - using all legal means to reduce your tax burden.
that's not even close to what he said.
it would be more like: did you have charitable donations that weren't allowed to be deducted, so you hired a lobbying firm to have the government change the law to include your charitable donations as deductible?
if so you are just as bad as these corporations.
deducting charitable donations is nothing like selling yourself your own property at an inflated price to make it seem like you've lost money rather than made money.
and even then, the charitable deductions actually help someone, most of the financial tricks these firms use make them keep all the money for themselves.
and their shareholders.
regular people do that quite often, actually.
they're not as organized as big companies, but anyone who agitates for a tax break is doing exactly this, or anyone who agitates for a subsidy or tax credit that'd help them.
and normal people vote for those policies all the time.
also, in practice there's a lot more moderately large firms than any legislator could ever hope to pander to, even if they wanted to try.
lobbying can succeed sometimes, but it can't possibly be as strong as people suggest - politicians would have no time to kiss babies or sit in interminable committee meetings and make fools of themselves if it was.
we don’t pay the politicians to maintain the loopholes and industry subsidies/tax cuts.
&gt; if so then you are just as bad as these evil corporations charitable donations at least go towards helping people in need as oppossed to increasing a companies net earnings to pay out as dividends or buy back shares.
both actions which mainly benefit the wealthy and rich what about contributing to your retirement savings?
rich people get more from that than poor people in most countries, and none of it goes to charity.
you seem pretty clueless - more what is going on is that companies set up companies in countries with no taxes right like the caymans - and then you pass all your income through that "overseas" entity so the profits are not "domestic" and then you put the money in your domestic bank accounts because those other banks are crazy expensive and/or shady - so in reality you make no domestic income and pay no income taxes - but benefit from all the protections afforded by the government.
imagine white knighting for multinational tax dodgers.
jfc.
also no i don't and i'm still paying tax if i do you stooge.
i'm actually having trouble understanding why a person would even bother posting in their defence.
what did you hope to achieve here?
same thing we get out of "white knighting for al qaeda" when the 9/11 truthers come out.
it's not that they're good people, it's that your conspiracy theories are stupid and damage your ability to actually understand how the world works, and that kind of stupidity has real-world effects.
it's hard enough to make good tax policy in the first place, even before some fools start talking about how politicians are all corrupt jerks just because [they're trying to close loopholes after they got their start at a tax planning firm](https://thewalrus.ca/bill-morneau-may-be-rich-that-doesnt-make-him-corrupt/).
i dont really know where you're coming from.
what have conspiracy theories got to do with multinationals demonstrably avoiding taxes and lobbying politicians?
i'm replying to people saying these companies are blameless.
the companies don't give a fuck about you, why leap to their defense?
fuck them and any system that supports them.
corporations minimize taxes within the confines of existing tax laws, and lobby governments, but the same is true of everyone who goes to an accountant for their taxes and gave $20 to their local "taxpayer's federation".
corporations are bigger and more noticeable, but they don't have nearly as much impact on governance as people think.
i work in tax planning, and i know a lot of people in a wide range of government offices, political roles, and lobbyist roles - it just doesn't work that way.
companies aren't blameless, per se, but they have vastly less of the blame than governments do.
companies can't give themselves tax breaks, and they can't literally buy and sell politicians.
all they can do is argue their case, like everyone else, and they lose more often than they win.
you're looking at the system and calling it a giant mass of corruption, but it mostly isn't.
i know you don't believe me, but then i know people who don't believe me when i say that we've walked on the moon either.
i'm still right, and you're still trying to blame nefarious forces for things you don't understand.
&gt;companies can't give themselves taxbreaks, and they can't literally buy and sell politicians have you ever heard of the us?
it's pretty clear that lobbying and campaign donations have an effect on legislation.
no they can't *literally buy and sell them* but the result is more or less the same.
i don't know how it works in australia but i doubt the article would exist if there wasn't a problem.
"i'm still right" huh?
i think you have a vastly different worldview than the rest of us.
if you're benefitting under the current system then i understand why you're defending it the funny thing is that a) the us is less corrupt than many other first-world countries(never mind the poorer ones), and b) donations don't actually help politicians win.
they're selling themselves for nothing.
(nobody ever said they were smart, i suppose...) fwiw, i'm a middle income earner(my family's income this year is roughly the median for households in my city), and i have no meaningful investment assets for the time being.
this isn't a self-interest argument.
i work in financial planning and i see the tax code up close - it's not what people think it is, and even very smart people sometimes say truly dumb things when they talk about it.
it bothers me, no more and no less.
&gt;you're looking at the system and calling it a giant mass of corruption, but it mostly isn't.
no i'm not.
i'm saying these companies do dodgy shit to avoid taxes and you're saying we aren't allowed to be upset about it.
fuck that noise.
i only replied to the other dude because he was trying deflect blame away from them.
&gt;i'm still right, and you're still trying to blame nefarious forces for things you don't understand.
jesus fucking christ get over yourself.
what i don't understand is this culture of excusing shitty company behaviour and telling others they can't be upset either.
it's both... the firms are scumbags and the government is to slow to block loopholes.
block loopholes?
what?
not our government.
they put those loopholes there on purpose and were paid plenty to make it happen by corporations.
they aren't removing them unless they're at gun point.
how?
don't just fucking downvote, nobody in this thread *including me* knows what exactly the issue is with taxation law, and you're all just blindly jacking each other off instead of having a discussion.
it's the task of the government to, you know, govern.
i've never seen a comment that doesn't even attempt to answer the question get so many upvotes.
what is it that you think the government should be doing in this instance that they are not currently doing?
**govern** ˈɡʌv(ə)n/ *verb* 1. conduct the policy, actions, and affairs of (a state, organization, or people) with authority the government ought to do that.
if so many of these corporations are (apparently legally) making vast profits and paying virtually no tax, and that is detrimental to the interests of rest of the nation (**hint: it is**), then the government ain't "governing", pure and simple.
it's their role, their raison d'etre, their purpose in existence and they ain't doing it.
their job is to enact policy in the interest of their constituents.
so they need to make sure corporations are taxed.
i don't know specifically how either.
but that seems to me to be somewhat beside the point.
it isn't my job.
pretty simple.
you can hardly blame people for using all existing options.
or, you can, but there is not much point.
people will always do whats best for them unless there are rules against it with enough punishment to reinforce them.
its the job of the society and therefore the government to set those rules properly and punish breaking these rules sufficiently.
we should blame all the people responsible when a system gets abused for profit.
a system where people are essentially getting payed without doing any kind of labor whatsoever and get away with not paying taxes is not a healthy, sustainable system.
claiming "it's the governments fault" might be true but no one forces big corps to use loopholes.
just because something is technically legal doesn't mean that it's the right thing to do.
it's just a cop out.
you can always argue what is the good thing to do and what not, but any morale is only as good as it is enforced.
humans are not inherently moral creatures (or at least not further as "thou shall not kill"), so any moral that goes against their individual advantages needs to be enforced.
if you set up a guideline that prevents people from doing what's best for them and allow everyone to just ignore them, don't wonder if they do.
of course, you are also right that its all peoples responsibility to enforce moral guidelines, especially in a democracy were everyone has (some) political influence.
but the way for a society to change the rules is through its government.
edit: the cop-out is rather "its those big corps fault!"
because you put the blame on the thing that cannot be changed.
you will not just magically get "good" humans in all leading positions, especially if being "good" is a disadvantage.
the one thing that can be changed is the rules by which everyone tries to get advantages for themselves aka the laws.
and it is our responsibility to put politcal pressure on our governments to adjust those such that such abuse is no longer possible.
don't just chicken out of that responsibility by blaming "evil corps".
&gt;humans are not inherently moral creatures i disagree.
if there weren't any laws against theft i still wouldn't steal.
if there weren't any laws against rape i still wouldn't rape.
people help others all the time without being forced or because they're legally obligated to do so.
the problem today is that bad behavior increases the odds for profit, of course it's easier to be immoral but that doesn't mean you're free of blame when acting immoral just because certain aspects aren't illegal.
don't conflate ethics and morality with law.
edit to repond to your edit: people should pressure their governments, i'm all for that, but that doesn't exonerate the corporations for using these practices.
people should be responsible for their own actions, should they not?
if someone behaves like an ass that's entirely legal in most cases but it's hardly something we should encourage and excuse because of legality.
the two aren't mutually exclusive like you paint it out to be.
&gt;no one forces them to you have no idea how corporations work.
if they did not use every available legal method to maximize profit they could be sued by their shareholders how so?
so it's not a murderer's fault, it's the government who has to prevent it?
no blame for those making unethical choices?
what a terrible argument.
i saw similar arguments on the thread about apple's tax evasion following the paradise papers revelations.
in that thread the person with similar arguments finally ended up defending apple by saying "they followed the law so well they managed to make even more money!"
there's usually a reason why someone would take the corporations side on a thread about major tax evasion.
regular people have no reason to support these practices since they're still forced to pay their taxes.
so do you agree we can hardly blame a murderer if technically the law allows it?
really, hardly blame?
because someone else screwed up some completely unrelated legal job?
tax avoidance is largely legal.
in case of murder, there are obviously laws in place that make it illegal.
the guilt of the crime is on the murderer and, given that the jurisdiction works properly, he will be punished for that crime.
there are still two things to consider: first, its still the governments responsibility that the murderer gets his punishment second, you would of course prefer that the murder never happend.
thats why there is a concept of crime prevention.
when the murder happend, that crime prevention has failed!
the responsibility for this crime prevention is not on the murderer, because that would be absurd.
he has obviously no interest in the prevention of his own crime and putting this responsibility on him just sets the prevention up for a sure failure!
this responsibility is therefore on the full society (you don't want to live in a state were only the government is responsible for crime prevention) and while you cannot expect perfect prevention, one should not end the discussion on how the society can prevent crimes better with "its the murderers fault!".
a person will always be able to murder regardless of any prevention unless he's physically unable to do so.
i'm not following your logic.
i'm also not sure why you're so dedicated to shifting blame on society as a whole while claiming we shouldn't blame the corporations for their actions.
do you have a vested interest in this?
first off, legality was not the issue.
something can be legal and you'd still consider it harmful/unethical/whatever.
secondly, and most importantly, the blame for preventing a murder does rest on the murderer, since it's their decision that caused the murder.
had they exercised some self-control rather than, say, killing someone because they feel like it or think they'll get away, society wouldn't have as much crime to prevent.
your mentality when deciding to take advantage of a legal loophole does matter because it affects other people.
selfishness shpuld not be incentivised.
it is up to the government to set the rules of the game.
all firms are doing is following those rules.
no firm is going to make themselves less competitive and reduce shareholder value by paying more tax than necessary.
95% of us individuals would do the same if we had the opportunity.
you're still responsible for how you decide to act within the rules.
just because something is allowed in the rules doesn't mean it's right or good.
also speak for yourself on the 95%.
i don't decide on what i do based solely on whether or not it's technically allowed, that's fucking disgusting... edit: typos neither do i, but good luck to those who are willingly paying more taxes than they could.
thats just not me.
source on that 95% statistic?
don't throw stats around if you can't back them up.
you get my point.
true but reddit is full of people claiming they know what "95% of the population would do".
speaking for others with certainty without being able to back it up is something i'm against on principle.
&gt; you can hardly blame people for using all existing options.
one of those 'options' is to help one of your cronies get elected.
you can't hide behind the rules when you help write them.
&gt; people will always do whats best for them if thats true of everyone then its hopeless.
anyone you could get to be in government will be corrupt; garbage in garbage out &gt; one of those 'options' is to help one of your cronies get elected.
you can't hide behind the rules when you help write them.
its also a flaw in the system that this is an option and it will only get better once rules against them are in place and these rules are properly enforced.
&gt; if thats true of everyone then its hopeless.
anyone you could get to be in government will be corrupt; garbage in garbage out thats how it is.
there is a reason we say that power corrupts.
its not quite as hopeless though.
if we enforce our rules against corruption properly (and toughen them where needed) we can reach a situation were its not beneficial for governments to be corrupt, and thats the only way to get a decent government.
but its on us to keep this pressure up.
&gt; if we enforce our rules against corruption properly who is we, the people that you think are out to screw everyone?
the rules are lax on purpose.
there is no set of rules that won't be junk unless you find people who aren't trying to make junk rules just going by your outlook, the cops, the politicians, everyone, is trying to get 1 over on you.
how can such a system possibly work *to clarify, i am not saying 'just trust people' is the way to go, but you are the one advocating that corporations get a free pass for the shady shit they pull &gt; who is we, the people that you think are out to screw everyone we are the people.
the difference is that the best for us on average is not what is the best for each one as an individual.
and since we as individuals do not have the power to achieve what is best for us, individually egoistical actions are not the optimal way for us.
we have to work together and aim for our common goals since that is the best what each of us can achieve.
and the best for all of us is distributed power (aka democracy) and if everyone is forced to do his part towards common interests (aka paying taxes).
in fuctioning western countries, most cops have to fear consquences if they abuse their power and therefore mostly don't abuse their power.
because the system works there!
in a country without working systems ... well, go to an afghani prison and see if the cops try to get 1 over on you.
hint: they will!
the same is obviously for politicans.
unless there is some expectations to get caught, they will more and more corrupt ones will get into power.
because being corrupt is an advantage in politics unless you get caught.
the people using these options are the same people fucking creating these options through lobbyists.
they create the exploitable system with bribe money so they can exploit it to get more money.
saying that these exploiters are blameless is a certain way to ensure the problem will *only* get worse.
no, putting the blame on those that use the brocken system instead of those that made and can change this brocken system is making what makes very sure this system never changes!
fuck rich people jesus this is the reason for inequality and growing poverty.... well why are they stating that they are targeting small business?
here is your issue ato, chase the big guys and leave small business owners alone.
because large businesses are likely performing tax avoidance, which is legal.
going after them is often a waste of time and money.
enough public pressure causes governments to take action, "going after them" (in a non-violent way ofc) is exactly what we should do.
small businesses commit more illegal tax avoidance (cash payments, hiding income).
the big companies are forced to do it legally.
welcome to whose taxes is it anyway!
i am your host drew and this is the show where we dodge all responsibility!
let's get to our first game of the night called "which island did the profits go to?"
but yet they come after the middle class with audits ah yes australia.
trying to be more like the usa during its decline.
dont act all innocent, you gave us rupert murdoch.
the loopholes will only be fixed when individuals and small/medium local businesses start shifting their earnings overseas for tax avoidance as well.
how has no one created a scaled platform for individual incorporation and smb's to shift earnings overseas?
it can't be that complicated.
incorporate a shell company in a low-tax jurisdiction, run your supply chain purchases through the shell, while charging your domestic arm near-retail so all profit is earned by the shell company?
doesn't seem that hard.
clearly you don't have to physically ship merchandise through the low-tax jurisdiction, not every iphone goes to ireland.
ehm no, that would just result in even less taxes being payed.
ban the use of tax havens instead.
you say: less taxes being payed [by individuals and small/medium local businesses].
i hear: greater motivation for government to eliminate tax avoidance schemes for all tax paying entities and a more equitable tax regime for all.
is this a problem for australia?
if so, does it suggest australia should do something to revise their tax laws and treaties?
let me guess, conservatives.. the solution is to remove literally vital services from the most vulnerable in society?
fix this.
government debt solved.
change the corporate tax rate to a percentage of turnover.
not profits.
the corporations here write the tax laws.
we, just like america, live in a plutocracy.
australia is a special place.
in the us we tax them higher and if you have the money you can dodge but only a few companies have the ability to dodge taxes.
that would work great if every company sold the same product in the same industry with the same profit margins, overheads and financial costs.
otherwise you're asking low margin industries (think fmcg) to foot a ridiculously disproportionate amount of the tax burden.
so destroy all low margin industries?
annihilate everyone during recessions?
do you understand basic finance?
christ no wonder we are fucked when we have people like you saying “see simple solution, problem solved” to complex problems.
do some research for christ’s sake.try to understand why things are the way they are before you go off spouting idiotic, economy destroying ideas &gt; so destroy all low margin industries?
if they'd be low margin industries they, their owners and financiers would not have billions upon billions stashed in tax havens.
do.. do you understand what low margin means?
low margin means that you only make a small percentage of revenue as profit.
but if your revenue is very high, you still make tons of profit.
low margin businesses just involve high volume.
seriously, take a bloody finance course before you spout bollocks.
walmart has a 3% profit margin.
but it's the biggest company in the world.
margin is a metric based on industry, not size.
&gt; but if your revenue is very high, you still make tons of profit.
profit is after subtraction of big payouts to owners and financiers.
so the margin is actually larger than it seems.
also the profit can be reduced without destroying the corporation or industry.
well now we should see the data indicate that everyone in australia got paid more in wages and experienced overall economic growth.
without the pesky government taxing the corporations money they can finally invest in their firms!
a rising tide lifts all boats!
not sure if you're being sarcastic or not.
(using the /s tag helps) trickle down economy has been thoroughly debunked, income inequality is clearly getting worse.
i am being sarcastic.
but there isn't much funny about it.
the same corporations and individuals who are receiving the bulk of the upcoming american tax break have already acknowledged that they will not be using the money to primarily hire new workers or raise wages.
they will keep doing the same thing they have been doing already with the huge profits they have - raising executive compensation and buying back stocks.
but it isn't really about growing the economy, because if it was we would cut middle class taxes and fully finance services.
trickle down economics is about justice and liberty, being able to keep whats yours and not have thw government tell you what to do with it.
the fact that giving $100 to a wealthy person trickles down to a $1 raise for an employee is just a nice, convenient side effect.
this seems like about the number i'd expect, especially in a year where resource prices dropped sharply.
there's always companies losing money, and there's various tax breaks that governments offer which companies will take advantage of.
i've seen similar stories from other countries, and when you dig into them, they never amount to much.
i work in tax planning in canada, and if a corporation is avoiding taxes here, it's because they genuinely don't owe any, and usually for good and just reasons.
the tax agencies aren't stupid.
(i'm not saying that all loopholes have been closed, or that the tax system is perfect.
but it's not nearly as bad as these stories tend to make it look.)
tax accountants aren't cheap.
correction, good tax accountants aren't cheap.
i can point you in the direction of a couple of nice cheap ones who i predict will be behind bars in a few years.
is that good, bad, or irrelevant?
repeat after me; we live in a just and fair society quick, cut pensions more!
not to take away from the importance of big business tax avoidance, energy and resources have been in the red for a few years, of course they wouldn't have a tax payable position.... they have carried forward tax losses to offset the recent uptick but remember, we need to cut taxes to give them money to reinvest.
(to be fair, that may help those left paying *something*, but i suspect that the 36% cited still represents a ton of lost revenue that can't be given to schools, roads, etc.
send the u.s. all your big firms and companies, australia... here they pay no taxes.
so create a simple tax system with lower rates, then all parties will pay taxes and it won't only punish the medium/small businesses.
honestly this is just the byproduct of an overly complicated tax code.
when we try to whittle out little exceptions here and there we end up opening legal avenues for entity's to take advantage of and who can blame them?
if you could legally be exempted from paying taxes by paying an attorney 25% of what they normally cost wouldn't you?
did they find that the no-tax they paid trickled down to the workers as increased wages?
(didnt think so) god their going to hate bitcoin then arnt they..... will you aussies be upset if i refer to you as little america?
yes but only because i'd prefer "average america".
i *understand*.
only if you don't get upset when i call you a seppo i would only be confused since i don't understand the reference.
could you please explain it?
just an fyi, corporations don't pay taxes.
we pay their taxes in the form of increased prices.
a tax is just an added cost that is factored into how much they have to charge for the product or service you buy.
so, when you demand that large corporations pay more in taxes; don't be surprised when your starbucks, apple and whole foods products now cost more.
someone have to pay taxes.
so they taxed more every cup of coffee and small café.
starbucks pays nothing on their *profit* and making rich people richer.
not stuff cheaper.
contrary.
no, my point is that raising the corporate tax rate will increase the cost of products they sell because they will have to increase the cost of the product to maintain profitability.
the company is not in the business of providing you a product as much as it is to make money.
your goal in going to work everyday is not to make some widget or provide some service; it is to make enough money to live your life.
if you reduce costs to the company by reducing corporate taxes, you may or may not see that in a reduced cost of the product.
but you can be sure to see and increase in the cost to you if their taxes go up.
you have never taken a first year economics course.
a tax is partially absorbed by the consumers, but it's also partially absorbed by owners.
keep telling yourself that.
companies are in it to make money and pass on all the costs to the consumers.
they might take less in profit in order to stay in business but the end goal is to make as much money as possible while providing the product as cheaply as possible.
for the company to "absorb" the cost, that means operating at a loss.
you can only do that if you are going to make the money back later (amazon successfully did this to secure themselves as the online retail business and are now worth billions).
making less money but still making a profit means you successfully covered all the costs of making and selling your product (including paying your taxes).
what you are saying is merely semantics and not what happens in actuality.
lol no.
economics class only teach the ideal scenario, not the real world one on paper, this works.
in the real world, filled with imperfect humans and especially human power interests, it is never so simple.
illegally?
because if not, fuck off.
you're pointing at the wrong people.
don't hate the players that rigged the game, hate the game!
oh, so i have to be perfectly fine with everything that isn't illegal?
it is a joke.
taxation is theft
i'm not sure if the nations of europe will give up all their independence to become a single nation.
that seems pretty unlikely to me without an external threat like war or economic isolation.
with the rise in nationalism around the world, it seems even more unlikely.
i fully agree and especially not by 2025. at some point in the future a united europe might be the best choice for it to stay relevant in the world but i don't think i'll witness it myself and i'm 28 right now.
i would think there will newer be a rash "united states of europe decision".
rather just as now it will be step by step.
let's work more closely on this, let's work more closely on that, let's harmonize this and that.
let's start shared european entity for this etc.
in the end one would probably end up looking the steps and ask?
exactly at what point we stopped being **union** and became **federation**?
and do we even care about the distinction of everybody agreed and the setup works?
because even such thing as "federal state" is not exactly unitarily clearly well defined.
there is pretty much as many federal setups as there are federations.
all with their own quirks and nuances.
i would say eu already in many ways is federal states of europe.
it has federal legislature: bicamerals european parliament and european union council, federal judiciary european court of justice, federal executive the european union commission.
it acts as a combined state in many issues such as trade etc.
so really it is more of a matter of terminology etc.
what i care more about as european union citizen (see federal citizenship also) is the subject matters in themselves and practical reality.
whatever this is called or categorized as is it democratically governed, does it have clearly defined fair legal framework, is it beneficial to us, does it work on day to day level etc.
i dont care what label one puts on it as long as it works.
and as much as it is slow sometimes and has its quirks and dissapointment to me as both finnish and european union citizen it is worth the hassle, the member fees etc.
overall it has been positive in my opinion.
it is worth all the effort, trouble and cost.
and when there is problems, one ought to aim to fix those.
nothing is perfect, specially humans and human civilizations.
nobody promised trouble free world to us.
governing, diplomacy or politics is not degreed by law of nature to be easy.
but atleast we are currently trying to solve our problems with bureaucracy and talking instead of the prior centuries of killing the hell out of each other.
just an unified fiscal and work wages framework would do wonders for a true united federation of europe, but yes , i agree with your forecast.
another major factor would be having the eu as a complete legal entity inside the un, instead of just observer status.
(which would mean it gets a seat at the security council aswell iirc).
would france have to give up theirs?
yeah i don't see why there is pressure to unify europe as one country like the usa is.
the usa started out unified, you guys have been separate countries for centuries.
i think the union you guys already have is great, you can be individual countries but also united in effort.
the us didn’t really start out that unified, states used to be considered nearly countries in their own right but over time it centralized.
&gt; the usa started out unified no, we started out much like the eu.
in fact under the articles of confederation and perpetual union the central government was much weaker than the eu's is today, other than the ability to field an army, which the states refused to actually pay for.
it was the united states since 1776. where do you get the idea it wasn't a union?
&gt;it was the united states since 1776. same name, different constitution.
the current one came into effect in march 1789.
&gt;where do you get the idea it wasn't a union?
where did you get the idea that i didn't think it was a union?
it was a union of sovereign states, just like the eu, but with less power.
in the name only i also think a united european nation would be great for all of us europeans, but that - even if strived for by all countries - is not going to happen within the next couple of decades for sure.
it has been the best choice for a long time.
every day we delay is a day we fall behind.
the nationalism in europe is mostly aimed against immigrants that comes from outside europe.
in my country people don't mind at all immigrants from other european countries, but immigrants from outside europe?
thats different thing entirely.
odd, in germany there are still issues between the old east and west and where federal money goes and who is getting jobs and at what pay rate.
and that is not even talking different countries.
http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/archives/eb/eb81/eb81_publ_en.pdf go to page 152. there is actually quite a lot of support to develop the eu into a federation.
in hungary, poland, romania, greece, belgium, portugal, croatia, lithuania, france, slovenia, malta, cyprus, germany, italy, spain, latvia, and bulgaria, there are more people who are for a federal eu than against it.
slovakia, czech republic, austria, ireland, luxembourg, netherlands, estonia, denmark, finland, and sweden have more people that are against than for it.
that's 17 countries who tend to be for it and 10 who are against it.
luxemburg is probably against it because they would lose their point of existence (as a tax haven) same for ireland and the netherlands.
ireland and the netherlands are not tax heavens.
the "dutch irish sandwitch" has been used to evade taxes but that loophole is being plugged.
to say the netherlands are "just a tax haven" is to say switzerland is "just a tax haven"... sure, they have smaller taxes than the rest of the eu, but still pretty high compared to the us, canada, new zeland, australia and any "real" tax heaven.
netherland, for hundreds of years, was a world economic and military power and is still the country with some of the greatest thinkers of the modern world.
i it hosts some of the best universities, r&amp;d companies of europe.
(fun fact) it's the biggest agricultural exporter in europe and the biggest exporter of agronomic technology in europe and has one of the highest densities of ipo per capita in the world... oh, and it happens to be one of the centers of medical research of europe as well.
not to mention they have, arguably, the most progressive culture out of any european country.
so if food, technology, science, medicine and the dutch culture in general are irrelevant to you it's "just a tax haven".
the netherlands has pretty strong reasons to not want a federation just because how much an eu criminal law would fuck up the daily lives of it's residents.
tl;dr netherland is small but also one of the biggest reasons why you currently have the food you stuff your face with and the antibiotics that help you not die in order to enjoy more of it.
so fuck you for calling one of the most awesome countries in the world a "just a tax heaven" ireland is the tech world's euro tax haven.
apple is most notable.
ireland has been used by some companies for tax evasion reasons (which is a loophole in their tax system which is now patched), but most companies are in ireland due to the fact that it's a reasonably decent country to do business.
personally i've worked for companies in ireland that don't turn a penny in profits yet but are there because of the regulations, or lack thereof, since you don't have to hire a notary, a lawyer and an accountant to run or start a company.
however ireland is a debatable case.
the netherlands isn't, i don't want to imagine a europe without the netherlands, it's probably one of the countries that has had the most net beneficial influences upon the world in the last hundred of years and has and will pay a pivotal role in the shaping of our species.
calling it " just a tax heaven" is insulting... and their taxes can be quite high actually.
importantly, this survey was from 2014, before the migrant crisis hit.
some of those countries have since elected right-wing nationalist parties who campaigned on promises to reject migrant quotas and fight further eu integration.
i'd be interested to see what the results would be in a more recent survey.
but also before trump, ukraine, brexit, turkey, the beginnings of eu economic recovery and mh17.
really the only countries they need to actually do it are germany and france.
it doesn't work that why, if germany and france decide to create the "use" while everyone else is against it the other nations will just not join.
you would need to conquer them... &gt; conquer them... that reminds me of two individuals who dreamed of very different kinds of east asian union about 100 years ago, and their ideas were so different that one of them shot the other.
the person who shot was an jung-geun, a korean independence activist.
he's revered as one of the national heroes in korea and his dream of asian unity was something like european union of today.
the person who got shot and died was ito hirobumi.
this guy ito is in one of the japanese banknotes, obviously revered as a hero of modernization in japan.
his idea of asian unity was japan taking over east asia.
no wonder he got shot.
i meant that as them being the 'core' eu countries.
of course they need other states, it just doesn't matter which ones as long as germany and france are two of them.
so essentially, the new york and california of the use.
the real question is, who is texas?
poland is most definitely our "bible belt" i think it was the uk but we kinda fucked that up... italy maybe?
that's a funny thought, actually.
maybe the uk leaving was actually one of the biggest steps towards a united states of europe, since you were the largest and most economically developed opponent.
us nordics.
but germany and france being the more important cuntries in the union, they most probably would act as a center of atraction, due to their political, diplomatic and economical influence and importance inside europe.
if france is on board, countries like italy, spain and portugal most probably would be also on board, due to economic and cultural links.
if germany is on board, the same would probably happen with many central european countries, even more considering that as said in other comments, public opinion in many countries supports a federal europe.
also, a federal model allows for a lot of options, so the level of autonomy every state would have is something that would be discussed in this scenario, so it doesn't mean necessarily that every state will give up all of its independence.
2025 is probably too early, but anyway it's only a proposal by the leader of a party probing the path.
but i wouldn't be surprised, leaving aside some catastrophic event, that we will see some sort of federal europe before 2050.
&gt;cuntries well if 17 nations are for it and 10 against it, create a multi-speed europe like was done with the european economic area.
&gt; 17 nations are for it they aren't.
start talking about what it would mean and you'd quickly realize that there isn't enough common ground.
e.g.
poland and hungary are far right and hardcore anti immigration while germany is basically the opposite.
and that's just one topic.
nope not enough.
you need it to be unanimous.
otherwise you get a weird lumpy union with holes in it.
we already have holes with swiss cheese.
the europe hungarians want would be vastly different than those the germans would want.
i think the only way this would work is a two tiered eu, with a federal core (germany, france, the netherlands, belgium, and maybe others) and a less federalized union with the rest of the eu.
it's otherwise too big and varied to be anything other than a trade bloc so soon that's not what federalism means.
most people that want a "united states of europe" are actually centralists and not federalists.
in general the eu is pretty anti federalism and pro centralism.
knock knock the thirteen colonies would like a word.
who's there?
:) that is just federalist dreams.
no way any nation in eu will ceade its rights to their own army, government etc.
united states of europe should be possible only when romanian and spaniard will consider themselves as brothers.
not in some superficial epithet like we like to say in europe now but in way that is close to your own members of nation.
this will need to go on for next 100-200 maybe even 300 years before it will be possible.
forcing nations together against people will will just end up with nations spring again in near future resulting in civil war.
it will indeed take a while, but even today we are starting to see pan-european identities emerge.
hell, emerge is the wrong word.
prior to wwi pan-europeanism was actually very common among intellectuals.
and it's not as if differences will need to be completely erradicated.
many people in the us take pride in both their state and their nation (although we might be a bad example for federalizing considering our current political issues) don't worry, germany got a lot of experience in unifying europe.
doing it economically instead of militarily is a new tactic for them though.
&gt; doing it economically instead of militarily is a new tactic for them though.
much easier to buy something than to steal it ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) tibetans may disagree with you.
they tried to stop us from unifying europe by making every countries economy reliant on each other, thus we'll unify europe by making every countries economy reliant on us!
i can see you are buying your jokes at a discount store.
it seems unlikely for anyone with some understanding of the european history and culture.
independence is a big thing, with many countries like finland, greece or poland only relatively recently having won their independence.
this will not be welcome.
an alliance and a trade union has a lot of support, but a super state does not.
fully agree &gt; that seems pretty unlikely to me without an external threat like war or economic isolation one russia and one china, coming up &gt; pretty unlikely to me without an external threat like war or economic isolation ok. those threats do exist, individual nations in europe are at risk of becoming eclipsed i am pro-eu and i am very much against this.
so i agree.
while i'm absolutely in favour of a more united eu, especially militarily and diplomatically towards the outside, each eu nation should retain their own flavour, as much in their cultures, languages as well their laws.
schulz comes off as wanting to dominate europe, and he's hardly the leader to do that.
julius caesar, charlemagne, napoleon and hitler have tried and failed, and they were all more charming than him.
croatian here, would give up independence in a heart beat to become part of greater european federation.
a european federation would bring critical benefits like security, border control defense and resolution to local law and order issues &gt;croatian here, would give up independence in a heart beat no that's just you and your circle of friends.
we both know a group of people who would fight till the end before accepting this.
and what if we see pan-eurooean nationalism?
is there that much of a 'european' identity to back that up?
germany would (they already have a norm of deferring to brussels for direction), and likely the netherlands and belgium (where brussels is), but all the other countries i've been to have a looooong time and a lot of effort ahead of them before they give up sovereignty.
however, i don't think a united states of europe would be, at least initially, as centralized as even the usa is right now.
this would allow the nations to keep their own identity.
use!
use!
use!
'uripa /r/yurop &gt;schulz added that european values were being systematically undermined in poland, with the eu being unable to do anything about it, while hungary was also moving further and further away from the bloc, including with big deals with china.
what's happening in poland that this dude doesn't like?
https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2016/05/polands-political-cleansing-of-journalists/ &gt;there’s no doubt that poland’s media landscape is undergoing a rapid transformation.
the country’s ranking in the reporters without borders’ world press freedom index plunged from 18 in 2015 to 47 in 2016. the government rushed through a law in the waning hours of 2015 that gave it oversight of the nation’s public broadcaster.
scores of veteran journalists have lost their jobs.
&gt;further changes may be on the way as new media legislation, the so-called “big media law”, is being debated and proposals have been floated to restrict how journalists report from inside the sejm.
&gt;poland has been all about the “good change” since november 2015. the phrase goes back to a campaign video produced in may 2015 for the law and justice (pis) party’s andrzej duda.
the party went on to win the october 2015 elections and duda became the sixth president of poland.
&gt;[...] &gt;in an interview with index on censorship, td co-founder wojciech maziarski said that the recent dismissals have the character of “political cleansing”, which started progressively from the top, and then moved gradually to the lower ranks of what he considers to be state media.
&gt;“the ones to bite the bullet first were journalists and editors of news and current affairs programmes, as they have the biggest influence on public opinion,” he said.
&gt;“the state media is intended to shape citizens of the new, right-wing poland, which means that gradually, all will be replaced who are associated with liberal thought, feminism, left-wing ideas, even if they don’t engage directly in topical political debates,” maziarski added.
&gt;[...] &gt;currently, new media legislation is being considered in parliament.
this draft law would amount to a structural and financial overhaul of the public broadcaster.
under the draft, heads of the new “national media” outlets would be “appointed by a six-person national media council elected by the lower house of parliament, the senate and the president for a six-year term” with one of the council slots legally guaranteed for the largest opposition caucus, according to radio poland.
the proposed law would also replace the current license fee with a monthly “audiovisual” charge added to poles’ electric bills beginning in january 2017.
&gt;unlike poland‘s three other journalists’ unions, towarzystwo dziennikarskie is boycotting the draft media law consultation being conducted by the minister for cultural affairs.
maziarski explains the union’s standpoint: “a big problem for public media in poland is their financing.
the introduction of a general audio-visual fee has been one of the main demands of the journalist environment.
however, the fee introduced through the proposed law is intended to serve the maintenance of an indoctrination machinery and the pis propaganda rather than public media.
in effect, public media in poland have ceased to exist.” poland elected a very right-wing (nationalistic and religious) government.
they started off their term by immediately kicking out non party members out of government positions and tried to pass laws that would enable them to gut courts of judges they don't like and appoint new ones without oversight.
they also passed laws allowing them to take control of state radio and news broadcasters.
so shit's going all authoritarian over there.
hilariously it's backfiring as there's a growing new right-wing-ultra-nationalistic-extremist problem that's even worse than them (white supremacist and even anti-jew rhetoric, but its all mixed) &gt;borderline kkk unless you’re talking about what the kkk was some 100 years ago.
today the klan is an absolute meme and has zero centralized power or representative power in the government.
no matter how many times the media throws its name in a headline, the klan just doesn’t exist to any reasonable capacity poland &amp; hungary are very **very** right-leaning countries.
to give a scale : more than uk - slighty less than us.
both countries aren't very fond of eu despite the fact that they are both in top 5 eu beneficiaries.
they see the eu as way of protecting their independence from russia.
they want a trade union, not a super state.
they see the eu as a source of money because they get billions each year.
that too.
however, we do get this money back because of access to their market.
also, we have basically colonized them economically.
we bought out most of their companies for pretty much peanuts so it is a good deal for us anyway.
&gt; to give a scale : more than uk - slighty less than us.
no, poland and hungary are far more right wing than the us.
certainly more right wing as the us as a whole but even more right wing than pretty much any us state.
honestly, trump would be center right wing in those countries because far right wing there means actual neo nazis/fascists.
the european union was created with the purpose of binding europe's economies so close together, as to make war impossible.
while this would definitely be an extension of that goal, i am split as to whether or not this is the best course of action.
as an eastern european i hope this will happen.
but the dificulties behind such a thing will come exactly from central and eastern countries in the union.
23 eu countries a few weeks ago signed a deal to begin standardizing their armies across the board so all their equipment and supplies are now compatible with each other.
tbf the militaries (well the major ones) have been nato interoperating long before the eu .
yes but nato has always been a side thing to the normal military.
and i work for a company that makes products for eu and us militaries, everything we make is basically custom per country :/ the one product that fits into a common military item would never work with the common military item of another country.
there are definitely some standardized items that come down from nato, but it's only somethings and not everything.
the 23 country pact is to drive everything else in-line with some sort of standard be it nato or eu.
these are the type of small steps juncker meant when he said "we decide on something, leave it lying around and wait and see what happens.
if no one kicks up a fuss, because most people don't understand what has been decided, we continue step by step until there is no turning back."
many people in the eu are against an eu military so they can't outright create it.
instead they take tiny steps which accumulate over time until there is no turning back.
the key players in the eu do not hide the fact they want a federation, they are quite open about this goal and proud of it which makes it all the more insane that people think it is some sort of conspiracy theory.
it takes a certain kind of special to look at how the eu has expanded in scope since it's creation (morphing from a simple trade block to a political entity with it's own courts, currency etc.)
and not realize a federation is the end goal that is constantly being moved towards.
it has never been a secret that the eu has been moving towards a federation and was the very original goal in the first place... &gt;these are the type of small steps juncker meant when he said "we decide on something, leave it lying around and wait and see what happens.
if no one kicks up a fuss, because most people don't understand what has been decided, we continue step by step until there is no turning back."
that's how many difficult political decisions are made.
theoretically, we should get the clear consent from the majority who are adequately informed, but that requires a lot of effort on the individual's side, too.
in reality, this condition rarely exists, which is why most democracies are representative and not direct.
at the same time, both the decision-makers and the electorate get a lot things wrong.
there is nothing overly sinister in this quote, rather it is a little sad as it reflects the limitation of our ability as society maybe.
juncker is at least candid in his cynicism.
what he said is indeed how most political decisions are made, but he is one of the very few politicians who dared utter it on the record.
&gt;many people in the eu are against an eu military so they can't outright create it.
instead they take tiny steps which accumulate over time until there is no turning back.

and not realize a federation is the end goal that is constantly being moved towards.
you are kind of basing this on a wrong assumption.
[the majority of citizens in 24 out of the eu-27 *support* the creation of an eu military.
](https://i.imgur.com/vgnzcfi.png) and while finland is one of the 3 countries against it, the support of an eu military is still higher than support of nato membership in finland.
also as a finn i would note we aren't against eu common defence.
we gleefully signed the pesco agreement just couple weeks back and asked amending it with mention of 42.7 common defense article.
our concern is more on the "this should be purely defensive" and "we have been traditionally neutral".
as for nato, there is far more principled and long standing opposition.
mostly because of great power politics.
we don't want to ruin our russia relations by joining the "team usa" just as we didn't want to join warsaw pact to piss of usa (and end up as soviet pawn).
also kinda anecdotal and don't know how wide this applies, but atleast among my acquaintances it isnt only about russia (though it is a major part).
rather also just direct diplomatic and political baggage overall from being in same explicit military alliance as usa given their hawkish foreign policy as not seen as very enticing.
aka the "how much is this going to cost us from usa politically" case.
maybe nothing, maybe something but one is rather careful in consideration, when traditionally neutral, peace brokering and peacekeeping oriented country of 5 million thinks about the military alliance headed by a rather hawkish military superpower of 300 million.
and on that that said super power is ocean away.
we are far more comfortable doing defense and military dealings firstly with our nordic friends and after that with our european friends.
also ones which we are also integrated in other ways and daily dealing outside of just defence issues.
gives us far better bearing of consider implications of defense cooperation.
not to mention being on more equal footing with not a single clear biggest massive player in the organisation.
if one hasn't figured it out we finns like to have thing planned, consider different scenarios and prepare for them.
also kinda got tired being superpower chess piece during cold war.
so we though if we band up with fellow europeans, then we are less likely to again end up alone and as pawn of one or another super power struggle again.
even if the idea is good the timeline sounds off, unite europe in 8 years?
i assume the negotiations will take a lot longer than that.
yeah, 8 years seems very unrealistic and could raffle more unnecessary feathers than just stating the goal of working towards a united europe.
everybody already knows that this was schultz endgame for a while now, putting a date on it isn't looking solid, it will look silly when it's not reached in time.
i, personally, would love a united europe, but i am not sure that it's going to work like this.
i'm not opposed to the idea, but it very much depends on the details of how it is done.
frankly i can't see most european governments essentially deciding to abolish themselves so it will have huge opposition.
the eu basically already achieved that goal.
onto greater things now!
as an italian, letting my country being run by northern europeans instead of the morons we have had for 150 years?
fuck yeah, sign me up same but spanish.
looking at our politicians, even actual unelected brussels bureaucrats would be an imprpvement you shouldn’t have left the holy roman empire in the first place!
:) i dunno if this turns out anything like the us your politicians will figure out a way to gain disproportional influence and ruin it for everyone.
oh cool, germany trying to unite europe under one banner, what could go wrong?
well they do say third times the charm no?
i think you'll find the is the forth 7 years war?
something else?
the third reich was in the second world war, so a united europe under germany could be called the forth reich "third reich" is a nazi propaganda term that tried to construct a historical continuity between the holy roman empire, the german empire, and nazi germany.
in truth, these entities had nothing to do with each other save for some geographic overlap.
it is sad and shocking how readily people regurgitate nazi propaganda as truth, same with the whole "winter stopped the nazis from conquering russia" bs that totally downplays the soviet contributions to their own defense.
*looks at username* da, is true tovarisch boris.
the weimar republic never tried to unify europe under a single banner though so this would be the actual 3rd attempt.
*fourth thnaks i feel like i have heard this story before.
this time they come in peace!
i'm a uk national and eurosceptic who voted leave in the referendum, but this is massively unfair.
germany has had a huge spiritual renewal since the 1940s and their outlook and motives are completely different to anything in the past.
they are now committed to unifying europe by consensus and peace.
personally, i don't want the uk to be part of such a state, but if they and other countries want to, good luck to them.
it was a joke oh cool, you made the obvious joke.
clap.
"germany" i bet my left nut if we hold a referendum about giving up germany into a united europe, the majority would vote no are u serious?
“see, brexit was worth it after all.” —bojo this but unironically.
i’m not even joking, actually.
if a federal europe was what the eu was going for the uk was never gonna go for that.
http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/archives/eb/eb81/eb81_publ_en.pdf, page 152. right now, there are 17 countries where the relative majority support a federal europe and 10 where the relative majority is against it: * **supporters**: hungary, france, poland, romania, greece, belgium, portugal, croatia, lithuania, slovenia, malta, cyprus, germany, italy, spain, latvia, and bulgaria.
* **objectors**: slovakia, denmark, czech republic, sweden, austria, ireland, finland, luxembourg, netherlands, and estonia.
some of these are quite close germany 42% for "use", 38% against, 20% undecided slovakia 41% for, 43% against, 15% undecided... yeah, i just wanted to list all of them because i didn't want to set an arbitrary limit, so i just went with the relative majority.
this data is almost 4 years old.
a lot has happened in the past 4 years, and a lot has changed.
i'm not sure this is reliable as things stand now.
certainly not reliable enough to claim this represents "right now."
the problem is europe doesn't consult the people and ask what they want they decide and try to push things through often using fear "europe is at risk if this doesn't happen" you would have thought that questions over closer european integration, federalism and a european army would be standard questions for every survey, but they aren't and these things are incredibly contentious.
true, didn't bulgaria elect a pro-russian government fairly recently.
there are some problems with the eurobarometer's methodology.
http://www.mpifg.de/pu/mpifg_dp/dp15-6.pdf some examples: &gt;on the basis of this result, the commission emphasized in its press release that an “overwhelming majority” of europeans were in favor of europe establishing its own navigation system (eb 2007).
problematic here is that 60 percent of the respondents to q5 stated that they had never heard of the “galileo” project.
&gt;perhaps widespread knowledge can be assumed among respondents on the structure and responsibilities of the council, the european parliament, and the commission (though we have serious doubts with regard to the commission).
however, questions on trust also include the european court of auditors, the european economic and social committee, and the european ombudsman.
respondents regularly answer “no” when asked whether they have ever heard of or read about such institutions, but are nevertheless required to state whether they “tend to trust” or “tend not to trust” them (most recently in eb 73).
why would respondents, having no knowledge of the responsibilities and activities of the court of auditors, “not trust” it?
&gt;hypothetical items such as “to reduce eu greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20 percent by 2020 compared to 1990” overburden the cognitive abilities of respondents.
who can evaluate whether such goals are “too ambitious,” “about right,” or “too modest”?
there is a high risk here that respondents will tend to give socially desirable answers rather than actual estimates.
in fact, the survey results showed that two-thirds of respondents judged the goals to be reasonable.
interestingly, even the eurobarometer unit remarked that “this result must probably be analyzed more as the expression of an expectation … than as reasoned opinions on each of the targets”.
but despite this acknowledgement of the question’s failings, it was still used in the commission’s subsequent reporting: “the specific targets set by the european commission to shape the europe 2020 strategy and to measure its results seem reasonable to european citizens” &gt;nearly all the statements veer in a “europe-friendly” direction.
note in particular that items such as “[our country’s] voice counts in the eu” and “the interests of [our country] are well taken into account in the eu” are logically close-by, a situation in which inverse orientation of one of the statements would be clearly appropriate.
such a negatively poled statement was provided for the first time in spring 2008 in the form of “the european union imposes its views on [our country]”.
it immediately received the highest level of agreement and was removed just two surveys later.
interestingly, a statement about the commission taking citizens’ opinions into account was added at the same time.
despite being positively poled, it received only 25 percent of respondent agreement and was also subsequently omitted.
&gt;respondents are, in effect, being presented with a fait accompli, with a choice of only three different time schedules for eastward enlargement.
opposition to enlargement was registered only when respondents revealed it voluntarily and indeed a remarkable 50 percent did so (eb 1995); we can only speculate on the outcome had the respondents been presented with a methodologically clean question.
&gt;at first glance, the way the question is formulated and the available response options appear to be fair.
however, closer examination reveals that this is not so: two of the three optional responses are geared toward support, while only one implies disapproval.
the number and order of the options suggest the presence of a neutral option, which in fact does not exist.
a respondent who selects the apparently neutral option signals approval of emu (“is … necessary”) rather than indifference.
&gt;q12 was a newly introduced question, positioned directly before two questions on attitudes towards eu performance.
q12 requires the interviewer to read out a list of eu accomplishments to respondents who are then asked to select the two best.
let us ignore the peculiar construction of q12 which presumes the success of the eu actions and leaves no room for respondents who may not share the presumption.
(...) q12 was strategically positioned before q13 and q14 in the “future of europe” survey in order to obtain a desired contextual effect.
so a big problem with the eurobarometer is that it's designed very poorly, and quite probably deliberately so in order to provide the commission with the appearance of a higher level of public support for its dealings than actually exists "on the ground".
&gt; on the basis of this result, the commission emphasized in its press release that an “overwhelming majority” of europeans were in favor of europe establishing its own navigation system (eb 2007).
problematic here is that 60 percent of the respondents to q5 stated that they had never heard of the “galileo” project.
why is this a problem though?
i don't see how awareness of the fact that the eu is indeed building a european navigation system would change one's opinion on it.
hungary being one of the supporters tells me that this paper is worthless in regards of how close the respective nations are to agreeing to a federation in the sense of a united states of europe.
&gt;spain for a country that is struggling keeping themselves together, that would be a good move these are generally the countries in favour of federalisation, this way they can get even more money out of successful countries while having the population (in numbers) to prevent any real reform.
this is the main reason rich countries oppose a federal europe.
liberalising the economy impossible, drawing all the wealth out of the nordics, luxembourg and the netherlands yes please.
southern europe in a nutshell.
except most of the successful countries (especially germany, france, and italy) fully support federalization.
&gt;this is the main reason rich countries oppose a federal europe.
they don't.
i don't really know what makes you believe these things.
only ideological hardliners oppose federalization.
there is no rational reason to oppose it.
it benefits everyone, both the weak and strong.
this isn't a zero sum game.
there is a pattern in the supporters and objectors.
and what pattern is that?
bit of an ambitious timeframe considering you aren’t gonna get to be chancellor for at least another few years, if ever.
i don't think it's nearly so crazy as everyone here seems to think.
2025 is the soonest possible, but i think that it's still possible, and, eventually, inevitable.
more importantly, though, i find it strange that a century ago, germany was so intent on bringing europe under one banner, and now they might try to do it again, but in a much more civil manner.
the most recent surgings of nationalism are manufactured out of desperation.
on the small-scale we're still fractured and warring, but in the big picture, coalescence became the name of the game long ago and nothing short of human extinction is stopping that.
this was one of the deciding factors for me when i voted to leave the eu.
i don't believe ever closer union is a positive step for the uk, especially a monetary and defence union with over two-dozen countries - many of whom have vastly different economic output, defence capability, foreign policy and domestic goals.
british voters were told that a "united states of europe" and a "european army" were a **dangerous fantasy** by remain campaigners, despite the fact people like schulz, verhofstadt and juncker have been parroting off this goal of ever closer union for years.
there were lies on both sides of the brexit referendum.
the big red bus was one that is frequently thrown in peoples' faces.
but we never hear of things like this.
i feel at least a little vindicated that the eu is being much more transparent about their future goals.
an ever-integrating eu would've been no place for the uk anyway, so it's probably better we leave now, before we're given ultimatums that we simply can't refuse (schengen, the euro and participation in a common defence policy separate of nato spring to mind).
we would eventually be pushed anyway if we refused to get in line with further integration.
[**"dangerous fantasy!
"**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ruu-4f6uga) just my opinion.
i have nothing against the eu becoming more federalised, with a centralised power base in brussels, if that is what the citizens of the other member states truly want.
but i am just happy the uk won't be a part of it.
this also justifies my vote last year as well.
back when i was laughed at when i told them this is what they (the eu) wanted.
thus justifying brexit.
more like taking advantage of the fact that uk can't bog things down anymore.
i'm said this often, but brexit was the best thing happening to the eu in decades.
yes, but prior to brexit the eu would vehemently deny any plans for a federal union.
this guy is not the eu.
during the referendum when leave campaigners talked about a 'united states of europe' they were laughed at and called fear mongers.
and britain will no longer be bogged down by poor 2nd world eastern european nations with their outstretched hands.
if that's true they should stop trying to punish britain for leaving.
no one is "punishing" britain for anything.
britain is negotiating from a position of not knowing what it wants.
can't he at least come up with a name that has a cooler acronym?
cool.
we do have to implement a better system than the usa though.
no fptp, enough power for every citizen in votes in both supranational and national elections.
it'll be a tricky balance between giving the citizens of germany and france the majority of the power, and them being overpowered by relatively small states.
uniting the states was no easy task, and that was with the advantage of being under one language and mostly one culture.
big states don't want to be tied down, small states don't want to be ignored, and there was a lot of fighting along the way &gt;it'll be a tricky balance between giving the citizens of germany and france the majority of the power, and them being overpowered by relatively small states.
what if you had two legislative bodies?
one of them will have equal representatives from each nation, and one will be based off of population?
any legislation would have to go through both legislative bodies.
that way the smaller nations people won't feel like they are being drowned out without a say, but yet the higher population will still have more representation?
&gt;we do have to implement a better system than the usa though &gt;propose exact same system as usa hmmm (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞ right now, the parliament represents the people, with each country having a number of me proportional to its population, and the european council gathers the heads of state.
the european council unanimously decides of the general policy of the eu, especially regarding the diplomacy.
the european parliament pass legislation.
that works well.
but under that system there would be a legislative body where, say, malta and luxembourg would have the same weight as france and germany.
if a couple of nations combined have (i'm just inventing numbers here) a million citizens while another couple of nations have 100 million, i don't feel like it's right to give them equal power in a legislative body.
laws could be blocked even if they are agreed upon by 80% of the european population just because a lot of very small states oppose them.
but without such a system, would the people of malta have really any voice?
they would have the same voice as any other citizen, while under the proposed system a maltese (?)
citizen would have about 200 times the voice of a german citizen.
in one legislative body.
in the other, it would go strictly by population yeah, but again, since both legislative bodies can block laws the fact that one legislative body would ignore population differences would allow for laws that are agreed upon by a really large majority of the population to be blocked by a lot of very small states.
the electoral college is in place for good reason, and the structure would lend itself quite well when there are "have" and "have not" nations vying for a fair shake.
example; new york, with all its population, cannot feed itself, it requires the agriculture of other states in order to function properly, just as those states require financial resources from new york.
now, if ny wanted to use its population as leverage against the smaller states, there is nothing to stop them beyond the electoral college, and that is why it is in place.
if one state tries to leverage another, the one being leveraged may decide to send their grain or fresh water somewhere else.
at that point, population means nothing.
if you can't feed them, they'll move to the state that can, and then the state that thought it had the bargaining chip in population has neither.
to make this about europe, what would protect the small nation of luxembourg interests if their small voice didn't carry the same weight as a large one, like germany?
not much.
they can't defend themselves politically or militarily, so if this agreement passes through, and their votes aren't weighted, it's essentially the most passive of takeovers of all time.
i love living in europe and being part of the eu, but i don't like the sound of this.
is he saying that if you don't agree with the new 'constitution' you'll just be thrown out?
what kind of backwards thinking is that?
i think it’s more along the lines of “if you don’t *follow* the constitution” it's anti democratic thinking - which is the prevailing type of thought in the upper echelons of the eu.
eu citizens can vote in eu elections, just because *you* are not aware of that doesn't mean it's not happening.
[deleted] one thing i find confusing in many criticisms of the eu is how people equate “indirectly elected” with “not elected”.
just because a body was not directly elected by the people doesn’t make it anti-democratic.
the federal council (the executive branch) in switzerland is elected by parliament, not directly by the people.
is switzerland undemocratic?
of course not.
when it comes to the eu: - the parliament is directly elected by the people - the council of ministers is made up of the democratically elected governments of the member states.
- the european commission is chosen by the democratically elected governments of the member states and confirmed by the democratically elected european parliament.
same people who call eu politicians unelected say trump was elected 'by the people'.
the president of the eu commission is now elected as well.
individual commissioners are nominated by their member state.
the european council consists of the heads of government of the eu.
the council of ministers comprises of ministers from each member state.
because it is a representative democracy?
sure, people could vote for the cabinet as well, but the forming if government is usually delegated by the parliament to the biggest block/party.
besides, the parliament has all the power to remove cabinet from office by holding a vote of no confidence.
if the legislative branch represents the people, then the executive branch should follow the interest of the people.
if not, the the people has to elect new representatives.
why is a system that is used in most modern democracies undemocratic?
seems more like an idea for...2100?
2150?
2025 is just being dumb.
fourth time's the charm, right?
fourth time?
did i miss something?
&gt;the nazi regime called itself the "third reich," counting the holy roman empire as the first and the 1871 german empire as the second, and ignoring the weimar republic.
put us on the fast track to 1984.
&gt;“this constitutional treaty must then be presented in all member states and those that do not agree would automatically leave the eu,” he said.
that alone makes me say no to this, however much i'd like to see better co-operation within the eu.
how could you join a union without agreeing to the constitution though?
edit: unless you want the eu to force its members to sign lol **[[yurop, fuck yeah!
]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jk-ncrmvcw)** yeah that's not going to happen in that time frame.
not a chance.
not a bad idea imo this guy is nuts balkans 2: pan-european boogaloo incoming.
and an opposition seeks a confederation of fully sovereign euro nations.
i think in terms of how the global economy will be shifting this may be necessary.
why united states of europe?
that’s too much like usa, we have our own legacy to consider: holy roman empire, or just roman empire.
:) finally, we can chant "u.s.e., u.s.e., u.s.e.!"
what if uk is right?
wow germany really wants to take over europe, one way or another.
this is why all my friends voted leave in the eu referendum.
they were utterly convinced this was going to happen and just like every treaty change since the u.k. joined the eu we (the people) would not be given a vote on the matter.
they felt the referendum was the only time they would ever be allowed to vote on the direction the eu was taking.
will it be blood this time?
iron?
blood and iron?
let's tune in in 8 years and find out.
i wouldn't like to sacrifice diversity or focus power at the top.
i prefer power at the base of the pyramid, and a diverse set of states.
it's better to bicker about everything than to have one single leader.
it's a choice between the 'bazaar and cathedral', like open source vs microsoft.
one is like an ecosystem, flexible and open, the other closed and hierarchical like a factory.
so glad that guy is not the chancelor.
too much too soon.
no need to kid with us germany, you can just call it the 4th reich instead fastest way to undermine your significance on the world stage.
force change that will trigger a civil unrest.
great idea the gradual erosion of sovereignty.
bad idea.
with every level of government you create additional separation between the problem and the solution.
for instance, you cannot legislate vermont the same way you legislate boston.
you have different demographics, economies, and landscapes.
the founding fathers stressed the importance of small federal government and we should have listened.
&gt; the founding fathers stressed the importance of small federal government and we should have listened.
ironically as they decided to scrap the idea of a "small federal government" and "state rule" to create a strong federal government helmed by a constitution which effectively ended a loose coalition of states and turned it into a single country?
a constitution by the way in which the only federal position directly elected by the voters was their house representative.
you're massively off the mark.
nah no thank you!
i'd rather not utterly destroy the frankly brilliant society that i live in as a dane, only to become an insignificant part of a boundless bureaucracy!
the idea alone is enough to make me shudder.
especially when such a projected is headed by a germany, one of the biggest proponents of the deep surveillance state.
if such a thing were to happen, we'd have roughly 20-40 years before we'd be living in america-light, with a government that isn't accountable to anyone but largely anonymous donors.
absolutely not.
i'd probably just move at that point.
i'd be absolutely loathe to do so, but a "united states of europe" is *not* a viable option.
dear god, no.
new world order.
deny it all you want.
it's gonna happen.
remember when we successfully reduced the size and occurrence of ozone holes by banning cfcs?
if that can happen, so i'm cautiously optimistic that this can as well.
we found an alternative for cfc.
what's the substitute for plastic?
it's a great material when you think about it.
edit: everyone on reddit has a solution!
for grocery bags paper is a great replacement, paper is biodegradable.
micro plastics have been banned in canada and the united states for two years now.
they have found natural exfoliants that they can add into soaps.
every problem has a solution.
it's not actually as dire as we're lead to believe.
the difficult replacements for plastics will be things like bottled water or car interiors.
the actual replacements exist, they're just not economically viable for most people.
edit: and not to mislead but this is throwaway plastic, like the clear wrapping on packaging.
most of this stuff can be replaced with paper, bee's wrap, or silicone.
as far as bottles go we could use something called glass but thats never been done before .
also who throws out a cars dashboards thats not something that ends up in the ocean usually.
you don't ghost ride your old car off the dock when you get a new one?
&gt; you don't ghost ride your old car off the dock when you get a new one?
if i don't do that, i will have to deal with parking, which is *way* more expensive.
well ive heard of letting someone swim with the fishes but didnt think a car would find a good home at the bottom of the ocean.
normaly a car heaven would be as a re used nail.
i don't get who buys drinks in plastic bottles over glass, plastic tastes plastic-y.
well in the uk at least, its almost impossible to buy most soft drinks in a glass bottle.
some pubs still do them, but squash, coke and other fizzy drinks, bottled water etc.
nearly all come in plastic.
fuck, really?
i've lived my entire life with "return-able" bottles they charge you extra for but refund upon returning them to a store.
many of those are glass.
many local bottled water sellers do the same as well, some even get delivered in a similar fashion to how milk used to.
is this that unusual?
it is to me.
the only thing that you get in glass bottles here is snapple.
and i don't live in one of the 4 or 5 states that will pay you 5 cents to return bottles.
fuck i live in fucking uruguay how is this unusual in the rest of the world, i mean, both coca cola and pepsi does it over here, as well as local beer brands.
according to my grandparents that's how it used to be in the uk.
(back in the sixties at least) whereabouts do you live?
depends where you live.
i grew up in ny and this was the norm!
also the deposit keeps the cans off the street by way of homeless people and teenagers who need some extra dough.
later i moved to ga where this was unheard of!
in muricah, most drinks are in plastic bottles, but some fancy soda comes in glass.
there's a massive cost of shipping glass bottles.
your case of soda would weigh a couple of pounds more if in glass.
fun fact, redbull was (still is?)
all canned in austria and shipped all over the world.
realizing the ends of the cans weigh significantly more than the sides, increasing their shipping costs, they came up with tall narrow redbull can we know.
saving just a few grams per can can add up when you sell millions of units.
&gt; also who throws out a cars dashboards you have, clearly, never been to baltimore.
pretty sure in my years here i've seen individual pieces that could be assembled together into an entire car laying around the city.
the problem is that a lot of consumer goods and trash gets shipped internationally, which for obvious reasons gets transported over the sea.
a lot of ships and shipping containers go missing at sea, thus plastic trash of all sorts in the oceans.
what about biodegradable plastics like [pla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polylactic_acid)?
only biodegradable in certain conditions.
also doesnt have the combination of properties that make certain plastics useful.
i agree that plastics probably aren't strictly necessary for consumer goods.
but what about medical equipment?
what will we use for iv drips?
the introduction of plastics into hospitals allowed for much more efficient and sterile operations and drastically improved patient outcomes.
i don't know of an alternative for that purpose.
&gt; substitute thats not the problem, the problem is breaking them down which is a problem being [worked on](https://voices.nationalgeographic.org/2017/04/28/scientists-discover-the-secret-to-breaking-down-plastic-beeswax-eating-worms/) there’s also some kind of fungus which can break it down so we should just get waste facilities that break them down to solve the problem and also ships/sea farms that suck up water from the ocean doing the same thing i would say a large number of applications already have alternatives in waxed/sealed pressed paper or fiberboard.
the problem is durability.
plastic won out for the very reason we're having problems now - it takes forever to break down and it is very shock resistant.
from my time in florida, you literally have to have the sun baking it day in and day out for it to become brittle to even begin breaking down.
even then, it just turns into smaller bits of plastic not using it so disposably.
cutting out plastic bottles would help a lot.
i think we just need a replacement for dumping it into streams and water supplies there is, add redemption values to encourage collection and recycling.
more recycling is my theory unfortunately not all plastics are recyclable.
many consumer level ones are (called thermoform plastics).
they can be heated up and melted and re-formed into a new product.
however there are also a lot of plastics that cannot be recycled (thermoset plastics).
these plastics burn before they melt, so they cannot be reformed.
even another consideration is that every time a plastic gets re-used, it gets weaker.
so even with the ability to recycle plastic, you cannot recycle the same plastic indefinitely.
eventually the molecular structure breaks down enough that it looses much of its strength and becomes useless.
at that point even recyclable plastics have to end up in landfill.
depending on the application, glass, wood, steel or tin.
for ex a lot of plastic bottles could be replaced with glass.
i don't mind glass if they can make it not shatter into tiny sharp pieces.
my dog had his paws cut up pretty badly once, i don't really want more of that in nature either... i feel like there would be a number of alternatives to plastic, is it really that hard to imagine?
perhaps not a single material as widely applicable, but in any given context there's surely a viable substitute.
there's also this https://www.good.is/articles/agar-plasticity-amam-araki-maetani-muraoka-packaging i can across edible seaweed that could be alternative to plastic.
ling below.
there was a video on that too.
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-evoware/indonesian-startup-wages-war-on-plastic-with-edible-seaweed-cups-iduskbn1dn0xa edit: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nva6mgqarfu) i answer isn't to find a substitute for plastics, but to find a substitute for dumping it in the oceans.
multiple alternatives have been found.
go to costco, you can buy 100x3l bags for municipal composting programs that biodegrade quickly and are leak proof.
the problems are many but cities like new york shipping their garbage out to sea is an obvious one that needs to stop.
my university got rid of plastic forks and knives and replaced them with some material made out of potato.
it's the same old shit going on in any discussion.
deluded kid living in their own reality calling out people or companies to make themselves feel better.
they believe by doing so they are more moral, they are superior.
they would throw tantrum and blame you for everything if you take them seriously.
in this case their solution is to use wax paper to replace packaging material but where are we going to get so much wax paper?
how many orangutans habitats are we going to destroy?
there's the problem of increase cost too.
how do they plan to solve all this sub problems?
maybe throwing more tantrum online!
the majority of plastic in the ocean comes from just a handful of river systems, most of them in asia.
there's absolutely a way to do a targeted crackdown.
seriously, cheap unbleached paper.
it can be made out of the crap thats grows on the side of the road.
how many subsidized monopolizes did it take to displace the cellulose based packaging industry?
i think this is a good place to bring up the impact plastic straws have on our oceans.
every single-use plastic straw that is thrown away takes nearly 200 years to degrade.
these have a direct impact on marine life and ocean quality, and end up in the food chain due to accidental ingestion by fish and mammals.
please consider using hard plastic reusable straws or steel straws.
they’re available [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/b01l0fmaug/ref=asc_df_b01l0fmaug5294339/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;amp;creative=395033&amp;amp;creativeasin=b01l0fmaug&amp;amp;linkcode=df0&amp;amp;hvadid=193985494725&amp;amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvrand=6641413700729078505&amp;amp;hvpone=&amp;amp;hvptwo=&amp;amp;hvqmt=&amp;amp;hvdev=m&amp;amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;amp;hvlocint=&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9016864&amp;amp;hvtargid=pla-332338385914) on amazon for less than five dollars.
at the very least, consider using the same disposable plastic straw through multiple drinks instead of throwing it away after every single refill.
this is a very small thing that most people can change that can have a drastic impact on the environment.
thank you.
i hate disposable plastic anything, and always try to use multiple times (usually until it breaks) i work for a plastic company.
please stop throwing our products into the ocean.
thank you.
i live on the earth.
please stop making so much disposable shit that never breaks down and ends up in the ocean.
thank you.
try living without our disposable shit for awhile and see how it works out millennials: "challenge: accepted!"
you’re both right.
kind of late to the party un.
what's a few decades of dumping tonnes of plastics into the oceans.
sucks, but, a little late is better than never.
"in an unprecedented move, the un continued to say a bunch of things and do nothing."
?
the un is not a dictatorship, it's on the countries that are part of the un to realise these goals.
who controls the un?
the security council.
when one of those members decides to do something, then the un springs into action.
until that happens, it's a bunch of talk that is years behind public knowledge.
i'm not sure you have a great grasp on the un.
til the security council of the un deals with environmental policies.
"in an unprecedented move, redditor criticises un without actually knowing what the fuck he's talking about."
did you read the article?
a speech was made, a bunch of representatives signed a document saying plastic needs to stop entering the world's oceans but no agreement was made or plan put in place to stop the flow of plastic into the ocean.
and yet i'm the idiot i think his point was (although he attacked you rather than explain his position) that the un acts more like the conscience of the world rather than an actual authoritarian arm.
it doesn't really have a lot of actual power unless the un representatives can convince their respective countries to actually follow through.
so your statement makes it seem like once they say these things they should act on them but don't when it isn't really the fault of the un for not doing so because the impetus falls upon its member states.
&gt; the un acts more like the conscience of the world meanwhile, 2 decades ago in rwanda... i'm not saying they get it right all the time or ever for that matter but ostensibly that is the intent.
&gt; the un acts more like the conscience of the world no, it really [doesn't](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/11/un-peacekeepers-accused-killing-rape-central-african-republic) unless you are willing to say that the world is a psychopath, then it may be true.
&gt; the un acts more like the conscience of the world &gt; no, it really doesn't unless you are willing to say that the world is a psychopath, then it may be true.
it was originally intended to but humans have a way of turning everything we touch into shit even when we have the best of intentions.
but they signed a document!!!
much as i hate to admit it, you are totally right.
there is absolutely no legal agreement or incentive for any country to comply.
yep.
all they did was say, "plastic needs to stop being thrown in the ocean."
umm, i'm pretty sure most people realized that years ago.
why don't they sign documents saying, "we should find the cure to cancer" and "people in third world countries should have clean water" while they're at it.
i think the idea, as ridiculous as this sounds, is to recognize that dumping plastic into the ocean is a bad thing internationally.
i know it's common sense, but there are a lot of bad or ignorant people out there who would tell you that plastics have no adverse effect on the ocean or marine life.
i mean, i get that it's not much, but it really is better than nothing.
it's a baby step in the right direction.
would a law requiring all packaging to be biodegradable/glass help fight against plastic?
how would glass be any better?
glass is not biodegradable; however, it is non reactive and does not leach chemicals into the water.
it is non reactive.
it is pretty much everywhere already in nature as sand (silicon dioxide).
it is also more easily reusable/recyclable than plastic.
words are wind aren't 10 of the top 10 water ways responsible for plastic flowing into the oceans in asia?
“scientists welcomed the statement, but were unhappy the agreement was only based in principle, with no firm targets or timetables” so just empty words so far.
the huge problem with plastics is that they aren’t consumed by microbes.
all those millions of tons of plastics in the oceans and in our soil just get shredded into microscopic pieces which are poisonous to all life.
from the microscopic base of the marine/land food chains and all the way up to fish and animals.
there’s micro-plastics in your drinking water and your food.
also (and sorry for the language) can we please stop with the fucking clampshell packaging.
you need the jaws of life to get the crap out of that packaging.
or the heavily laminated 15x20" cardboard for a 1"x1" product... marketing needs to smarten up.
start by finding a way from stopping manufactures from making products slightly more expensive to buy a new fridge for example then it is too but 1 control board 399 =fridge 350 =board cue the finger from american republicans.
all packaging must be compostable, then it can all be diverted to growing forests and food.
the usa says that's bullshit and that they are doubling down on plastics finally we have hope leaving beautiful things for our children's children.
this is good, better late than never.
mom nature can bounce back, but only if you stop kicking her when she is down.
the human race is truly disgusting sometimes... (clarification: when it comes to throwing plastic away and allowing what has happened to our oceans) with all the stupid shit going on, i guess its nice to know that somebody somewhere is still trying to to something productive.
too bad its a lost cause.
too late.
the majority of fish and sea birds have ingested plastic that remains in their system.
should of done this years ago, one wonders why people wake up now?
plastic has displaced metal, wood and glass so what it’s realistic replacement?
&gt; plastic has displaced metal, wood and glass so what it’s realistic replacement?
there is none.
sure we can lower their use by stopping the overpackaging of goods for instance, but it's less about replacing plastics and more about properly collecting them, preferably recycling or repurposing them when possible.
honestly, even burning them is fine and manageable *if we drastically decrease our other consumptions of petroleum as a fuel*.
that ship has sailed.
the majority of marine life has been compromised by plastic fibers.
next time you go eat a mussel, keep in mind your ingesting plastic.
🙈 so what?
should we just threw our arms in the air and lament?
better plastic waste collection isn't the solution, it's part of the solution.
yes we will have to clean up our previous mess for a real improvement of the situation, but a step taken in the right direction is always better than sitting on our ass and cry over how terrible things are.
we survived way worse than plastics in our food, we just need to stop denying the issue or talk about how things are so dire and start to actually do something about it.
it’s all lip service for big business.
koch brothers control the administration now and china has no plans to scale back their massive plastics manufacturing.
pointless.
you can't have it both ways.
you can't say the system is broken all repair and while complaining nice and warm at home doing nothing.
if there's absolutely nothing to do to salvage the us democracy, then stop talking the talk and start walking the walk.
civil war all the way!
or you can come to realize that doom &amp; gloom comments without backing them up with actions are also pointless and stop making them.
you’ve reached the confluence of my idealism and realism.
to proceed further is just a waste of my time.
there is no viable solution and that’s just a fact.
here is another fact, the plastic in the ocean now weighs more than all the fish in the ocean.
plastic is not projected to outweigh sea life until 2050, there is still hope.
i'm a 45 year old dude who cares little for the environment but yesterday i told my wife, no more glitter for our daughter.
it's a micro plastic and it's killing the fish i said.
no problem she said, they have environmentally safe glitter.
so i said, "no you misunderstand me, the fish think she too old for glitter."
nah ha.
what fluff
doesnt this happen literally all the time?
yes been a while, easier to get casualties if you hit people with cars or go out to stab school children.
no, it happens literally all the time.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_palestinian_rocket_attacks_on_israel,_2016 they haven't updated it for the rest of 2016 or 2017 yet.
or shoot innocent people while they are passengers in cars doesn't always have to be a terrorist attack, it could just be a regular accident; http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-settler-accused-of-running-over-killing-palestinian-girl-furush-beit-dajan-jordan-valley-west-a7916896.html http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/west-bank-israel-palestine-israeli-troops-shot-and-killed-14-year-old-palestinian-boy-says-official-a7092811.html or use a percision missile to blow up school children and still manage to miss the "weapons depot" which military intelligence claimed was next to it.
edit: it's easy to point fingers but hard to find peace.
tends to happen when hamas has been found (multiple times) to be storing rockets inside areas such as schools and hospitals, as well as firing them from within.
[ rockets found in unrwa school, for third time](https://www.timesofisrael.com/rockets-found-in-unrwa-school-for-third-time/) [hamas quietly admits it fired rockets from civilian areas](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/hamas-quietly-admits-it-fired-rockets-from-civilian-areas/380149/) [ israel hits symbols of hamas rule as un finds rockets in school](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/gaza-conflict-israel-hits-symbols-of-hamas-rule-as-un-finds-rockets-in-school-1.2721035) [un report confirms hamas stored and fired weapons from un schools](http://www.thetower.org/1955-un-report-confirms-hamas-stored-and-fired-weapons-from-un-schools/) now whats your excuse for hamas firing thousands of missiles at israel point blank, from within civilian zones?
the weapons depot you are claiming was missed would be moved.
the same reason you bunk down in a hospital if you don't want to be bombed.
uh..when exactly was that?
was it before or after the unrwa found depots of rockets and tunnels under schools and told hamas to knock that bullshit off?
this happen all the time.
but the reason the idf now announced this latest rocket salvo is because the rockets landed in gaza, and if there is casualties, hamas would say to bbc/cnn "israel bombed us !"
and the entire eu/un would condemn israel and send a few more millions to hamas.
so the idf says "look up !
it's hamas !
not us, and if someone is dead it's on hamas" since i'm sure you won't hear about it if those rockets will land in israel since no one cares about dead israelis because fuck israel right ?
example - hamas rockets hit an hospital in gaza and killed 11 kids [‘misfired hamas rockets’ killed children in gaza'](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/misfired-hamas-rockets-killed-children-in-gaza-r0xllf679pc) it began once israel removed all its settlements from gaza and withdrew completely as part of a peace agreement.
before then there were no rocket attacks coming from gaza.
&gt; israel removed all its settlements from gaza and withdrew completely as part of a peace agreement.
what was the date that peace agreement was signed?
gaza has a few terrorist organizations that from time to time "fire" a rocket.
i wrote "fire" because they usually don't hit anything and cause little to no damage(i'm not including rockets fired by hamas, that didn't happen for a long time now).
iirc yes, it happens every few weeks or so but this time the rocket landed in gaza.
except for when they indescrimately kill civilians.
iirc last time it killed someone was 3 years ago, but yea.
"attempted war crime" isn't much better than "successful war crime," imho because of israel's defense systems which is worse, when "they" indiscriminately kill civilians or when israel actually discriminately kills civilians?
depends.
are those civilians killed because hamas likes to [put them in the line of fire](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ndtv-exclusive-how-hamas-assembles-and-fires-rockets-641680) or because israel targeted them (tricky question - only one of those is true) ?
they're both bad.
israel's crimes does not justify palestine's crimes.
don't try to play the "whatabout" card here.
i'm not, but before you talk more shit about palestinian's just reminding you that everyone is guilty over there actually, they do fire.
the quotes you trying to use for whitewashing it is around "targets", since they fire the rocket with the hope it will hit something israeli.
are you suggesting that "peace loving muslim palestinians" attack other people?
/s only according to hasbarists.
there was a period from november of 2012 to june of 2014 when hamas didn't fire a single rocket at israel, and only started firing them again in response to dozens of israeli airstrikes... at least according to israeli government sources.
https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-fired-rockets-for-first-time-since-2012-israeli-officials-say/ says a lot abit the bias of reddit the fact your source gets down voted but no one has a leg to try and contest it.
"america did something we didn't like, lets try to kill israeli civilians!"
[they attacked a kosher restaurant in amsterdam.
](http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2017/12/man-waving-palestinian-flag-smashes-amsterdam-kosher-restaurant-window/) remember they only hate zionists not all jews!
/s it's funnier when they protest the jews who fought against the nazis and the fascists in italy.
in all fairness the arab leadership was allied with nazis in wwii.
the grand mufti of jerusalem and hitler were bffs.
there was a sizable contingent of muslim ss.
so, it makes complete sense that the arabs around jerusalem would be protesting the jews who fought against their allies.
palestinian muslims also fought along side jews [against the nazis](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/fisk/why-an-arab-and-a-jew-fought-hitler-then-each-other-and-died-as-friends-77794.html), while the [jewish terrorist group lehi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lehi_\(group\)#wartime_contacts_with_italy_and_germany) tried make an alliance with the nazis and did ally themselves with fascist italy.
your attempt paint the situation in black and white is revisionist history.
you're referring to tiny anecdotal exceptions.
in terms of numbers and effects, arabs were pro-nazi.
end of story.
in terms of numbers and effects the vast majority of arabs didn't take sides in wwii.
however, there were [thousands of arabs](https://books.google.com/books?id=xtktppedttqc&amp;pg=pa141#v=onepage&amp;q=%224000%20arabs%20in%20the%20british%20armed%20forces%22&amp;f=false) who served in the british armed forces against the nazis, while you haven't shown anywhere near that level of support among arabs for the nazis.
the largest force of organized native troops in arabia was the axis-aligned [free arabian legion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_arabian_legion), some 20000 in number... **5 times that of the number you mentioned** this isn't a very difficult situation to prove, because the arabs were almost uniformly allied with nazis.
that wiki page doesn't cite a single source for any of its claims, the 20,000 number or otherwise.
but even if that figure is correct it's a tiny fraction of the arab population of the time and hence doesn't come anywhere close to backing your "almost uniformly" claim.
&gt; in terms of numbers and effects, arabs were pro-nazi.
actually, in terms of numbers and effects, some arabs they were anti-colonial overlords (the british and the french), and with good reason.
no that's not end of story that's your american pea sized brain sucking up israeli propaganda did the arabs react to nazis warmly?
some did, as you said, the grand mufti did, they weren't bff's but he saw that if the nazis won he could get land of that.
there were arabs who saw the defeat of the western imperial powers as a positive.
but were the nazis themselves, or did they support germany?
did they even know what germany is, what it is doing?
the answer is some did, some didn't.
there was no leadership in middle eastern country that was close to nazi tho, not during, not after the war.
&gt; in all fairness... don't pretend you are interested in fairness.
between 1936 and 1939 the british trained and armed tens of thousands of jewish militia in the levant, and then used them to kill, injure, exile or jail a full 10% of the male, indigenous population.
of course some palestinians would choose to align themselves with the enemies of their colonial overlords.
that doesn't mean that they had the same opinions.
by your logic, israel aligning itself with the saudis against iran means that israelis all hold the same opinions as the government of saudi arabia (including that israel must withdraw to its 1967 borders).
who is "they", exactly?
muslims.
all billion and a half of them?
really?
it must have been a really big restaurant.
"we are a peaceful people!
give us what we want and we will stay peaceful!".
i hope people realise that these people are not peaceful, and no matter what they will always be violent.
this has been happening daily for ages.
it has nothing to do with what america did.
not sure if you read the papers but israelis and palestinians have been killing each other daily forever.
yeah, iirc hamas launches upwards of 1,000 missiles at israel annually.
nothing new here do you know palestinians have no control over hamas?
this is the game palestinians play.
they elect hamas.. make deals with hamas.. hamas has run gaza for nearly a decade... and hamas is 100% made up of palestinians.. yet somehow people are dumb enough to try to persuade us to think palestinians =/= hamas.
i don't believe i commented on either of those entities.
the way you worded it made me think you implied it was the general consensus in the state.
the way i worded it was an overly simplistic, sarcastic comment based on people's inability to internally rationalize what the people who launched the rocket were thinking and how they came to the conclusion that this was the correct course of action.
[deleted] do you think hamas takes orders from these people?
the important word is "control" hamas is made up entirely of palestinians...not to mention elected by said palestinians.
sounds the same as many oppressive governments israel has been putting a stranglehold on the palestinians for years.
this announcement by a u.s. president just reaffirms israel's crimes.
this is going to be really bad.
such a lie.
when the arabs took control of jerusalem they expelled jews from the land and used jewish graves to pave roads, destroyed jewish shops, and destroyed jewish holy relics.
they had their chance.
tell me, would you rather be a jew in east jerusalem or an arab in west jerusalem?
there’s your answer jordanians even used the tombstones for [paths to army latrines](https://books.google.com/books?id=0x4baaaaqbaj&amp;q=latrine).
while the atrocities committed against jews and jewish holy places when jordan took control of the east jerusalem are completely inexcusable, so is using that in attempt to deny the stranglehold israel has long been putting on palestinians by turning a blind eye to the [atrocities committed against christians and muslims and their holy places](https://books.google.com/books?id=se_xaaaaqbaj&amp;pg=ra1-pt136&amp;lpg=ra1-pt136&amp;dq=1948+churches+and+mosques+destroyed&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u5lbyemnpx&amp;sig=whrdxts2iuwrwqcfdi3cssxa3va&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjwtcxr5vpxahxbtsykhzvtdzcq6aeiwzal#v=onepage&amp;q=1948%20churches%20and%20mosques%20destroyed&amp;f=false) when israel took control of most of palestine.
here's a [description of the situation from palestinian christian leaders](http://www.kairospalestine.ps/sites/default/files/english.pdf), which reads in part: &gt;1.1 “they say: 'peace, peace' when there is no peace” (jer.
6:14).
these days, everyone is speaking about peace in the middle east and the peace process.
so far, however, these are simply words; the reality is one of israeli occupation of palestinian territories, deprivation of our freedom and all that results from this situation: &gt;1.1.1 the separation wall erected on palestinian territory, a large part of which has been confiscated for this purpose, has turned our towns and villages into prisons, separating them from one another, making them dispersed and divided cantons.
gaza, especially after the cruel war israel launched against it during december 2008 and january 2009, continues to live in inhuman conditions, under permanent blockade and cut off from the other palestinian territories.
&gt;1.1.2 israeli settlements ravage our land in the name of god and in the name of force, controlling our natural resources, including water and agricultural land, thus depriving hundreds of thousands of palestinians, and constituting an obstacle to any political solution.
that's a stranglehold, and denying that reality is a lie.
just seeing the reaction from muslims after this announcements confirms to me that president trump is doing the right thing.
so you're cool with israelis continuing their stranglehold on christians in the land of jesus's birth as long as muslims there are suffering the same fate?
no i’m cool with muslims having no land in jerusalem and ultimately renouncing all of their lands and their religion.
muhammad was a rapist and a murderer and the koran is an instruction book for terror such blatant lies i sure trust a user named god-king_donald that is only 19 days old....yep.
well he’s right so maybe you should so you are saying that israel is 100% clean of all crimes?
because that would be blatant lies.
edit: i'm not surprised i'm arguing with another donald dipshit.
everyone that responds to you isn't wrong just because they also lean conservative.
open up your viewpoints for once, maybe.
yet everyone that has responded to me has been a trump supporter...even though god-trump_whatever his name is is blatantly lying as well.
but i guess i should 'open my viewpoint' to blatant garbage that is not true.
except it is true, and you're gravely mistaken about history.
so israel is not guilty of any crimes?
okay... you’re not no.. no it's not but palestinians launching rockets at israel is all good eh.
waahhhhh dirty yahud won't let me kill them!
waahhhhh i'm so oppressed!!!
you have to remember, whatever you think about this situation, they are not listened to, they are walked all over and there’s an american orangutan who’s just told the world that the most disputed spot is now the capital of israel.
you can sit around and say that the palestinians/hamas are bad, kill kids, blah blah... but have you seen a photo of gaza recently?
do you know there are children there?
again, for anyone dense enough to assume that i’m saying that firing rockets at people is a good idea... that’s not what i’m saying.
i’m saying they are desperate and have literally no one listening or helping them.
imagine if you’re home was besieged and everyone was saying you deserved it, or hooray for the people doing it... you’d fire some fucking rockets too.
you're making a *lot* of assumptions on my knowledge and views based off a silly comment on the internet.
that’s what the internet is for lol besides, it’s more a venting of frustration than anything.
nothing personal (i think you could probably tell) so you're just going to blatantly ignore all israel's crimes against palestine and try to paint it as if this is just a response to trump's announcement?
no, i'm going to make a shitpost on the internet that completely ignores most of the important factors to make a joke at one side's expense.
i laughed.
but then again i took it as a joke and not a sophisticated assessment of the current political situation in the middle east.
i've noticed that there *always* the few that either don't get it, or they refuse to get it and just want to fight over things on the internet.
look up the aipac.
israel has more influence on the u.s. than you'd think.
why is this downvoted to hell?
this is the truth.
israel lobbies (bribes) the shit out of congress for support.
how else do you get the largest superpower on earth to veto any movement to stop your morally bankrupt policies and illegal settlements, get tons of free weapons/aid, all at the expense of us taxpayers who get shafted and benefit nothing.
the complicancy to this by the average american amazes me.
one, because aipac is an american organization.
two, the gulf states make israeli lobbying efforts in the usa look like the take-a-penny jar.
yes this is why i'm against lobbying in general, though one wrong doesn't make the other right.
&gt; aipac is an american organization.
well israelis and anyone pro-israel is who runs these organizations to essentially bribe congress, they are strictly pro-israel no matter what, what is the difference?
that’s a little short-sighted, i think.
i mean, you writing a letter to your congress member is “lobbying”.
the right to petition the government for redress of grievances is protected under he first amendment.
civil rights organizations lobby the government.
should they not?
&gt; civil rights organizations lobby the government.
should they not?
not with donations/bribes no, but that's exactly how it all works now.
politicians get elected to fulfill their campaign promises, they then are allowed to take bribes to break those promises/change their position, or just do something that's clearly not in the interest of the people they're representing.
as i'm sure you're aware, being able to bribe policy makers makes the whole process inherently corrupt.
lobbying and political campaign donations are two separate arguments, though.
these aren't campaign donations though, they are made while the senators/congressmen are in office to give a certain vote on bills, etc.
best example - even now aren't senators being paid donations to pass the repeal of net-neutrality?
at the benefit of telecommunication companies only, at the clear loss of the people the senators/congressmen are representing?
this is the kind of bribery i would like to see gone.
aipac takes advantage of this the same way to get politicians to vote in favor of israel, at the clear benefit of isreallis and israel only, at the loss of american citizens.
what aipac is, is a way for isreallis and those pro-israel to give a couple million to congress, so congress can give a couple billion in american tax money, tons of weapons, and veto power to israel.
you would not be against this?
you do realize that there are more jewish people living in the us than there are in israel, right?
there are more american jewish people than there are israeli jewish people.
&gt; there are more american jewish people than there are israeli jewish people.
ok though what difference should that make?
bc people don’t like the notion of foreign governments having any sway in our politics, when they clearly do.
here’s a brand new idea, let israel decide for itself.
it if wants to continue on its present course then fine, but don’t expect us to bail them out.
that’s their bed, let them lie in it.
now we're going to get constant articles of attacks from palestine to israel even tho they have been happening for ages.
lol, when real terrorist attacks happen in israel, they get very little coverage.
but if some rockets were shot a day after trump said something about israel, even if they hurt no one and fall inside of gaza, they get to the front page.
the problem with palestine(as per my limited understanding of the situation there) is that after every war, the citizens have a choice to realign their paradigm about the political organization in power.
rather than blame their elected leaders for the war(diplomatic discussions vs rocket firing, their government really seems to have its head on straight), they play victimitus infinitus, placing all blame squarely on israel.
they had a chance to change things after the war, focus on rebuilding, reeducating, re-electing officials that want to maintain good relations with israel(you can't always force your way in negotiating when you're at the bottom, but you sure can negotiate a good deal) instead, things are now going down the same track to another war.
guess who they'll blame for the war?
&gt; as per my limited understanding of the situation there yeah... i would suggest getting a better understanding.
israel has literally prevented the legislative branch of the pa from meeting since the 2006 election, because israel didn't like the results.
the pa is not a government, it is nothing more than an administrative body that israel uses to enforce the occupation as cheaply as possible, while those in the pa line their pockets.
in all practical respects, the palestinians don't have access to any government, let alone the ability to reform one.
fatah and the pa are nothing more than kapos.
&gt; yeah... i would suggest getting a better understanding.
israel has literally prevented the legislative branch of the pa from meeting since the 2006 election, because israel didn't like the results.
not true at all.
[hamas and fatah are both using the defunct legislative council to settle political scores with the palestinian authority president](https://www.timesofisrael.com/mahmoud-abbass-parliamentary-headache/) [gaza power-sharing deal moves ahead with parliament meeting](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,l-4995307,00.html) [palestinians hold local elections in west bank but not gaza](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palestinians-politics-election/palestinians-hold-local-elections-in-west-bank-but-not-gaza-iduskbn189066) &gt; the pa is not a government, it is nothing more than an administrative body that israel uses to enforce the occupation as cheaply as possible, while those in the pa line their pockets.
in all practical respects, the palestinians don't have access to any government, let alone the ability to reform one.
pure conspiracy bs.
if fatah was being controlled by israel, then why do they regularly incite violence and murder towards israeli civilians?
[in washington, terror attack focuses lens on pa incitement](https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-washington-terror-attack-focuses-lens-on-pa-incitement/) [ on pa televison, young kids incite to violence against israelis](https://www.timesofisrael.com/on-pa-televison-children-incite-to-violence-against-israelis/) the fact that palestinians are unable to take responsibility for any actions whatsoever is precisely why they do not have achieved statehood to this day.
&gt; not true at all.
completely true.
after a hamas-affiliated party won a plurality in the plc elections in 2006, israel prevented the body from ever meeting again with a quorum, arresting dozens of the elected officials, and preventing others from travelling from the gaza strip to the west bank for legislative sessions.
hell, even your own, biased sources recognize that the body is "defunct" and that dozens of its members are in israeli prison.
&gt; if fatah was being controlled by israel, then why do they regularly incite violence and murder towards israeli civilians?
first, because they don't.
second, the things they do say, about resisting israel's occupation, are necessary to keep from being run out of town on a rail.
everyone -- including hamas -- recognize the pa as the sole entity empowered to conduct peace negotiations with israel.
third, the fact is that israel arms and trains the pa to enforce the occupation, and works hand in glove with those security forces.
as kapos, they can rely on the backing of the occupation forces, and on being the best armed force other than the idf.
being kapos has earned the pa and its members wealth, power and guns, and all they have to do is betray their own people on a daily basis to fleece millions of dollars (or in the case of arafat, billions of dollars) as part of the occupation's enforcement mechanisms.
&gt;after every war, the citizens have a choice to realign their paradigm about the political organization in power this couldn't be further from the reality of their situation.
the very goal of isreal during every war is disempowerment.
the goal is to give palestinians as little choice as possible to do anything that gives them ability to change their conditions.
assume for a moment the most violently revolutionary element of palestine was allowed to thrive.
this is the horrible scenario for israel.
(and to be fair a terrible scenario for palestine as many would be slaughtered) assume for a moment the most peaceful element of palestine was allowed to thrive.
the palestinian people organize, resist in mass in a prolonged demonstration that exposes the brutality israel subjects them to and paints the israeli occupation as the apartheid horror that it is.
it gives palestinians international support to their cause.
this scenario is even worse for israel from their perspective.
for them, their best result is the current result: maintaining a brutal status quo where the palestinians are powerless as they are slowly ethnically cleansed from israel's expanding borders.
this is incorrect, i feel, in how you have interpretted these events.
to come out clean, im not the greatest fan of isreal.
they have been reckless and really brought this problem opun themselves by invading and settig colonies all over the west bank.
the palestinian people are largely being persecuted and oppressed.
all the far right leadership(of isreal) does is wave the holocaust in everyones faces.
that was tragic,but we should have moved on.
trump acknowledging jeruselum as the capital was xompletely unnessecary and only escalates the violence and conflict in this area.
still of course, the palestinians terrorists shouldnt be firing rockets at isreal.
i just think that isreal is a very complex issue.
so...given that gaza is super densely populated.
and they fired out of gaza towards israel...but did not reach israel - does that mean that the two rockets fell into gaza?
did...did they just fire on themselves?
this happens a lot actually.
[these](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/qassam_rocket) aren't quite as reliable as tomahawk missiles in terms of reliability or accuracy.
ahem.. hey mr. abbas.
the guys firing the rockets from gaza are part of your new-and-improved palestinian government.
remember?
their name is hamas in case you forgot.
you made a huge unity deal with them a couple months ago.. remember?
israel's [iron dome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iron_dome) defense system is really effective this one particular incident sounds like the rockets just failed; launched from the gaza strip, landed in the gaza strip.
**stop hitting yourself** can we not.
[removed] [deleted] this is a pretty racist statement.
you basically state that once trump said what he said, these arabs in gaza *had to* fire rockets, it's automatic.
you are depriving them of any free will to either fire or not fire the rockets.
they are human beings with their own agency, not trump's puppets.
your comment is also disgusting on a another level... it's like those who say to a beaten wife "it's your fault, you should have kept your mouth shut".
simply disgusting.
i'm going to also mostly disagree with julius_beesar's comment, but what they said isn't racist...to be honest, we all have no clue what spurred them to fire the rockets in this instance.
we can obviously make assumptions, and having the opinion that trump's recent comments regarding relocating the us embassy to jerusalem isn't a bad guess to why these rockets were fired when they were.
i'm not arguing against stating a probable cause and effect, e.g.
without trump's statement, hamas probably would not have fired these rockets.
but the esteemed /u/julius_beesar straight out blamed this on trump, which robs arabs of any free will.
don't you see the difference?
simple example: you went out at night in a bad neighborhood, in provocative clothes, and promptly got raped.
the simple cause for the rape is your own actions, right?
but blaming the rape on you would be wrong, just as wrong as blaming trump for these rockets.
no, i fully agree that the simplistic comment by /u/julius_beesar robs these terrorists of their free will by solely blaming trump.
two parties can share blame.
the trump administration performed an action knowing the inevitable consequence.
a good point would be that a peace deal that everyone's decrying.... that could have been destroyed by trump's actions.... the arabs have had decades to come to an arrangement and they never have... so i don't think recognizing the only legitimate democracy in the middle east is necessarily a bad idea... for the rockets being fired?
what logic is that oh please you know exactly why the rockets were fired, if this dumb shit didn’t do what he did this would not have happened &gt;israel vs. palestine &gt;&gt;rockets fired &gt;&gt;&gt;would not have happened try again good sir.
&gt; if this dumb shit didn’t do what he did this would not have happened not a trump fan in the *least*, but this statement is just obtuse.
[palestinians have been firing rockets at israel for years.
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palestinian_rocket_attacks_on_israel) not a combine harvester fan in the least, but these days when someone starts a comment with "not a ... fan, but" it makes me think you **are** a fan.
not to detract from your point, just giving my perspective.
as for the current situation.
the us knows this will provoke a response as does most other countries.
it's why no one else minus the phillipines?
are openly supporting the move.
whether the move is right or wrong, i think trump is to blame for the resulting violence not because i have a soft spot for palenstinians or muslims, or that the offenders should not face consequences, it's more that **trump does not given one shit about any of it apart from how it deflects attention away**.
i don't think he cares beyond optics, who cares if isrealis get mortar'd?
easier for him to gain support for whatever he does next.
it only serves to fuel violence and extremism on all sides and all for trumps political capital.
of course, my opinion on the matter.
hopefully it might hit abit closer than they guy aboves point.
don't get me wrong, i think this was a dumb and scummy move by trump.
i don't approve of it, or much of anything that he says or does.
however, no matter how much i despise someone/their actions, i still try to look at things fairly when judging them.
i get where you're coming from too.
(and i get where palestinian anger is coming from as well.
i personally have very mixed feelings about the israel-palestine issue.)
it's just at the end of the day, i don't think someone's stupid/bad behavior somehow justifies someone else's bad behavior.
palestinians have been firing rockets at israel for a long time, for various reasons, and they will continue to do so as long as this conflict/current situation remains unresolved.
their goal is clearly to scare/maim/kill israelis.
they do that by their own will, and in this case, not out of any necessity.
i can see palestinians feeling like they need to push back against israel for offences israel has committed against the palestinian people.
but this case has nothing to do with israel except for israel existing in a way israel wishes to exist.
any palestinian anger over that is completely on themselves and their opinions/feelings.
that's why i don't think it makes sense to say it's trump's fault these rockets were fired.
i do agree that he isn't doing this out of care for the israeli people and that he is probably deflecting attention from his crap - that is scummy.
but at the end of the day, all he did was make a show of support/affirmation for israel.
regardless of whether that is right/wrong/good/bad/dumb though, palestinians lashing out violently against israel in response is palestinians starting shit, not trump.
edit: i didn't realize until after posting that you're not the same person as the previous comment.
also, for the record i do appreciate both the dialogue and your points/perspective.
why are these rockets any different to the rockets that have been fired in the past?
was peace in the middle east established?
i didn't get that memo.
so you reply to something someone said or did with rockets?
i mean if those rockets had killed civilians would you still be justifying it ?
this is the equivalent of saying people don't kill people, guns do here comes the model un warriors from high school to debate this on reddit.
[removed] like kids playing on a beach hamas rockets sometime fail and land in gaza..killing their own ppl and blaming it on israel.
example - hamas rockets hit an hospital in gaza and killed 11 kids [‘misfired hamas rockets’ killed children in gaza'](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/misfired-hamas-rockets-killed-children-in-gaza-r0xllf679pc) [us expert: hamas, not israel, killed boys on beach in gaza war](https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/news.aspx/197710) [who killed the four boys on the gaza beach?
](http://www.thomaswictor.com/four-boys-on-the-gaza-beach/) israel also never claimed they intentionally targeted that beach edit: i'm pretty sure that's the reason the idf now announced this latest rocket salvo.
to say "look up !
it's hamas !
not us, and if someone is dead it's on hamas" since i'm sure you won't hear about it if those rockets will land in israel since no one cares about dead israelis because fuck israel right ?
actually, hamas hides their rockets under schools, hospitals, so israel is forced to fire on them.
a while ago, israel hacked into the tv network, and had letters airdropped telling the civilians to evacuated because hamas had missiles underneath their areas (even homes).
hamas forced these civilians to stay, and thus we get the media "news" of israel "targeting civilians".
yes, cases like out in the open do occur, however it obviously is not their intention.
it costs a lot of money to fire these weapons, they would not waste them purposely targeting children.
that is what hamas and other terrorists do.
gonna be a rough weekend over there.
nah, it's business as usual.
if someone here has crayons, please colour me surprised.
there's recently been a huge crayon shortage after the dod purchased about $400 mil worth of crayola.
they have now fully replaced mres as the #1 source of food for marines i'm all out of orange.
&gt;the idf confirmed two rockets were fired from the gaza strip toward israeli territory.
the rockets did not make it to israel and landed in the gaza strip itself.
that's the entire article.
really.
and it happens every other day too... but when a real terror attack happens, it doesn't get any attention.
darn it... they were so peaceful before president trump.
it's the religion of peace after all!
this is all trump's fault that they are so suddenly, and completely out of character, violent.
remember everyone, *according to this subreddit*, this is trump's purposeful doing so he can execute his master plan: &gt;goad them into violence towards americans, which trump will call an act of war, so the us has an excuse to level the palestinian territories with bombs until they elect a us backed government and sign a peace agreement.
https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7i2oh1/while_jared_kushner_is_working_on_a_peace_deal/dqwhaws/?context=3 yeah, i wouldn’t use horseshit to make a point.
[removed] there are near 5 million arabs settling on stolen aboriginal land in the usa.
somehow, someway, everyone on this planet is a settler.
how far do you want to go back in time is the question.
long live israel arabs in egypt, lebanon, syria, iraq etc are all, also, sitting on stolen land.
the main different is the jews did not commit genocide to take theirs back.
just ethnic cleansing.
i'm assuming you extend the same grace towards israel as you do canaanites then?
have you met a canaanite in the last 3300 years?
or moavian ?
or filistian ?
to clarify, this has nothing to do with trump.
low life terrorists launching homemade rockets might not even know who the guy is.
man, these palestinians are so incredibly stupid... did they get the rockets from north korea?
they make them in their basements using [sugar and fertilizer](https://wikivisually.com/wiki/quassam_rocket).
mission accomplished.
two rockets fired from gaza, hit gaza how is there ethnic cleansing when the arab population has tripled in the last 70 years?
"i don't know why they hate us" maybe, just maybe, because of the consistent land grabs and settlements that slowly eat away at any prospect of a future palestinian state?
the israelis have only taken something like 4% of the west bank and only intend to keep settlements that are contiguous to israel and will swap empty israeli land equal to the 4% taken.
any peace agreement would leave palestine with the same amount of land.
how could that possibly impact palestinian statehood?
if we go by that logic would you be open to trading %4 of your land in an oil field for my 4% of land of landfill?
i would happily trade 4% of my land if that means i have peace and religious freedom.
as a christian from the middle east, i wish we had that choice when the arabs invaded.
it was either pay a lot of gold, or convert or die.
dont even try to paint the israelis as bad.
they are treating arabs way too leniently in my opinion.
which just proves that they are not at all a peaceful or reasonable people.
it's up to the palestinians to negotiate for land of equal value.
it's not like any of the land taken has any valuable resources.
in either case how can 4% of land make palestinian statehood impossible?
"it's up to you to negotiate a return on the stuff i stole from you" land value there is more about fertile soils and water access vs rocky hills afaik.
and its more a matter of principal; palestine doesn't want to negotiate for 4% of land that 70 years ago was 100% palestine land.
70 years ago it was british land where they let people live on it.
it was never their land it was the ottoman empire then the british empire then the jordanian dictatorship.
now they have to negotiate for statehood which requires land agreements with israel.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and its more a matter of principal; palestine doesn't want to negotiate for 4% of land that 70 years ago was 100% palestine land.
how much blood is this 4% worth?
people regrettably don't feel any sympathy for the palestinians nah they do, but pro-israel shills brigade threads *hard* when they come up, every pro-palestine comment here is immediately below -10. it's literally propaganda.
of course, it's completely impossible that people would disagree with the actions of terrorists.
they must all be shills, right?
who could possible be against a group with the stated goal of committing genocide?
yeah.
i noticed that!
it doesn't match reality.
they're probably all bots.
i'm a pro-israel shill.
i'm not a bot ^(^this ^action ^was ^performed ^automatically) .
if someone's triggered enough to launch missiles at innocent civilians because israel's capital is "officially" jerusalem, then they can go fuck themselves.
i understand disaffection, but slinging rocks (which if you know your history, kills people), burning tyres and launching rockets is not the way to go.
nope, if you check their comment history you notice that it's just a mix of nationalists, theists and racists (sometimes overlapping).
expected after the bone headed move yesterday, but still pretty abhorrent.
i wonder if the plan all along was to provoke the palestinians to help netanyahu's government deal with all their scandals at the moment.
either way, they made that unilateral move knowing full well that both palestinians and israelis would die over it.
you're acting as if palestinians haven't been launching rockets at israel for a decade now.
i'll still remember the youtube video showcasing israel's iron dome missile defense system.
in the video, you could see israelites filming the missiles on their phone.
somebody in the comments had the audacity to say "look how fucked up this is!
israel is killing palestinians and they're just filming this on their phones like it's a fireworks show!"
it's like... you do realize palestine is the one launching those rockets, right?
it's not as if israel was unprovoked.
this sadly might just be the beginning of many more unfortunate incidents to come due to the trump announcement.
25 were already injured in protests around the country, it's a matter of time before somebody dies, i really hope this doesn't snowball into another intifada or gaza war (or honestly, if we take everyone at face value right now: both).
one protester is already in a critical condition from live fire being used.
trump already has blood on his hands from the dramatic increase in number of civilians killed by targeted strikes in syria, but yesterday's announcement will surely trigger much more.
i don't understand why the need to do it in the first place, it wasn't exactly a pressing issue.
to recap: muslim attacks shouldn't affect immigration policy.
if they do, then we're letting the terrorists win.
muslim attacks should influence where the embassy is.
thank you.
there are certainly foreign policy and diplomatic reasons for not doing this, but terrorist threats should not be used as justification.
international law, peace process, diplomatic pressure, pr, risk of unrest, destabalising effect.
there are countless reasons as to why this was dumb.
what good reason was there for this aside from making the right wing israeli goverment happy?
that doesn't explain the need to change it.
it's deliberate provocation.
what if these bombs are fake?
to give any reason, any justification to invade gaza?
what would be an acceptable form of protest for israel?
what if the palestinians asked nicely?
these rockets are nothing but flairs of desperation, they have never been any serious threat except in the exaggerated claims of israeli news.
tell the people who've [died or been injured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palestinian_rocket_attacks_on_israel) in these attacks that these rockets are no serious threat.
when someone come to your house and shoot your wife remember its flairs of desperation!, those rockets killed before this is why i moved the american embassy.
to jerusalem.
where its safe!

not just a regular shambles, but an utter omnishambles.
from bean to cup, you fuck up!
brexit : n : a situation that is such an utter shit show that you can't imagine it getting any worse, and then it does.
murphy's law: "hold my drink" imagine what it will be like when it actually happens.
this isn't your average, everyday ordinary shambles.
this is... advanced shambles.
a fully fledged, gold-embossed cockup.
even the shambles are in shambles.
time to fire up the shambotron but those are very strong and even more stable shambles!
as frankie boyle put it, our brexit negotiation team would pay full price on a dfs sofa.
no,clusterfuck.
you can write "piss" on the internet.
you can, of course, but that's how the site's headline had it written up.
you can't say piss on the radio.
only on the television i bet you they won't play this song on the radio only christian radio maybe oh flip, oh gosh, oh golly gee... you can say piss, fuck, dick, dickhead, shit and more on tv in australia.
you are also supposed to follow the rules of the subreddit and not change the title of the article.
it checks out: https://i.imgur.com/hlmt55r.png okay.
i was trying to think of a curse word starting with p, but is only 4 letters.
i was just here because i wanted to know what word it was.
never occurred to me that "piss" was bad enough for the censors.
piss.
yup, it works.
pissed = drunk, pissed off = angry and of course gnats piss = a low quality, weak beer american beer is the politically correct way to say it american beer is like having sex in a canoe: it's fucking close to water.
i assume you think bud light is representative of american beer, but do you have any idea how many hipsters per capita we have?
i have probably 100 craft breweries within an hour of my house.
unfortunately "american adjunct lager" is a thing, and it's the thing that the rest of the world thinks of as "american beer".
bab=bastardized american beer.
this guy gets it.
piss up = occasion at which you get pissed pissed on = president takin' the piss = boris johnson taking the piss surely?
had to come to the comments to find out what 'p***' is suppose to be.
i can't belive piss up is a british saying, thought it was known world wide!
aussie and kiwi to.
but i guess we are like mini britton you guys are down there for having too many piss ups canada as well.
everyone knows this saying.
the only time i had heard of "piss up" was a daniel tosh joke about doing push ups after using the bathroom as a beginning to a workout program.
called them piss ups.

yeah but why censorship of 'piss' since the whole phrase is 'piss up' which has nothing to do with urination, but i guess some media outlets are just such prissy p***ies.
i'm canadian and this is the first i've heard it.
although it does make sense, i don't recognize it.
same here, i grew up in ontario, moved to alberta-- this is the first time i've heard "piss up" as a term.
i'm pretty sure those are the only countries.
sounds weird in any other accent, imo never heard this in the us.
initially i was confused as to why "push up" was censored.
but they could organize an orgy in a nursery.
excuse me good sir, this is not *alabama*.
alabama here, we'd build a wall around roy moore but we're kept too poor to afford it.
they have experience from jimmy saville when he worked with children’s hospital charities.
uhhhhhhhhhh?
oooooooooooh!
ewwwwwwww.... well, he's not wrong and to think it's all going down in belgium, with more breweries than you can shake a cock-up at.
that's the most british insult i've ever heard eli5 for any brit present: why do they call it a "piss up"?
every time i hear his name i think i've heard 'ed miller band', and wonder who they are.
ditto.
then i wonder why a band is being asked important questions like this.
steve's less talented brother.
they're a not-so-great wedding/bar mitzvah band.
i wouldn't recommend booking them.
a push up?
learned what a "piss up" is.
i thought i had a decent understanding of british slang for being from the us.
this makes me wonder now.
also, no one has left the eu before, there was no procedure in place to do so.
it seems reasonable they're making it up as they go because they are.
what previous standard is there to compare it to?
is this just political blustering or am i missing something?
edit: thanks to all replying.
i had no idea it was *that* shakey.
nah, they're legitimately screwing it up.
for example, it's been over a year now since the brexit vote happened but the uk government hasn't done a single impact assessment on brexit.
not one.
they literally have no idea how this is going to affect their economy, farming, food production exports, nothing because they have not done any impact assessments on any quarters.
one of their mps said he didn't believe in things like that.
(can't remember which.
david davis maybe idk.)
another example, there was a deadline(one of many) on the ireland-northern ireland border issue this week where may and varadkar (irish taoiseach) basically pretty much agreed on a way forward, but then when word of this got back to the dup (who bolster the fractured tory government) they pitched a fit and may had to roll back on her promise.
she never consulted with the dup first, despite needing their support.
cue accusations all around, may blaming the dup, the dup blaming ireland etcetc.
i'm just hitting the tip of the iceberg here.
there seems to be general incompetence all over the british government and it's making people wonder if they just want a hard brexit.
because they can't be just this stupid.
tl;dr it's not so much they're not meeting a standard so much as they're not doing anything.
the ireland-northern ireland border has seemed to me a very hard thing to organise either for a soft or hard brexit.
and dangerous because it could reactivate a long and bitter conflict.
yet they seem to have spent most of the time squabbling about the so called brexit bill and got to this very hard question close to the deadline.
probably because money is something they love to talk about while tough political problems give them headaches.
thing is this was explicitly raised in the referendum campaign and the leave campaign in the shape of [boris johnson](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-35692452) said the border would be "absolutely unchanged".
yet another brexit lie.
since the eu was fundamental in bringing the good friday treaty, it will be hard to blame them if it breaks down.
painting them as greedy has a long tradition, though no it'll be very easy to blame the eu.
stupid, but easy.
yes.
"it's eu fault" "why" "curved banana" typical brussels bureaucrats.
not just no impact assessments, but they're continuously going back and forth with their claims.
they've claimed they have "50-60 highly detailed assessments", then they turn around and claim no assessments exist, presumably so they don't have to release said assessments and reveal how moronic they are.
&gt; one of their mps said he didn't believe in things like that.
what the genuine fuck uk?
please let scotland survive.
i love you guys.
&gt; for example, it's been over a year now since the brexit vote happened but the uk government hasn't done a single impact assessment on brexit.
not one.
they literally have no idea how this is going to affect their economy, farming, food production exports, nothing because they have not done any impact assessments on any quarters.
bullshit.
they know what the impact is, and they knew from before they pushed the button on article 50. they just don't *politically* know what a shitshow its going to be - so they can claim ignorance.
the problem is this is obviously going to be such a shitshow, with the eu never going to agree a soft brexit, that they only have the c team involved in this.
nobody smart enough to deal with it properly wants anything to do with it.
they are getting railroaded by smarter people in brussels.
evil people, but smarter.
i think the uk government wants a hard brexit to start with and then once the crisis hits ram through a reasonable deal and be seen as saviors.
a good deal with the eu now will still be much worse than the excellent position the uk was in before, no politician wants to take the blame for that.
close, david davis is actually the secretary for brexit:) well, the dup backing out came as a surprise to may... after all she did bribe them to shut up and let her have her way.
isn't an impact report something that would be done before voting to go ahead with it ?
the people have spoken, they don't want none of this elitist "report" twaddle.
they want to pull out and fuck the consequences.
there's an excerpt floating around of tony connolly's (irish journalist) book ob brexit and ireland about how before the vote the irish government started doing impact assessments and planning.
i really don't understand it, surely every day since the referendum, and certainly every day since triggering article 50, the big focus in the british government must have been on brexit and how they're going to do it.
there must be thousands of reports, memos and plans to draw upon, yet they couldn't?
the brits thought the eu would come crawling to them asking them to stay, "if you stay we'll give you this good deal!
", but what's happened is "if you, as a non-eu country, want to have trade relations with the eu, we'll have to settle the unpaid dues you've accumulated as a eu member, and we want this and this and this."...
the brexiters think the uk is still a superpower that countries would love to deal with, but the reality is smacking them in the face.
and the eu is majorly shafting them to show to the other member countries, "if you leave this club, you will be a poor country with no advantageous trade deals, so don't even consider it...".
they even want to leave the jurisdiction of the european court of justice, but the eu said those rights have to apply to eu citizens, if they try to shaft eu citizens, they could make life harder for uk citizens in the eu (e.g.
retirees in spain), for example by needing visas and proof of income before getting said visas.
imagine droves of retirees returning back to your country, demanding their welfare.
in any case, the government has no plan of survival, the eu has been able to dictate the terms, at the end it will either be "we're not in the eu but we have to follow all the rules to gain access to their markets, so nothing has changed (still free movement of people and goods) except we have no say in those rules.." or the may government is ousted and labor also goes for a deal similar to that.
even switzerland which is not in the eu but in the efta has freedom of movement, any eu citizen that shows up with a job contract from a swiss company gets a permit to stay, none of this "is there a local who can do the job?"..
they probably won't wake up until they see the deal the us puts on the table, and notice that the us uses the same negotiation tactics the eu does, i.e.
"sign here."
a good deal of the value of the "special relationship" to the us government was britains access to the eu, after all.
trump already said the uk will be at the back of the line when it comes to new trade talks.
there isn't much left of that "special relationship" between the two countries.
spot on!
nope.
as a lot of people reasonably predicted they're fucking the entire thing up.
(even worse than expected if anything).
whilst you could make an argument for having to "make it up as you go along" due to a lack of precedence any possible consequential result *still* depends on having a solid understanding of the underlying system you're attempting to separate.
this isn't happening in the uk because the elected government doesn't understand or even give a shit about how the uk's economy really functions and how it relates to europe.
they don't know what they're supposed to be separating or how and david davis (the mp in charge of the process) is such a lazy cretin of a man he hasn't even bothered his ass finding out.
in nz we call a drinking session "a piss up", getting drunk is "getting pissed" and drinking alcohol is often "drinking piss."
so if someone invites you around to their place to drink some piss with the boys, you can be sure that it's *probably* alcohol that will be served.
i've always wondered why people from aus and nz call it piss, sounds weird man, i don't wana drink piss it's cause the beer's so shit (or was) e.g.
"it tastes like piss" *carries on drinking anyway cause it's all there is to drink*.
my wasted youth, watneys red barrel... couldn't organise a piss up in a brewery has a fine old place in british vernacular.
for example, i was invited to the christmas do of a not so reliable work supplier last year and i asked them if i should bring my own hip flask if i wanted to get drunk.
they didn't ask me again this year.
your british english is a bit naff m8.
don't worry though we've got you.
&gt; i thought i had a decent understanding of british slang something i have learned, the british will confuse the ever loving fuck out of you, no matter how much a foreigner tries we'll just up the ante.
&gt;"piss up" lifelong anglophile, first time for me as well you should get out more, or as we say, 'get on the piss' = to have a drinking session.
:) oh, i haven't been to britain since i was 2.
(thanks, mom and dad.
you couldn't wait ten years until i would remember?)
if i went out drinking more, i'd get less exposure to you guys, not more.
thanks though.
honestly what are the asterixes covering up?
pint?
pussy?
piss.
no, seriously.
he is saying they couldn't organise a piss up in a brewery.
piss.
it says piss.
is it just me or is the british government trying to sabotage brexit even after the population voted for it?
are we sure they are smart enough to sabotage it and not just stupid?
milibantz strikes again i think the problem is they all know it's going to be a disaster so no one wants to make any policies around it because those policies and policy makers will be held to blame.
so no one does anything.
it's like being the bomb disposal guys on a bomb that is going to blow up no matter what wire you cut but the one who cuts the wire will go down in the reports as the asshole who blew everyone up.
to be fair, ed milliband couldn't organize a piss up at an actual piss up.
piss?
brexit means breakfast, specifically, dogs.
with his past i wouldn't talk much... ed milimeme &gt; milibanter ftfy a pussy up in a brewery??
what does that even mean did someone just switch ed miliband back on again?
blah blah blah sandwich.
ed miliband still exists?
i guess the only question that remains is, what the hell is a piss up?
common british slang meaning to go out on the lash.
i'm gonna need you to explain that one, too.
we in the colonies have created our own dialects and lost touch with the mother tongue.
it means having a sesh.
oh, gotcha they couldn't organise a kegger at a brewery.
"couldn't organise a piss up in a brewery" is actually a common expression in the uk for someone who is incompetent and disorganised.
thank you for reducing my ignorance it means to get rat-arsed, trollied, legless.
i really don't know how i can make it any clearer than that.
can someone please translate that to english?
k thx.
undecided excluded makes this a majority.
47% of people polled excluding undecided.
it's just clickbait.
by that logic, the undecided excluded would imply an even bigger number of people wanted brexit than actually voted for it.
i'm not sure there was an "undecided" option to choose during the brexit referendum.
isn't that done by not voting?
my point is that you can't just say well if they are undecided then their vote (or lack of vote) goes a certain way.
no but there is no "undecided" option in a referendum.
by saying 48% want a united ireland it seemingly implies 52% are against it, but this isn't the case.
48% was the largest percentage and if you exclude the undecided (since that's not an option in a referendum) the majority of decided voters want a united ireland.
forget it, they clearly don't understand the point you're trying to make.
r/ireland are already making preparations for the biggest session the world has ever seen.
it would be really nice to see ireland united.
the past, set aside... irish people need to stop thinking they are vastly different from people from the uk, everyone in ireland watches the bbc and supports manchester united.
i think if the united ireland question was settled once and for all you'd find the irish more amenable to admitting that u/not_a_meerkat tiocfaidh ár lá 26 + 6 = 1 quick mads?
&gt; tiocfaidh ár lá fuck the ira edit: well shit we supporting terrorists and murderers now huh?
&gt; tiocfaidh ár lá this isn't simply an ira chant shouted by irish terrorists sympathisers and idiotic, ira supporting celtic fans.
you should read up on the meaning and use: &gt;[it is now more commonly used by nationalists/citizens who believe in the prospect of a united ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tiocfaidh_ár_lá) yeah it might be now, but you can't shake it's more common use, it's like "allahu akbar".
especially when ignorant americans keep spreading cringy ira meme bullshit without knowing what the fuck they're doing i went to a catholic school just outside of glasgow.
i know all too well about the reference you mean.
it is still used by them, no doubt, but it means a lot more than that to a lot more people than just terrorist sympathisers.
ironically your example of “allahu akbar” is also entirely misconstrued and not at all only used by terrorists, so you’re accidentally arguing against your own point.
just because “ignorant americans” and others (again, kind of ironic) are oblivious to the *much* wider use of words occasionally used by terrorist groups doesn’t mean everyone else needs to stop using them.
&gt; your example of “allahu akbar” is also entirely misconstrued and not at all only used by terrorists no that was exactly my point, the two phrases are used similarly by both terrorists and normal people but are identified with the former, pay attention lad.
wouldn't that make theresa may lose majority in parliament as she had to unite with that xenophobic ni party to uphold her position?
currently she holds 315/650 with ten dup supporting her.
if the ni parliamentary seats were dissolved thered only be 632 seats and no dup to prop her up.
she'd only need one independent to do a deal like the dup had done.
carswell for example is an independent, but he's a former conservative party member good point.
one can hope.
errrm, a poll carried out in roi and only 47.9% wanted a united ireland....... am i missing something here?
that would be like a poll in england on secession of scotland and less than half wanted to keep the union together!
&gt; errrm, a poll carried out in roi and only 47.9% wanted a united ireland....... &gt; am i missing something here?
i'm guessing you didn't read the article.
this was an ni poll.
you should never correct people who don't bother to read an article before commenting.
let them continue on in their ignorance.
not a good call, because then they spread their misunderstanding of the topic to people around them.
yeah, you're right of course.
i can't believe they want to leave just becaose of the bombings they were years ago now consistent history of being fucked by the hard-right leaning english.
yeah, not surprising there'd be a lot of impetus to leave.
not that it will happen.
edit: i wasn't even aware of the "all of ireland join the uk" idea being considered seriously.
damn.
what a jacked up situation.
it's like that girl/guy in high-school that you dated, but they started to make really bad life decisions, and they asked you to come along with them...because...love...or something...and you know they're basically inviting you into shitworld...i mean you can see the big neon "welcum to sh1twrld!"
sign just glaring ahead of them, but you're worried that if you stand up for yourself and tell them "no" that they'll just act even more bugfuck crazy toward you and make life hell anyway... but then seeing england become the redneck shithole neighbor of a modern and prosperous irish eu state would be interesting, wouldn't it?
no one with half a brain in england wants southern ireland to join the uk, honestly mate i would be surprised if the majority honestly cared if the north stays in the uk.
i thought the south was leaving to join the uk after fighting so hard for their independence 100 years ago?
they are being trolled.
thats why they wanted to leave the eu because they wanted to build a second british empire.
south britain is also going to come back once we make them stop speaking french you're a special kind of stupid.
well done.
we're also going to reclaim jerusalem you can't be serious?!
?
i am canadian and not surprised of this announcement.
no, very unsurprised.
trudeau got into office because harper miscalculated by creating the niqab (mostly symbolic) wedge issue to gain advantage on mulcair.
insisting that of course muslim women could wear full face coverings even at their swearing-in for canadian citizenship is what got him into office; he's made it pretty clear what his islam policies are.
yeah cos they have their faces checked by a female officer prior to the ceremony.
except that trudeau has sided with israel is every un vote related to them for his entire term as prime minister.... yeah that’s the only reason people voted liberal: the niqab.
/s you know because we all are sjws who want canada to become moslem and mohammed trudeau doesn't care about the real canadiuns here i was thinking i voted liberal because the last 10 years of conservatives ran the economy into the ground but oh no it’s because i am a secret muslim who is practicing taqueria, mashallah.
&gt; taqueria al-qaeda on tonight, you know my bombs don't lie and i'm starting to feel it's fard all the destruction, my canada bub don't you see justin, this is mandub you're not canadian, or a moron, and probably both.
moving an embassy in jerusalem is a geopolitical issue, not a sociopolitical issue.
hes a sekrit muslem!!
wtf?
most people really don't give a shit about niqabs.
the other issues were way more important during the last election.
namely, widening inequality and the sentiment of the middle class that they were being "left behind" that and trudeau's handsome mug &amp; beautiful mane.
that's what swung the election don't forget this terrible late election game show.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=835uwyldh9s don't forget the promise of election reform and legalization you need to stop reading facebook comments on globe and mail articles you may think thats what got him in, maybe it was important to you, but pretty much a non issue from what i have heard and read.
weed legalization and electoral reform were the big ones, not too mention an electorate that was sick of harper and his mp's (my reason).
the niqab thing was just a bickering point.
this makes less sense than trump's tweets.
this is such an easy game to win.
usa- we are going to do something completely stupid.
*boo* canada- we are not going to do that *cheers* it’s stupid to recognize the capital of an ally?
it is stupid to do anything that hinders the peace process.
are canadians delusional enough to think that a peace process might end with jerusalem not being israel’s capital?
a compromise where east jerusalem is the capital of israel and west jerusalem becomes part of a palestinian state is or was possible.
trump has come out and said the us doesn't recognize any claim to the whole of jerusalem except israel's.
&gt;a compromise where east jerusalem is the capital of israel and west jerusalem becomes part of a palestinian state is or was possible.
trump has come out and said the us doesn't recognize any claim to the whole of jerusalem except israel's.
you have that flipped - west jerusalem is the part that would be considered israeli, and east jerusalem would be part of a proposed palestinian state.
no, he did not say that.
he explicitly said that whether the city is shared or not is up to them, and that the us is open to the idea of a shared jerusalem.
lol yeah, it's up to "them" the country that is literally trapping a peoples in a camp with no independence don't kid yourself...without the usa or some other bigger entity, the palestinians are going to continue to get fucked over by the israelis "them" refers to the parties involved, not just israel.
but you're right to be pessimistic.
jerusalem today is the capital of israel.
why not recognise it?
countries are willing to recognize *west jerusalem*.
israel wants the entire city.
so why isn't canada moving it's embassy to west-jerusalem?
because it needlessly stirs shit.
what would "stir shit" about recognizing the de jure and de facto capital of an ally?
perhaps we should be more concerned with the fragile egos that would be offended at such a procedural issue.
if you recognise that the end result of a peace process is with 'west-jerusalem' being israel's capital - why would this stir shit?
unless.. you recognise that the other side isn't interested in peace and compromise.
and you align with them politically.
i'd respect canada's stance more if they just came out and said 'fuck israel, all of jerusalem belongs to the arabs'.. because at least they'd be honest about it.
[removed] deserves it for what?
stealing palestinian land home by home?
for not getting murdered by the arabs that attacked them and successfully fighting them off at great costs.
for being the only country in the middle east that isn't a steaming pile of shit the eastern half of the city is populated by arabs primarily.
[removed] it used to have large parts of the jewish quarter, but the jordanians razed it and killed or exiled everyone living there.
because of the peace process.... it’s not that hard.
you want to bring both people to the table.
you don’t do that by overtly showing support for one over the other on the issue of disputed territory.
&gt; because of the peace process.
what peace process?
i'm not trying to be sarcastic here.
the palestinians [rejected the last offer for peace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuba4unnj7a) in 2008, which btw included east jerusalem.. and have never (and i mean never) put an offer on the table.
&gt; you don’t do that by overtly showing support you could do it by putting pressure.
in ww2 peace was achieved through unconditional surrender.. do you suppose this won't work in this case?
though if one side has been insistent on maintaining a status quo of privileged negotiations despite their losing position.
upending it has the potential to force them to choose negotiation or lose more.
because israel only fully controls half of it.
israel has control of all of jerusalem except for the temple mount which is under the authority of the jordanian waqf.
israel controls temple mount.
the jordanian waqf runs the mount administratively and religiously, but israel is responsible for security, and trumps the waqf when their interests do not align.
israel limits entrance to women and the elderly when tensions arise, enforces when tourists/non-muslims can enter, and puts many boots up there very quickly when shit kicks off.
ultimately, israel just wants quiet.
(i don't mean that as a sweeping political statement, i'm just talking about day-to-day concerns of the security forces).
allowing the waqf to administer the site is the most efficient way to keep tensions down on most days, but make no mistake that israel absolutely has final say, (and eyes), on *all* of jerusalem.
two interesting anecdotes: 1. in 67 during the war, when the old city and temple mount were captured, the military rabbi (later chief rabbi of israel, name escapes me), led troops to the top, raised an israeli flag, blew a shofar, and prayed the kaddish.
he was swiftly ordered down directly by the chief of staff in order to not kick off a much larger regional religious conflict.
2. they say (later to be pm) ariel sharon visiting temple mount is what kicked off the second intifada.
tensions had been rising since the breakdown of the oslo negotiations, and by the turn of the millennium, israel/palestine was a pile of dry sparkler dust on an arizona summer day.
sharon visits temple mount.
cue protests and rock throwing.
cue tear gas and rubber bullets.
cue a bitter insurgency with monthly (or more frequent) suicide attacks against civilians and corresponding military campaign to shut that shit down by whatever means, that ultimately claimed the lives of some thousand israelis and some three thousand palestinians.
that isn't true.. israel has been sovereign over all of it for 50 years.
seems like your view is based on misconceptions.
i don't think there's anything wrong with knowing jerusalem will end up israel's, but withholding recognition of that fact until the peace deal.
it can be held back as an additional carrot for an eventual peace deal.
giving the parties everything they want (and will eventually get) takes away incentive to do the hard work of negotiating.
it's the same reason why i think it was a mistake for palestine to have been recognized as a country.
sure it will happen eventually, but the more that's given now, the less that can be given later.
&gt; it can be held back as an additional carrot for an eventual peace deal why is it canada's place to dangle carrots in front of a country 10,000km away?
&gt; giving the parties everything they want israel has been sovereign over that territory for 50 years, while there has never been any sovereign palestinian entity that ruled that territory.
canada is playing with soft power with an ally which shares most of the same values, it's completely unnecessary.
would you find it reasonable if israel promoted an independent state for first peoples where ottawa would be divided?
&gt;why is it canada's place to dangle carrots in front of a country 10,000km away?
that's part of international diplomacy.
it's as much their place as it is their place to participate on the world stage.
&gt;israel has been sovereign over that territory for 50 years, while there has never been any sovereign palestinian entity that ruled that territory.
so?
&gt;canada is playing with soft power with an ally which shares most of the same values, it's completely unnecessary.
it's a token gesture either way so neither choice is "necessary."
the question is what role they want.
do they want to be an arbiter and player in the peace process, or do they want to be a stalwart supporter?
if they're interested in being involved on the world stage, they should be using soft power.
&gt;would you find it reasonable if israel promoted an independent state for first peoples where ottawa would be divided?
i specifically said i didn't think other countries should recognize palestine as a country for the same reason so i don't think i understand your analogy.
&gt; so i don't think i understand your analogy.
... &gt; it's as much their place as it is their place to participate on the world stage that's why i asked whether it would be reasonable for israel to promote/support cessation on canadian territory.. do you think canada would view it as 'part of international diplomacy' or as adversarial?
my point was that the position canada is taking on jerusalem isn't neutral, and i fail to see why they'd take it.
then again, i'm not canadian.. so maybe aligning with arab despotisms is not my interest as much as it is canadian.
&gt;that's why i asked whether it would be reasonable for israel to promote/support cessation on canadian territory.. they're not promoting anything.
canada shouldn't take a stand on who has a claim to the territory.
&gt;do you think canada would view it as 'part of international diplomacy' or as adversarial?
why don't you use a real example?
it would have been perfectly acceptable for israel to express no opinion on the issue of the quebec independence referendum, do you disagree?
would you say a refusal to weigh in on that movement is adversarial?
&gt;my point was that the position canada is taking on jerusalem isn't neutral, and i fail to see why they'd take it.
then again, i'm not canadian.. so maybe aligning with arab despotisms is not my interest as much as it is canadian.
how is it not neutral?
refusing to acknowledge it as israeli is different from an affirmative acknowledgement as palestinian.
&gt; would you say a refusal to weigh in on that movement is adversarial?
i think that if israel refused to setup an embassy in a canadian capital because first nations said it belonged to them it wouldn't be perceived as 'refusal to weigh in'.. just the opposite.
&gt; refusing to acknowledge it as israeli is different from an affirmative acknowledgement as palestinian.
instead of assuming as such, go and ask some israelis in /r/israel.
they might have a different view.
my view (i don't live in israel) - refusing to acknowledge israel's capital *is* taking a position against israel.
keep in mind that the question isn't whether you have an affirmative acknowledgement of it as palestinian, simply whether you view it as israel's capital.
if both sides reach an agreement whereby jerusalem is no longer israel's capital, then canada should stop referring to it as such.
arabs will always bitch about israel.
even when the arabs were in control of jerusalem they were still bitching about israel so let's not pretend that jerusalem (a city that the only reason anyone gives a fuck about it is because of the jews) is somehow the thing blocking "peace".
they were "bitching" about stolen land.
make sure you mention that next time you want to spread your bullshit.
no they were bitching because the jews exist.
[they were offered 80% of the land in palestinian area in 1937 by the british peel commision](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/peel_commission.gif).
the jews accepted the division... the arabs turned them down.
in 1947 the palestinian arabs were again offered a 2 state solution by the un.
again the jews accepted the solution and again the arabs rejected it.
just as the 2 state solution was going into effect the arabs league invaded the area with the intent to wipe israel off the map.
israel won.
jordan then annexed and ended up occupying the west bank after the 1948 invasion and they treated the people living there like shit but there was no outcry from the arab community because all they care about is bitching about the jews.
in 1967 the surrounding arab states decided to start pulling the same shit again.
after threatening israel with war egypt and its allies then closed the straits of tehran and mobilized their armies along the border.
instead of waiting for them to attack israel like they did last time israel responded immediately this time and blew the arab armies away.
israel ended up with additional land that they had won in the war with egypt and jordan.
they offered to give the land back to egypt and jordan if egypt and jordan would simply accept a peace agreement.
the arabs refused again.
when israel withdrew from the gaza strip in 2005 the arabs responded by launching rockets at them from the gaza strip.
the arabs in palestine were repeatedly offered their own state multiple times throughout history including at camp david in 2000 and at every occasion they have refused and called for the destruction of israel.
israel is not the one being unreasonable here.
part of the peace process in the eyes of israel is maintaining its capital in jerusalem.
i see no reason why the us wouldn’t support its ally.
your answer betrayed the very problem i am calling out.
israel isn't the only group that matters, for peace to work both sides must be happy.
and this is pissing off the otherside becuase it is violation of the current peace agreement.
you are absolutely correct, both sides must be happy.
israel will not be happy if they are forced to move their capital from jerusalem.
and israel might be forced to accept a compromise where they lose half of jerusalem.
that is not a realistic possibility any more than the right to return.
why not accept reality?
right to return will never happen.
i have no idea why people think it is feasible.
so any person of jewish descent has the right to live in israel even if their ancestors left 1000s of years ago but a person shouldn't get the right to live where their parents and grandparents did decades ago.
how is that logically consistent?
israel has plenty of money and land where it could build a new capital that would be secured, planned correctly and controlled.
better than trying to negotiate with thousands of years of history under every brick in jerusalem.
because there is no significance of jerusalem at all to the jewish people?
"the only people who see jerusalem as significant that matter are jews" this is how obtuse you sound.
context: &gt;israel has plenty of money and land where it could build a new capital that would be secured, planned correctly and controlled.
essentially saying that there is no significance to the city to the jewish people, since obviously they can just build a new capital.
"the only people who see jerusalem as significant *and won numerous defensive wars capturing the city* that matter are jews" fixed that for you.
downvoted without even attempting a response *golf clap* but why should they leave?
it's their city.
or for one side to acknowledge that they are left utterly without any support and accept whatever peace deal is offered them before it get's worse.
america isn't the only country in the world, palestine enjoys support from many countries.
yes.
mostly europeans.
even the gulf arab nations don't support it anymore.
notice that everyone is shitting bricks over this in us and europe ?
notice the deafening silence from their arab cousins?
i haven't noticed a silence or an outcry, as i don't typically peruse mid east news.
let me know how that’s been working out the last 70 years it hasn't been tried in 70 years, but the strategy that was tried (appeasement) isn't working.
so maybe we should end it.
what incentives did the palestinians have to signing a deal when every year they can get more and more of what they want?
i can make peace with a bully by giving him my lunch money too.
it doesn't make it right.
but isn't jerusalem also proof of the significance on how israel took over a place that was well established before zionists?
so it also reflects on the complication on creating israel since it was already occupied by natives and established in the most important capital.
jerusalem had a jewish majority since the mid to late 1800s until 1948 when the jordanians ethnically cleansed the jews from jerusalem, and then again after 1967 once israel captured it.
&gt; jerusalem had a jewish majority since the mid to late 1800s citation needed because of jewish immigration* jews have had a continuous presence in jerusalem for hundreds of years (at a minimum).
including since before islam was a thing.
so sure, they were a majority due to immigration in the same way that the muslim majority which they surpassed was due to muslim immigration.
in this case, yes.
it's totally unnecessary.
how are people so misinformed about this?
it is not capital of israel by *any other country or entity or organization* with the exception of the us and israel.
&gt; it is not capital of israel by any other country or entity or organization with the exception of the us and israel.
this is a factually untrue statement.
russia and czech republic both recognize jerusalem as israel's capital.
adding on: they recognise west jerusalem as the capital, not the whole of jerusalem.
they also call for east jerusalem to be the palestinian capital.
they recognize *west jerusalem* as israel's capital not "jerusalem".
i'm sure you are aware of this.
you are being intentionally misleading.
key part of that reply: “with the exception of israel” would you support russia making a city in crimea their capital?
of course he would...he’s an internet forum conservative...he would suck off putin if he had the chance unfortunately i’m not familiar enough with the situation in crimea to comment on this topic.
name one benefit we get from this that is worth inflaming potential violence.
one tangible thing...saying “but they will like us more” is not a tangible thing.
israel as an ally provides the us with many benefits such as weapons technology as well a real world environment for testing our own weapons tech.
we are already very close allies that work together.
everybody knows that.
that isn't a benefit of this "deal" because we already had that.
what did we get out of this deal?
it’s not a deal, it’s a signal of support to our ally and the us senate voted that it should happen.
we give them billions of dollars, i don't think they doubt our support.
you are right, it isn't a "deal" though because we got nothing in return and further weakened our position with all of the rest of our allies who disagree with this.
it is a loss for us overall...that is what happens when you conduct foreign policy based on emotions and symbols instead of analysis and logic.
military aid to israel has amounted to around $3 billion annually since 2007. that's not weapons sales.
it's given to israel for free.
how is the us benefiting from this exactly?
much of that money is returned to the us via us weapons contractors.
and again, the real world environment for testing our weapons is extremely valuable.
it can't be the capital if israel does not own half of it (unless they plan on stealing east jerusalem the way they stole other land).
i still cannot understand to what end trump is playing.
why now?
why when there are so many other important things happening?
maybe he wants to distance himself from the 'nazi' accusations?
maybe he wants to solidify the evangelical vote?
maybe he wants to do something for kushner so he doesn't speak to mueller?
maybe he wants to distract the media from the mueller investigation story?
i'll go with the last one.
definitely the last one.
i remember it was found out something big happened with the investigation the day that he said he was banning trans people in the military so something huge must have happened to do something like this.
trump actually has a brilliant method of operation.
there's only so much media bandwidth available, and the public can only focus on so many issues at once.
if something is going to shit he'll do something even more terrible elsewhere to draw attention away.
for example, meuller's getting close.
better do something that makes people not care about that for a while.
edit: i'm not sure if i'm getting downvoted by trump supporters upset that i'm highlighting his methods of distraction, or trump haters upset that i used the term "brilliant".
directing attention is actually the one thing the trump administration is really good at.
friend, the scary thing is that in this day, nothing that you said is out of the realm of reality.
if mueller's that close, trump's backed into a corner and he's getting desperate to distract people from the man behind the curtain.
like, war-causing desperate.
2018 is going to suck.
the decision was made now because by a us law passed in congress in 1995, there is an "approval process" that must be made every six months to decide to move the embassy.
trump (like past presidents before him) campaigned on making this move, so when the time came around again, he went through with it.
well, he went through with it the second time, anyway.
the chance to make this move happened once already 6 months ago.
what if hamas attack a us embassy ?
would that give congress motivation to put boots on the ground in jerusalem ?
i'm not american so i'm genuinely curious.
my conspiracy theory senses are tingling haha.
it's easy to come up looking like a great guy when donald is setting the bar so low.
great call trudeau.
canadian government needs to do this more often to show the world we have a voice of our own and we will not do as america says.
being contrary for the sake of being contrary.. sounds pretty idiotic.
it's not being contrary for the sake of being contrary.
the whole world has condemned this decision, even people within the white house.
it seems like trump is being contrary for the sake of being contrary &gt; the whole world has ah.. so everybody else is doing it, and that’s why.
great foreign policy.
"when it seems like everyone around you is being an asshole, it's usually because you are actually the asshole" keep your head in the sand bud, it's been working out great for israel's image around the world thus far.
i mean, your reputation has just been soaring over the last ten years, hasn't it?
oh wait, let me guess, your answer is "who cares what the world thinks?"
bold strategy, cotton.. &gt; everyone around you is being an asshole someone who sees others as assholes shouldn't parade moral platitudes around.
&gt; i mean, your reputation has just been soaring over the last ten years, hasn't it?
of course.. i mean - canada which butchered the natives, destroyed their culture, and now has them in reserves has been suffering dearly for it in the international arena.
oh wait, they didn't.
if israel did the same, do you suppose it would enjoy the same fantastic reputation canada has..?
when the whole world is disagreeing with you, maybe it's time to take a long walk and think things over.

a bunch of despots threaten violence.. that’s it?
this is where you draw your stance?
judging by your comment history, you have clear biases that i'm sure won't lead this discussion in any productive direction so i won't bother.
have a nice day.
i forgot to check his history, but now that you mention it yeah this guy seems like a lost cause.
thanks for saving me some time, guy.
someone has an opinion that's different to mine?
must be a lost cause.
you should read the definition of *bigotry*.
ah.. can't formulate an argument?
might as well attack the person.
pathetic bigot.
&gt; might as well attack the person.
&gt;pathetic bigot.
hmmm i merely drew attention to the fact that you seem to have strong beliefs on this matter.
for example, if i noticed a redditor was a life-long religious advocate, i'm not going to engage in a pro-atheism discussion with them as they are entitled to their opinions and there is no point in arguing for no reason.
are my previous comments hypocritical?
in retrospect, possibly but i assumed that we were both here from a neutral perspective; i am neither american, israeli, palestinian nor muslim.
&gt; i'm not going to engage in a pro-atheism discussion with them who are you going to engage with?
people who share your views?
you'll just find yourself in an echo chamber.
and just to clarify - my view isn't rooted in a religious doctrine.
he didn't say anything bigoted she basically said that because i hold a certain view, there's no chance for a productive discussion.
bigotry - intolerance towards those who hold different opinions from oneself.
the whole world = a handful of dictators.
lmfao!
oh donald with zero experience thinks it should happen because his big donors want it?...awesome foreign policy must be wrong because donald.. is that how reasoning works where you come from?
&gt; being contrary for the sake of being contrary both us and canada had the same stance, then the us changed its stance, which means canada is now suddenly "being contrary for the sake of being contrary"?
get outta here with that logic stuff!
/s i was responding to op who argued that "we will not do as america says" is part of the reasoning.
you're out of context here.
and by the way, the u.s. stance has been different for 22 years.
but you know, screw facts.
don't you know?
the world is supposed to revolve around america.
actually, it's being contrary for the sake of not being idiotic.
that's not why this was done.
but you tell yourself whatever you need to in order to feel better, mm'kay?
mmmaybe you should read the context of the conversation.. mmkay?
pretty much all the important countries that do as america does were against this decision.
what’s your problem that you can’t articulate your position except for saying that everybody else has the same one.
no as you can see most people here agree and most of the international community agrees that trump did not need to do this in the manner he did.
so what is your problem &gt; most people here agree https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/argumentum_ad_populum &gt; so what is your problem you seem unable to formulate an independent thought.
maybe that’s my problem.
thanks for the chat, have a nice weekend.
remember that time he hilariously told refugees in the us that they were welcome in canada?
turns out he wasn't really serious about that.
meh bold move cotton we'll see, won't we.
i don't really like trudeau very much i was neither here nor there on trudeau before this, but this is certainly improving his image in my eyes.
that's all it took?
trudeau is a giant pussy.
what a thoughtful and well reasoned comment you made there.
til deciding not to make a contentious symbolic gesture in a volatile region of the world makes you a "giant pussy".
not recognising an ally’s capital city so as not to upset the arabs.
bunch of pussies.
do you expect a peace process to culminate with jerusalem not being the israeli capital?
canada's stance has long pre-dated trudeau, i don't see how it makes him a giant pussy to not immediately overhaul canada's stance because trump did something.
we have a stance, we don’t know why, can’t explain it, it makes no sense, but there’s a stance and we’ll stick to it!
maybe you’re afraid that recognising jews historic rights will somehow make you owe something to the first peoples.. maybe it’s just to counter us.
god did not magically bequeath that land to them.
i didn't bring god into the discussion.
these straw man arguments are unhelpful.
canada's position is in line with most other countries, including the uk, australia, denmark, france, italy, japan, and south korea.
if israel only had west jerusalem most countries would probably recognize it as the capital.
its occupation of east jerusalem is what is contentious, and since that wasn't even originally part of israel i'm not sure how "historic rights" play into it.
&gt; canada's position is in line with most other countries for canadian's sake, i hope their foreign policy isn't based on [argumentum ad populum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/argumentum_ad_populum).
&gt; since that wasn't even originally part of israel what does that even mean?
was ontario 'originally' part of canada?
&gt; i'm not sure how "historic rights" play into it.
jews are the indigenous populace in jerusalem.
the reason jerusalem is important to christianity is because of jews, the reason it's important to muslims is because of jews, the reason it's important to arabs is because of jews.
the city has been under israeli sovereignty for 50 years now, and has never been under palestinian history.
why does it make sense to divide it?
&gt; for canadian's sake, i hope their foreign policy isn't based on argumentum ad populum.
but you hope it's based on one other country that changed its policy yesterday?
&gt; what does that even mean?
was ontario 'originally' part of canada?
yes?
ontario was created when canada was created.
east jerusalem was not part of israel when israel was created.
&gt; jews are the indigenous populace in jerusalem.
do you think canada and the us should be returned to indigenous people?
palestinians have lived there for over 1000 years, they're not immigrants with lands in other countries, it's their home too.
&gt; the city has been under israeli sovereignty for 50 years now, and has never been under palestinian history.
why does it make sense to divide it?
are you arguing here that any territory occupied by a country for 50 years should automatically be acceded to it?
&gt; you hope it's based on one other country that changed its policy yesterday?
i would hope canadians can articulate their position on the matter.
and i don't consider 'others share my view' as articulation.
&gt; east jerusalem was not part of israel when israel was created.
what was it part of?
as far as i recall it was occupied by jordan (it wasn't part of jordan when it was created).
&gt; palestinians have lived there for over 1000 years palestinierns aren't the [indigenous peoples](http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/5session_factsheet1.pdf), jews are.
the irony is that arabs are there because of arab colonialism.
you wouldn't suggest that the spanish reconquista should be reversed, and that andalusia reverts back to the arabs.
&gt; they're not immigrants with lands in other countries, it's their home too would you argue the same for jews who were born in israel/jerusalem?
&gt; are you arguing here that any territory occupied by a country for 50 years whose territory is it?
ottoman?
british?
because it has never been part of any palestinian sovereign entity.
are you suggesting that a un vote should be able to secede territory from your country and allocate it to another?
&gt; i would hope canadians can articulate their position on the matter.
canada has articulated their position on the matter, it just isn't what you agree with.
&gt; what was it part of?
upon the creation of israel in 1947, jerusalem did not belong to any country.
then in 1949 israel and jordan agreed to divide jerusalem between themselves.
&gt; palestinierns aren't the indigenous peoples, jews are.
i assume you're canadian?
would you give up your home to a first nations person if they said their ancestors owned that land 1000 years ago so it belongs to them and isn't your home?
&gt; are you suggesting that a un vote should be able to secede territory from your country and allocate it to another?
no, merely that military occupation of a territory against the wishes of its local population isn't exactly a strong basis for sovereignty.
in other news: "terrorists to remain untouched in canadian society" this is fine i'm confused by your statement my bad, i thought the "this is fine" meme was well known 'round these parts.
i am sarcastic and totally don't give a fuck about trudeau exploiting trump's "stupidity" especially when he can be dumb and so ignorant himself.
are you canadian?
yes you're mistaken.
he wasn't confused about "this is fine" -- that's a pretty obvious meme -- but about the other part: &gt; in other news: "terrorists to remain untouched in canadian society" please, do explain.
great move canada.
the us is only isolating themselves.
as an australian i would love for my government to suspend our mutual defence pact with trump's america.
fuck getting pulled into some war caused by dumbass american foriegn policy decisions.
like all the liberals on this site love to say, i'm going to say that canada and trudeau are on the wrong side of history because i can dictate what wrong side of history means, just like my liberal brethren.
nobody cares about you canada !
i'm sorry that's funny .
that's fine, more and more countries are beginning to ignore the u.s because it gets bitchy if it doesn't get it's way.
like a spoiled child, which makes sense, the u.s is less than 500 years old, barely out of infancy.
😂😂😂😂 canada is even younger.
you must be one of the special avengers i bet you're triathlon.
hey!
:’( that's nice.
no one really cares about canada, it's 5 million citizens and main exports of maple syrup and beibers.
i mean maple syrup is great, but canada ain't exactly a world power as much as truds would like it to be.
he should focus on being handsome and taking more pics and leave the big decisions to the grownups.
35 million, 10th biggest economy, biggest exports are actually oil and gas, cars, and lumber.
which, presuming youre american by your comment all keep your country ticking.
canadian exports do not keep the us "ticking".
pfft.
10th biggest economy?
you mean 17th?
right.
i think you've drank too much moose urine 'eh.
your lack of education really reflects your nationality and voting sentiment.
i don't mean to stereotype but damn dude.
it doesn't bother me.
i'm somewhat educated, actually.
how does it reflect my voting sentiment?
sounds like you've got america envy.
maybe i'm a self hating canadian?
it's your complete lack of nuance that betrays you.
&gt; maybe i'm a self hating canadian?
doubtful.
anyone self loathing doesn't just come out and admit it unless they're projecting.
more than likely you're a self loathing american.
which leads me to believe that you're not necessarily uneducated, but that you have emotional issues.
"the border violence comes a day after president donald trump recognized jerusalem as israel’s capital.
hamas leader ismail haniyeh called for palestinians to launch a new uprising against israel in the wake of trump’s declaration."
here come the rockets what was any of this in service of?
how has this advanced us interests?
or us ally interests?
or anyone's interests?
i haven't even heard the usual fox news bloviating about "projecting an image of strength" or whatever.
it really just seems like trump felt like doing this today, and his fans are shrugging and wordlessly going along.
my theory is that this stunt is to drum up support for trump's xenophobic policies like the travel ban, the increased tensions a pretense to eventually send the troops, and to serve as a distraction from mueller's investigation and other scandals.
i don't see any legitimate benefit to doing this.
it's all a distraction from his money laundering investigation at deutsche bank....it is the only purpose it serves, just like the 3rd grade name calling of the rocket man - all distraction from the garbage that is in his wake.
[deleted] &gt; the plo cut off diplomatic ties with the us recently, so this is more of a reaction to that if anything.
quite disingenuous from you.
the pa has decided to cut its ties with the us administration *in response to the closure of the plo office in washington*.
i ask again, what interests does this serve?
why did this have to happen today, in such a volatile moment?
why did the former presidents avoid doing it?
"it was on the docket" isn't an answer.
medicine is great but you don't take it unless you're sick.
why did this decision get made and how have we profited?
it was a campaign promise.
it would hurt peace negotiations, but no more than jared’s west bank investments.
so why not get both bits of bad news out of the way?
the damage was already happening and now his base can say, look he did it.
he moved the embassy, he did the muslim ban.
he’s winning.
it's been almost 100 years of volatile moments.. no reason to think it'd change any time soon.
why wait?
why do it in the first place, religious zealots are a danger to the world and i don't just mean muslim ones.
because israel's parliament and government are in jerusalem since 1949... that's the israeli capital.
regardless of religion, it holds the historical heritage of the jewish people.
would you be fine with everyone pretending new york is the capital of the us?
it more akin to the us claiming all of the niagra region it's capital, even though some of it belongs to another country.
that's a bit disingenuous considering palestine isn't a country.
when considering that, outside of the us and israel, it is seen as a disputed territory, it's quite apt.
yeah because fuck people.
it kinda sorta is a country.
the thing about being a country is that its something you do on your own.
there's no stamp of approval to be a country.
if you run your own government and control affairs within your own borders and you are the authority, then you have a country.
the problem is that palestine commits acts of war against its vastly militarily superior neighbor on a routine basis.
they keep starting, and losing wars.
if you're the belligerent in a war and you lose the war you started, you're going to get a raw deal.
don't start hopeless wars.
so while palestine is effectively a country, its a country with some of the most dysfunctional and insane government i've ever seen.
even nk has the smarts to not actually attack any of its neighbors, at least not seriously enough to provoke a real military response.
it will saber rattle all day long, but to attack?
thats madness.
for palestine thats just tuesday.
doesn't it also hold the historical heritage of the palestinians?
because we are currently in a period of extreme unrest with notably islamophobic president whose son in law was caught funding illegal israeli settlements.
thats why you wait.
or at least offer a gameplan.
&gt; how has this advanced us interests?
or us ally interests?
or anyone's interests?
it ends decades of coddling terrorists and forces them to the negotiating table lest they lose more of their wants when support erodes.
&gt; forces them to the negotiating table that's funny cause the article says they're not negotiating.
&gt;coddling terrorists anyone who actually believes that's what we've been doing is retarded.
oh, they negotiated so well during obama's term, it was all roses and rainbows.
not to call you on your claims but that statement seems inaccurate.
unfortunately it's accurate.
by cowing to palestinian demands and refusing to recognize the fact that israel's capital is in jerusalem, we have been contributing to a failed strategy of appeasement that has never worked in the arab world.
[this article](http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/176673/emotional-nakba) discusses why such a strategy cannot work.
uhh.
it’s been repeated multiple times by many past foreign relations leaders.
getting the palestinians to the table is the easy part.
netanyahu isn’t interested in peace.
kerry said this and his predecessors and other heads of states in other countries have said this as well.
what’s happening now is that all this is doing is proving that israel is getting what it wants with no punishment for violating previous agreements.
your head is up your ass if you think israel is interested in talk anymore then the palestinians.
&gt; getting the palestinians to the table is the easy part.
so why is it that they're always the ones refusing to come to the table and refusing peace offers?
because the conditions of the table usually puts the palestinians at a disadvantage so israel with the aid of the “mediator” (usa) can attempt to strong arm the palestinians into giving up more things with no concession from the israeli side.
there is no reason to go to the table at a disadvantage.
one side leaves displeased due to having to give up more than the other side, the peace won’t last.
&gt;there is no reason to go to the table at a disadvantage.
aside from consistently losing wars of aggression.
i wouldn't expect to be on even negotiating footing with someone who is clearly the victor in every conflict.
germany didn't get a white peace with the allies.
&gt; it ends decades of coddling terrorists and forces them to the negotiating table lest they lose more of their wants when support erodes.
finally somebody gets it.
instead of spouting knee-jerk reactions all over the place.
i just want world peace :(( you're currently enjoying one of the most peaceful times humanity has had in thousands of years.
while true, world peace would still be cool with me.
pack it up boys, the quest for everlasting peace is over!
i'll let all the dead syrian kids know, thanks for the heads up!
relative peace in wealthy western democracies =\= world peace nothing you just said disagrees with anything i just said, *at all*.
it's still the most peaceful time in human history if you adjust for the number of people.
instructions unclear, achieving world pence i also want world peace.
are people seriously arguing against world peace now?
if you think by solving the conflict of israel and palestine you're going to have a world peace you are gonna have a bad time.
israel-palestine is one of the smallest conflicts there is in almost 100 years of fighting it's still one of the smallest conficts in the middle east.
the syrian civil war blew past it in only its first few months.
i have a bad feeling that american lives are going to be lost because of this.
no point of surrendering to terrorism.
if american / western lives are lost, we'll wipe out the perpetrators.
what happens when the us terrorizes people?
when the us wrongs a group of people, they don't do anything about it at first but decades later give them some paper and say "we're sorry" before wronging a new group of people.
what other result would there be?
it's the epitome of " a dumbfounded no-thought move".
more thought goes into spraying silly string on your friend when they're blowing out their birthday candles than went into this fucked up declaration.
yeah, that'll ignite.
why?
not one american troop has ever been deployed to israel to fight in their battles.
more hatred = more terrorist attacks.
giving into the fear of terrorism is letting the terrorists win.
having fear and giving into fear are not the same thing.
when you do or don't do things out of fear.. that's giving into fear.
what did i not do out of fear?
more hatred = more terrorist attacks.
seems like an argument to not do anything that might upset a group of people you're afraid will attack you.
how does that justify needless provocation?
it was something nearly unanimously voted on by the democratically elected united states congress in 1995. israel is an ally and peace talks have amounted to repetitive nothingness.
you can call it needless, but this has been israel's stance *forever* and america's stance since 1995. if you are labeling it "provocation", then you are insinuating that you *know* this will lead to terrorist attacks.
hence, your reasoning for not doing same is out of fear of terrorism.
i am simply saying that the threat of terrorism is the wrong reason to not declare jerusalem as israel's capital.
in contrast, if your reasoning for not declaring jerusalem as israel's capital is due to the occupation of east jerusalem, then that is perfectly acceptable to me.
israel goes quite easy towards their settlers who don't care if they are colonizing palestinian lands.
israel nor the palestinian government are making serious commitments towards a stable peace, both don't want to make sacrifices to guarantee it.
idt there's anything western society can do to stop terrorism.
our existence makes terrorists attack... and the warnings from the state dept.
to people in jordan not to send their kids to school etc.
because of the threat of this?
or are they not soldiers so theyre not people?
how is that different from other lives?
not op, but i think the sentiment is: by willingly taking this position, risk of violence against diplomatic staff will likely increase.
you're right that the fact they're americans isn't relevant.
considering that the casualties to stem from this are due to an ill-conceived, bone-headed declaration that has no tangible benefit for the us in any sense whatsoever from a moron whose primary duty as sworn to is to *safeguard* those lives it actually should matter.
trump is painting a gigantic bullseye on every us citizen in the me for no other reason than to dick-wave and pander to a bunch of bible-thumping asskissers who'll already support him no matter what as it is.
not to undermine the non-us deaths that will also occur as a result, but it's the difference between people merely dying because of carelessness and people dying because of deliberate flaunting of diplomatic standards and norms done purely for political points, all of which stems from the person who should be looking out for their best interests.
no different at all!
you're right that if any lives are lost because of that idiot it will be horrible.
thats the gop platform right now.
kill americans.
either with a war, a recession, lack of access to healthcare or infrastructure, a militarized police, guns, in childbirth.
the list goes on.
but execution via poverty isn't illegal, and most of the people in the crosshairs won't accept they're a target.
look i might be downvoted but the violence makes no sense.
palestinans keep their land.
the two state deal is still on, in fact in trumps speech it seems he is committed to it.
its just israel recognising jerusalem as their capital, and putting the embassy in their half.
they arent taking palestinian land?
in fact, muslims have no issue going into the israeli held half of jerusalem, the same cannot be said of non muslims entering the palestinian half.
we need to stop giving into the terrorist blackmail of "do it our way or we will be violent".
no.
the problem is that both sides lay claim to the whole of jerusalem.
until that issue is settled the city should not be recognised as anyone's capital, which infers total dominion.
jews have claimed jerusalem for almost 3,000 years - it's where the first temple and second temple stood, and home to the western wall of the second temple - the only part jews are allowed to pray at.
jerusalem is where jesus was crucified, and the home of the tomb where he was resurrected from about 2,000 years ago.
mohammad is believed to have ascended to heaven from the site of the dome of the rock, and as such al-aqsa mosque was completed some 1,300 years ago.
saying that peacefully settling this issue will take 500 years to accomplish could be considered optimistic.
just for some historical clarification.
why do you state the resurrection as fact but the part about mohammad as believed?
actually, the israeli held areas have no issues regarding religion.
as pointed out above, all faiths can come and go peacefully through israeli held holy sites with no issue.
it is the palestinian held ones that have issues.
i believe if hamas (the agitators) were removed, and a more reasonable palestinian government were elected, we would truly have peace.
think about it, where is hamas getting all these rockets from?
they are spending all this money on weapons instead of their own people.
they are clearly not dedicated to peace, and never will be.
i don't disagree.
i am simply saying that getting all sides to come together and agree to a solution is much more complicated and historically charged than anything americans can understand, and i say that as an american.
yes i understand, i am only trying to put out some ideas and the rationale behind my opinion.
i believe that the decision itself is not bad, it just brings to the surface the nature of hamas.
notice how they did not try to attend the conversation with pence (as trump was clear that he wanted to make both sides happy).
i truly believe removing hamas would help everyone a great deal.
i do not believe the us government would enter into any sort of discussions with hamas at all.
the us government considers them to be a terrorist organization.
however, abbas and the rest of the fatah government not meeting with pence is another story.
that being said, i do remember hamas saying that they would be willing to give up their governing arm in gaza and give their political power over to the fatah party that currently rules the west bank if they would be allowed to keep their militant arm.
i know, i know.
i am speaking in terms of physical land owned by either side staying the same.
also, it was passed in 1995 to name jerusalem as the capital, and have the embassy moved there by 1999 (iirc).
meaning that this, in reality, should have happened long ago.
also, again, trumps speech emphasises the two-state deal and working with both sides.
i know its just words and he often back flips, but that speech really is all we have to go off for now.
i understand your point of course.
maybe if they referred to the capital as "west" jerusalem (the part israel has normal control over), that would be better, and more accurate?
as east is what palestine has.
hardly surprising when the us is so obviously partial to one side in the dispute.
yeah, the nazis weren't big on talking to us either.
do you really think there is moral equivalence?
given that the written, official position of hamas is the destruction of israel "from river to sea", yeah, that's kind of nazi-like.
how dare you slander hamas in this manner for saying they want to drive the jews into the sea!
they clearly only want to slaughter them on the beach.
/s you need to work for a fact checker.
both groups seem to share a goal of exterminating jews so... yes?
seems inaccurate.
the israeli troll brigade is out in full force after trump’s annoucement.
the disinformation is unreal.
because if it wasn't for those troll comments, everyone would agree with you, right?
nobody has contrary views!
some do sure but reddit is heavily infested by trolls lately.
it's pretty much common knowledge at this point i mean, both of em were/are pretty adamant about killing jews bit different.
six of one, half a dozen of the other.
because the palestinians hold all the power over the jews just like the nazis.
and israel is as innocent as the jews were back then too.
/s perfect analogy.
of course the germans also settled already occupied land and pushed out the inhabitants, not dissimilar to israel coming into existence.
so i guess everyone is trying on shades of evil in this situation.
this black and white thinking leaves the evil people in power, it's the fodder for the cannons of conflict.
nobody could have known how complicated middle east peace could be fucking jared is taking too damn long in bringing peace to the middle east too busy building illegal settlements and then lying about it.
seriously, why would they have anything to do with any us administration after this?
they've been lied to and strung along for decades as their land and resources are stolen.
from their perspective i don't think they have any option left but to get rid of all their leaders that have brought them to this sorry state and start an uprising.
unfortunately it looks like tomorrow could be another sad day.
edit: what other options do people think they have?
how about stop shooting middles at israel and chanting death the israel in the streets.
and saying that they will wipe all the jews off the planet... and instead actually try peace.
this move was approved by congress in 1994. the palestinians have been using threats of violence to stop the move ever since.
the real question i have.. why do the palestinians care where israelis capital is?
is it because they think jerusalem is theirs?
or because they don't want israel to exist at all?
i would imagine it's because they don't want israel to control jerusalem.
jerusalem is a holy city to all abrahamic religions and the initial talks, and the current end plan, is jerusalem will be the capital or both states, potentially as a neutral un zone, as mentioned in czech's own statement: in a statement on its foreign ministry’s web site, it said, “the czech republic currently, before the peace between israel and palestine is signed, recognizes jerusalem to be in fact the capital of israel in the borders of the demarcation line from 1967.” “the czech republic together with other eu member states, following the eu foreign affaires council conclusions, considers jerusalem to be future capital of both states, meaning the state of israel and the future state of palestine.” i wouldn't compare the pieces of pipe that are fired out of gaza that hit a field in southern israel to the heavy artillery and munitions israel use to slaughter thousands in gaza.
it was agreed internationally at the un that the final decision on jerusalem would be made as part of the final agreement on partition.
one side has *all* the power in these negotiations and they know it.
this is apartheid, it is occupation, it is colonialism.
best to make deals and try to be magnaminous when you have the upper hand because in the long run all empires fall and we have to find a way to get along and find a tolerable situation for all.
continuing the current colonial goals of israel is creating a future disaster for themselves.
the northern part of ireland was colonized 400 years ago and resulted in 300+ years of fighting.
thats what they have to look forward to if some sort of compromised isn't reached.
&gt; pieces of pipe [gee i dunno...](http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2014_28/556246/140710-rocket-israel-7a_7e4d23f85f92812c20e1392cf85d4d37.jpg) [these are some big pipes](https://www.vosizneias.com/assets/uploads/news_photos/thumbnails/700_t3ui0myhxvqkfwwh5sifiu8nu8dgvsbc.jpg) r/nocontext got a geolocation on those pictures?
top picture: nbc news photo of rocket fired from gaza.
bottom picture: idf soldier patrols in front of display of captured m-302 rockets.
https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/middle-east-unrest/hamas-firing-china-designed-syria-made-m-302-rockets-israel-n152461 that "rocket" fired today didn't even make it over the fence.
a homemade spud gun could fire further than that.
so let them keep launching rockets at civilians until they get it right?
what exactly are you arguing?
is that so?
well, as lucky as that is i don't see what it has to do with the evidence i just posted disproving your claim that gazan rockets are universally without danger.
comparing what israel did with colonization is a big stretch.
i will give you the villages or whatever are not something i agree with.
and are pretty shitty to do.
but do palestinians think that israel doesn't have a right to western jerusalem?
or do they just think that israel doesn't have a right to all of jerusalem?
also this is not apartheid... the only reason that the israelis have all of the security checks is because without them they would be having people blown up and stabbed every single day.. and explosives are explosives.
the technology behind something may affect how effective it is... but they are designed to kill.
and you cannot blame israel for defending themselves.
very few times has israel actually attacked without being provoked first.
the last big one for example.
they went in to gaza to blow up tunnels into israel.
that we're going to be used to attack israel.
its pretty late here and i've a long day tomorrow so not going to get into a big debate about this.
but i've seen the towns and villages that were bulldozed to the ground all the people expelled from where they had lived for generations.
its a strange thing historically that the abused become the abuser and unfortunately for the palestinians, they have to pay for the outrageous crimes that were committed against the jewish people in 30-40s europe.
from my perspective there is a massive disparity in power at play here and the weak have a right/duty to resist tyranny.
personally i believe jerusalem should be a shared capital israeli west and palestinian east but there's is no real chance of that.
even the west bank is so broken up i don't think the palestinian people have anything left to lose.
no one wants this horror show to continue for another generation but there needs to be constructive leadership on both sides and unfortunately its not there at the minute on either side.
yes agreed.
except i disagree that the difference in "power" automatically makes it a tyrannical situation.
and all i can hope.
is that if the palestinians actually come to the negotiating table.
and actually want peace.
then at the end of the process.
israel will, as a show of good faith.
give east jerusalem back to the palestinians.
unfortunately.
i do not see the palestinians ever wanting a 2 state solution.
i believe that there are individual palestinians who would be completely fine with that.
and probably hope for it.
but the extremists in their midst will never allow it.
&gt; from their perspective i don't think they have any option left but to get rid of all their leaders that have brought them to this sorry state and start an uprising.
yes, the palestinian leaders screwed their people pretty hard and they should start an uprising to get rid of them.
america picked sides in this issue and therefore can no longer be a peace mediator.
supplying israel with billions in free weapons wasn't picking a side?
he said america picked sides.
he knows that supplying weapons was picking a side.
he also said "can no longer" as if we could be a peace mediator under obama, bush, etc.
it almost seems like they aren't 100% interested in finding a peaceful solution.
it almost seems like they know meeting with pence is a complete waste of time.
they prefer the rockets.
who can blame them?
sane people.
someone with crayons , color me surprised.
lol but i brought my wife!
she said it’s ok!
just remember guys **blockchain is not bitcoin**.
this is good for blockchain.
**blockchain** is itself being used as a loose term for a variety of implementation of distributed ledger tech - not just one framework of blockchain.
some don't even use blockchain - just concepts borrowed from blockchain probably a good idea to buy bitcoin just to cash out in on the idiots that do think it's the same thing.
now is the time to sell.
you missed the boat on buying by about 3 years if you wanted to become ‘fuck you’ rich... it's been time to sell for years.
i bought a couple hundred dollars worth of bitcoin a few months ago and now i have a thousand.
sold most of it yesterday though, this can't last!
but i'm sure i'll be proven wrong, like countless others before me.
eh, i made a small investment into bitcoin 2 days ago.
made a quick 50 bucks.
not even close to fuck you money, but i'll take it.
it did get me to consider other forms of crypto currency though so maybe one of those will give back a decent return eventually.
who knows?
crypto currencies are a serious gamble if you don't go in educated.
ha!
$50 is at least get drunk enough to say ‘fuck you’ money!
have a look at what the price of it was 3 years ago.
that’s when i first heard about it &amp; regret not buying a few hundred £s worth.
absolutely, you have to understand it or you can get burned pretty badly.
take a look at etherem &amp; do some research.
similar but has subtle differences to bitcoin &amp; is much earlier in its life.
bitcoin has been mined intensely for many years so the processing power that is needed increases every time a new ‘coin’ is created.
which has some impacts on the longevity of it imo.
i actually was looking at ethereum but ended up going with bit, ark, and litecoin.
ethereum is definitely second to bitcoin right now, but i'm aiming for early game;) and oh i know.
i almost bought some in 2012. i regret not doing that every day.
[iota](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/iota/) seems to be the new money maker.
from memory, it was about 6+ years for me :( i decided to invest in a low tech solution (gold / silver).... oh well.
it's just money (he says as a single tear rolls down his cheek).
read up on ark, sia, bch, xmr and ltc.
lots of room for growth.
edit - just saw your comment lower down, good choices lol.
eth is a pretty solid long term investment right now too, and it's probably a better time to buy it than xmr or sia.
i have some faith in omg and neo long term too.
hey thanks, i'll do some research.
btc $500k what!?
i can't hear you over the mad rush to buy bitcoin don't let buttcoiners hear you say that.
a blockchain literally can not exist without some sort of digital, transferable token, i.e.
cryptocurrency.
it does not have to be called "bitcoin", but it must be something which works exactly the same way or at least very similarly.
&gt; blockchain &gt; noun &gt; &gt; a system in which a record of transactions made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are maintained across several computers that are linked in a peer-to-peer network.
https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/blockchain if you find anyone telling you that "blockchain is good, but we don't need cryptocurrencies", you can be sure that they either have no idea what they are talking about or that they hope that you have no idea what they are talking about.
comp eng student here.
this is incorrect.
a block chain is fundamentally just a chain of hashed data blocks such that changing one data block will invalidate the rest of the chain after it.
i’m actually pretty shocked that oxford got this so wrong... block chains are commonly used in p2p networks and store transactions, but they don’t need to be.
perhaps oxford's confusion comes from the process of actually creating blocks with bitcoin.
a blockchain is a trivial concept but decentralized decision making about who gets to create the next block is not.
that is wrong.
you can use a blockchain algorithm to verify regular currency transactions.
first, it could if there were regular currencies working with blockchain technology, but there aren't and there won't be for quite some time.
second, it's not that you can't use regular currencies, although there are pretty big obstacles, it's that you have a huge incentive not to use regular currencies, if you create a service and program it to work only with the cryptocurrency that you have created you have a huge capital created out of thin air, if you program it to work with regular currencies you're giving away a lot of capital you could have owned.
the only way regular currencies will keep being used is if governments coerce everyone by force, but they'll quickly become tyrannical and lose all support they have.
that and good luck coming after users in decentralised global networks.
&gt; the only way regular currencies will keep being used is if governments coerce everyone by force lol, that is so naively wrong it's hilarious.
regular currencies will keep being used because you have to pay taxes in your national currency, and if you dont, you go to jail.
once cryptocurrencies become popular enough, they'll start taxing you for any gains in those currencies, but you'd have to pay in local currency, which means you'll have to buy local currency, which ensures there will always be demand for it, something you cant say for distributed cryptocurrencies.
good luck taxing a decentralised application that is autonomous in the network.
you realize we're not talking about companies here right?
you can't close down or sue a dapp... why don't you try suing bitcoin?
lol, it's not "bitcoin" that is going to be taxed.
it's the individuals owning bitcoin.
if you own bitcoin you would have to report it to the irs, and any gains would be taxed.
&gt; you would have to report it to the irs would have... we're moving to a globalized world if you keep trying to tax people on a territorial basis you're gonna have a bad time.
as long as you are physically in the us, they could imprison you for not reporting, and it's the same in most 1st world countries.
you could move to some lawless 3rd world shithole of course, but then you are likely to just get kidnapped and robbed of all your btc.
i can do business with whoever i want in the world, and unlike today where every transaction i make has to go through a bank and can be seen by the irs i can do them through a blockchain and the irs can't know shit.
i will pay taxes on what they know, but as time goes on there will be less and less transactions they know of, as everything is moved to the blockchain out of their reach.
i think you’re missing the point.
if you’re an american, you use usd.
the government declares you must pay taxes in usd.
so at some point you will have to convert some bitcoin back into usd.
you will have to record and account for the gains, most likely capital gains in usd.
your idea would only work if a major revolution came about and everyone starting using bitcoin as a currency, which will probably never happen.
more and more people will start using cryptocurrencies and less people will use dollars, every day that passes less transactions will be off the blockchain and if money doesn't leave the blockchain the government has very little chances to know what i have to pay taxes on.
dude, you are arguing with a **dictionary**.
my quote is literally the definition of the word *blockchain*.
a blockchain is not an algorithm, it is a sub-set of distributed ledger systems.
if you look at a dictionary to understand what a cs term means, you are already off target.
a blockchain is a system of cryptographically verified transaction records.
those transactions do not have to be transactions of cryptocurrency.
they can be transactions of anything.
and you are still wrong if you pin it directly to just cryptocurrency.
you may claim people are arguing with dictionaries, yet you are arguing against what has already been publish in peer reviewed journals and proceedings [ref - k. christidis and m. devetsikiotis, "blockchains and smart contracts for the internet of things," in ieee access, vol.
4, pp.
2292-2303, 2016.
](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7467408/) your quote is the definition of what blockchain is for what most people would understand it as.
however, believing that block chain and crypto currency must be linked because they were seemingly pitched in the same publication is daft.
an algorithm is very rarely trapped to just the one application it was made to work with.
if that was the case then a large portion of machine learning would not make any sense at all.
you have no idea what you are talking about.
a blockchain does work on the concept of transferring a token, yet is one that does not have to be directly linked to a form of currency over a method of recording transactions.
as noted above: one could be the movement of physical assets between people in the form of deeds or contracts.
whether it is a house or a car, the transaction can be recorded, physical money exchanged, yet no use for a cryptocurrency to handle it.
if you wish to dispute that blockchain transactions can be used to document or maintain physical item transactions then by all means publish a paper that challenges the numerous recent publications that directly look at the idea of using blockchain to handle real world transfers, but until then you are wrong to assume blockchain needs cryptocurrency.
you won't get far if you keep trying to understand complex computer science technologies based on 2 sentences long dictionary descriptions.
dictionary definitions change this is an argument about what currency is.
is a coupon currency?
is a bond currency?
you are correct that some form of token is needed, but if that token is currency can easily be debated.
&gt; blockchain is not bitcoin which is kind of pointless for australia to implement a blockchain without the decentralization of bitcoin.
blockchain is just a database with linked encrypted records between each other.
the brilliance of bitcoin is the decentralization of that blockchain, not the blockchain itself.
but if the stock exchange implemented the stocks within bitcoin, then nobody would need the exchange, so they would basically eliminating themselves and that would be a big no no.
did you read the article?
it literally says that it’s a distributed ledger.
you simplycan’t implement stocks with bitcoin since bitcoin is a single currency while stocks are far more complicated and comprised of multiple currencies along with many other elements.
can you really call bitcoin a currency at this point?
with how volatile it is, it’s more like a speculative asset than a currency at this point.
if the value can fluctuate 10-30% in a single day, it doesn’t make a lot of sense to trade with it.
steam just disabled bitcoin purchases for this exact reason.
it’s got coin in the name, but that means less and less each day now.
it's a currency for sure.
there are plenty of examples of currencies which have been volatile in the past, such as the zimbabwe dollar.
plenty of currencies are bought up solely as an asset, such as the dollar, euro, pound, and the yen.
it’s no less a currency than anything else.
just because something is volatile doesn’t disqualify it from being a currency.
plus it’s still less volatile than zimabwe’s currency was at a point.
&gt; stocks are far more complicated and comprised of multiple currencies along with many other elements.
you do realize bitcoin can do so much more than just numeric values, right?
what a stock market needs is not a cryptocurrency, they need a solution fit for a stock market, not cryptocontracts.
it can still use a distributed ledger, but it would have to be a different implementation.
[deleted] ok, correction, you can store arbitrary data in bitcoin through sending bitcoin to addresses which encodes your data, but that’s ultimately a terrible way to encode data.
there are better systems out there.
&gt; but that’s ultimately a terrible way to encode data.
no, it's not.
if you want to keep it trustless and decentralized, it's the only way to encode data and send it to its owner.
you misunderstood.
bitcoin’s blocks contain only transactions - so to store arbitrary data you would have to do it in the form of transactions.
oh could create a decentralised blockchain which would allow you to store any data you wanted, but bitcoin specifically is limited to only transactions.
you seem to be confusing public ledger blockchain with bitcoin.
im not really knowledgeable about what this means and all in technical terms but can a blockchain handle the amount of transactions that high frequency trading bots put through a system like that?
yes it can.
throughputs for trading are crazy - i won't be surprised if 'market trade transactions' are the highest ever per second, considering any type of transaction happening in the financial world... and i don't think any current blockchain framework can achieve that without fundamentally changing a lot of stuff in terms of how they are implemented(consensus, transaction processing etc) *edit:* as a classic case of redditor - i read just *part of the* title above...assuming the entire exchange is going to move to blockchain.
as /u/cdnhearth [pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7i5ikw/australian_stock_exchange_to_move_to_blockchain/dqwlkeq/).
**it is only to settle trades at the end of the day**.
so no more t+2?
i think you may be mistaken about what the blockchain is going to be doing.
the blockchain is for *settlement* of trades, at the end of the trading day.
so, at the end of the day, all the market participants (the brokerage firms and the central depository) all settle up.
x # of shares go to this broker, and y dollars comes back to the repository.
it's the conglomeration of the days trading that gets settled between all the banks/brokerages.
all the participants run the blockchain for clearance, but the individual trades are all totalled and settled up.
for example, if 5 clients of a brokerage all trade in the same security, and as a *net* result, 5000 shares are sold, and 4000 bought, the brokerage and the central repository only exchange 1000 shares and the value of those shares represent.
the brokerage settles up internally on it's own books the shares that don't need to be moved outside of the firm (but will move from one account to an account of a different client).
what this is *not* going to do is anything to do with the market trade matching engine.
that is the millisecond flash trading technology.
that will not be changing.
ripple can absolutely handle it.
it was designed for it.
and u expect the asx blockchain won't be distributed (much) and since these stock ledgers are financed through stock sales there is no need to crazily run up the hashing difficulty.
that is purely an anti inflation device in **coins**.
since this isn't about currency but about ledger they don't need to artificially slow down the process and issue coins etc.
all the need is the necessary crypto to ensure ledger validity.
coins then have the morning process tobfinace said validation, which then needs anti inflation mechanic to keep coin issuance in check aka artificially slow down the process.
stock ledger block chain would instead benefit from fast as possible processing and has no need for financing.
it isn't so decentralized it is run by exchange which then finances it out of transaction fees and additionally probably demands each participating trader to run verifying node.
which will finance this from their profits of stock actions.
all of the mining is literally artificial slow down for the specific use case of decentralized coinage.
for purely ledger use case purposes only relevant things are the public crypto signatures and the interlinking chained hashs.
first ensuring the authencity of transaction aka that if say a stock buy was issued to exchange it was really issued by the broker in whose name it is done (based on the assumption and security practices of only the broker has the matching privatekey to the publickey they have registered with stock exchange).
said publickey key registrations actually are only probably something to be recorded in the ledger.
signed by the exchange indicating they have verified and approved the broker in to the exchange the hashs are to ensure the continued validity of the recorded data in block and the correct order of blocks aka ledger data doesn't get corrupted and stays in order.
reading their website, looks like it was designed for money transfers - not for trading?
edit: https://ripple.com/xrp/market-performance/ ledger close time = 3.26 sec transactions per second = 14.5 average nyse trading per day: http://www.nyxdata.com/data-products/product-summaries they would run a local centralized version with fairly simple difficulty ratings to ensure 5-10 second settlements of all transactions.
the assets can still be bought and sold in fractions of seconds and double spending could be prevented via their normal 2nd layer tech.
blockchain is not necessarily the bitcoin method.
tangle is a light-weight "block-chain" method that doesn't consume inordinate amounts of power.
the performance would be awful unless there has been some sort of breakthrough.
that isn't true at all.
bitcoin can't handle that many transactions at that speed, but we're not talking about bitcoin here.
blockchain technology can 100% do this.
it depends, stock trades are very much a low latency use case.
any distributed ledger will be too slow, these guys freak out over single digit ms. what i speculate is happening is they are bypassing the chain for individual transactions.
note: i work in distributed data movement and storage, including for a major financial data company in the past right.
i've done plenty of work in the computational end of things and while a blockchain solution should be capable of scaling for something like this, i'd be concerned about the overhead and the potential for intentionally disrupting transaction times.
we'll see.
&gt; stock trades are very much a low latency use case.
[very true](http://www.radiolab.org/story/267195-million-dollar-microsecond/) bitcoin is slow due to it's efforts to try and ensure decentralisation of their blockchain.
ripple is a centralised blockchain and processes transactions within a few seconds.
seconds is ages in the finserv world.
seconds is not ages in the finserv world.
currently transactions can take days to be processed.
have you ever seen the blockchain of bitcoins?
actually, the bitcoin blockchain can only handle 7 transactions per second (compare to visa's 1000 tps, for example).
it's scalable though [it's not that simple.
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bitcoin_scalability_problem) imo if btc investors are lucky, btc will become a way to store wealth, like gold.
if they are unlucky, the bubble will burst once the issues with the algorithm become debilitating.
btc cant really be used as a true currency replacement.
maybe some other cryptocurrency will come to prominence, that can be.
well it worked perfectly fine for hackers and people on the darkweb.
because back then there were very few transactions.
it's only now becoming an issue.
&gt; the asx’s announcement to adopt the decentralized technology is a significant endorsement of blockchain tech, which will make transactions cheaper, efficient and significantly faster without the need for a middleman.
&gt; digital asset ceo blythe masters added: &gt; &gt; “after so much hype surrounding distributed ledger technology, today’s announcement delivers the first meaningful proof that the technology can live up to its potential.
together, da and our client asx have shown that the technology not only works, but can meet the requirements of mission critical financial infrastructure"'.
blockchain is really the only reason bitcoin has survived this long.
it's a bubble and it *will* burst.
especially with a bunch of big name vendors pulling support.
now with futures trading, banks are going to try and tank it.
that's where you are slightly wrong.
it's fueled by idiots, and there is a near infinite supply of idiots.
as long as people buy the bubble won't burst.
well... idiots and illegal activity.
beyond currency speculation the most common uses of bitcoin seem to be gambling, trafficking, and drugs.
the uses you mentioned are unrelated to the price, they are a short-term medium.
usd -&gt; btc -&gt; usd always in those cases.
the price is purely fueled by idiots.
speculation is a term i don't like.
it makes it seem like bitcoin has a chance of being useful, it doesn't.
speculation is purely "gosh i hope the price goes up so i can make a quick buck".
this is just gambling at this point.
because of compound interest though you need exponentially more people buying in all the time to maintain a constant growth rate which quickly becomes sustainable.
let's say bitcoins price grows at 500% a year.
you don't need too many years like that before there's literally not enough money in the world to increase the price any further.
of course it will hit unsustainable levels well before then because people aren't going to start selling their houses to buy bitcoins and there really isn't that much money for the average person to spend on speculation.
it's already hit mainstream awareness like gold speculation did a few years back, so the money flooding in now represents a large percentage of the money available from joe public speculator.
it can't go much more mainstream than it has, which means they're going to rapidly run out of new speculators to keep inflating the price.
as fewer people start buying in, growth rate slows, that makes it less appealing to speculators, so less people buy, which slows the growth rate even more, eventually the cycle of (people buy -&gt; price goes up -&gt; more people buy) inverts to (people sell -&gt; price goes down -&gt; more people sell) that's why it's smart to buy now and sell before people realize that bitcoin might not be that big of a thing really.
the hard part is figuring out when people will start realizing that.
and that's where you are wrong.
once the idiots realize the big banks who run the most powerful sovereign governments will not touch virtual currency for trillions of reasons (the us dollar), which is going to happen very soon, no one will want it anymore and this will be apparent even to the idiots.
people don't realize that the only reason any kind of money is worth anything at all is that people believe it is worth something.
what's the difference between the dollar and the bolivar?
people don't think the bolivar is worth much because of the shitty economy in venezuela.
gold is as rare as helium.
why is helium not as expensive as gold?
there are literally more diamonds in the galaxy than there are puppies.
why aren't puppies worth a few thousand per puppy?
so... you're technically illiterate and gullible.
that's not a good combination.
blockchain as you're describing it is **not** a new technology.
it is not unique to bitcoin nor is it the "only" reason bitcoin survives.
blockchain refers to a cryptographic hash (also known as a signature) generated from a transaction which combines with previous transactions, making the ledger difficult to corrupt, as reproducing those hashes with modified data is computationally infeasible.
this has existed in databases for *decades*.
a more formal "tree" structure was introduced in 1991/2 with "[merkel trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/merkle_tree)", building off a concept first patented in [1979](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/textdoc?db=epodoc&amp;idx=us4309569).
"blockchain" is just a cryptographically updated term for "ledger", which is apparently the only part of the concept that many seem familiar with, so they latch onto it in order to make the system fit into their existing worldview.
in fact, the blockchain is, if anything, the least innovative component of bitcoin.
the issue which bitcoin sought to address was not how to build a reliable ledger - that had been solved for decades - it was how to build a reliable *distributed and decentralized* ledger out of a list of transactions, many of which might be corrupt, fraudulent, or otherwise invalid.
mathematically, the problem is known as the byzantine generals problem.
*that's* the issue that bitcoin used blockchain *and* mining to address.
simply put, distributed blockchain does *not* work unless the incentive to act as an honest part of the network outweighs the rewards of manipulating or modifying the chain by amassing a surplus of computation power in the network.
that's why the expensive mining function is **required**.
if a chain is closed, modifiable, centralized, or otherwise non-distributed, then it's **not** a cryptocurrency blockchain, it's just an old-fashioned ledger in a standard flat database with a bunch of useless crypto added on to the end which adds no actual security and performs no verification.
edit: saying that blockchain is the only reason bitcoin survives is like looking at the first car, ignoring the steering, engine, etc., and saying it's only moving around because of the wheels.
no... it's not the wheels.
i'm not saying the wheels are unimportant, but they are literally the oldest and least interesting parts of the invention.
&gt; simply put, distributed blockchain does not work unless the incentive to act as an honest part of the network outweighs the rewards of manipulating or modifying the chain by amassing a surplus of computation power in the network.
and this incentive can exist without proof-of-work mining.
other distributed consensus algorithms can exist, such as proof-of-stake.
damn that's a lot of koolaid.
aren't block chains incredibly slow?
depends which one.
bitcoin is laughably bad at 10 minutes to an hour, but there are others that do it in ~10 seconds.
the best way to get really fast transactions is a private network, so not one of the "main" ones (bitcoin, ethereum, etc.).
in a private network only those with access transact so the speed is always consistent, this also allows the owners to put more sensitive info on the chain that would otherwise be hard to cover up on a public network.
unfortunately even that is too slow.
but the article does specify that it will be used for transactions verification and storage at the end of the day though.
i dono, i've been playing with hyperledger for work and for the most basic of networks its pretty damn snappy.
part of that is due to the fact there are no "miners" the transaction or post is just verified by the network participants so it's pretty much instant.
i mean, does it work in the range of microseconds per transaction?
i am pretty sure single digit ms is unacceptable for stock exchange.
just like an instant messenger.
one of the reasons public chains are slow is because of the security/mining aspect.
remove that and replace it with permissioned access and its just like any other database; only this one has immutability to existing transaction events.
sounds like stock exchanges around the world will be putting in for major upgrades for their network architecture then.
(i actually work in this industry so it's good news... for me!)
can someone eli5 what blockchain is?
this is better than eli5: https://anders.com/blockchain/ the unsexy way to think of it, its just a database.
what makes it different is that this database is decentralized.
there is no one master computer, that if it fails takes down the whole database system.
the clever (and sometimes slow) algorithms are for making sure all the computers agree on whats in the database.
its called the double spend problem.
cant have different computers thinking the same money is in different wallets.
it depends on how you use it and for what.
but very simply put, you take a bunch of things which change the state of something (like transactions) and put them in a block, each block includes a reference to the previous block using hashes (which means that it can't be changed).
for bitcoin, anyone can collect the transactions which have been broadcast and if they're lucky in their mining create a new block which refers to the last one known (most uses of blockchain not dealing with cryptocurrencies do not have mining).
this means the list of blocks can be created by different people, but it's also possible that the chain splits into two or more (because two get lucky at the same time and so refer to the same previous block).
in bitcoin this is handled by saying that whichever chain is longest is the correct one, and the other doesn't matter (which is why bitcoin transactions take a long time to be "confirmed", depending on how sure you want to be).
it's also possible to allow a blockchain which have split to be merged again, if there's no conflict, or it can be resolved.
"blockchain technology" is only a part of bitcoin and use of a blockchain may not be anything like bitcoin.
think of git version control for instance.
powered by all that clean australian coal power beyond blockchain, there is iota.
its in its infancy stage now but there has been promising research on how it works using nodes.
give it a read, the future is bright with them, i think.
i see a lot of "bitcoin bad, blockchain good" posts popping up these days, but i'd encourage people to consider the opposite point of view.
what do private blockchains offer?
what are institutions going to do with blockchains that bitcoin and other open source projects can't or won't?
why would a system designed to be trustless benefit from adding in gatekeepers, trusted third parties, and other figures of authority?
people are wary about bitcoin due to the price, but i'm personally far more worried about blockchain hype.
the internet bubble didn't pop for good businesses that provided a valuable and competitive service, it popped for companies whose value was based on the hype surrounding the technology.
bitcoin has already shown it's use case and value, vague promises of optimization using blockchains has not.
but the blockchain here is just for verification and tracking; not the actual product.
the product are stocks, which have company and its assets stuck on to it.
bitcoin is currently traded/invested as a commodity.
but unlike normal commodities, you can't do something with bitcoins itself that is useful (with grains, you can eat them.
with gold, you can have industrial applications).
people rave about bitcoins as a stable currency; it's not, that much value increase in a currency is bad.
the current bitcoin has too little transaction capacity and is unsuitable for small payments.
but if a central authority exists governing this market, as i'm sure is the case here, what benefits does a blockchain provide over something like an sql database?
blockchains are purpose built for trustless decentralization, and we already have technology that performs better in centralized systems with figures in positions of trust and authority.
&gt;but if a central authority exists governing this market nothing, but if you don't trust the central authority, you always pick the blockchain method.
having options doesn't have to be bad.
yes, but which blockchain are you going to pick?
the one run by a central authority?
blockchain only has value if it's distributed, and why would you choose any but the one with the most hashing power behind it?
most blockchain use cases sound like 'find the problem for this solution(blockchain)' just use git?
verification and tracking with trust works just fine without blockchains.
look at certificate transparency.
git uses merkel trees for verification, which is the same data structure that bitcoin uses for its blocks.
git and bitcoin are *highly* similar structurally.
one uses token transactions for modifying the chain, and the other uses software patches.
but they're both built off merkel trees.
certificate issuance is another area which could be easily represented using the same data structure - but issues like identity verification need to be addressed in cas, so there's still a human trust layer involved there which blockchain can't do on it's own.
bitcoin is highly valued because it is the investment vehicle used to fund other blockchain projects that are useful on themselves, when dapps start to catch on the cryptocurrencies they have inbuilt will become very valuable, and the only way to get to those other cryptocurrencies right now is through bitcoin.
&gt; what do private blockchains offer?
what are institutions going to do with blockchains that bitcoin and other open source projects can't or won't?
why would a system designed to be trustless benefit from adding in gatekeepers, trusted third parties, and other figures of authority?
speed, efficiency, and governance.
bitcoin is slow and consumes a lot of energy simply because it is decentralised and their implementation of proof-of-work simply doesn't scale efficently.
also, none of the issues get fixed because no one can agree on what to do.
an sql database is faster and more efficient than a blockchain will ever be, and if it is being used by a central authority, governance is already built in.
the issues absolutely get fixed, because anyone can take the code and do their own thing.
look at bch, or ethereum or countless other cryptos who split off to pursue their own vision.
there are three independent teams working on lightning network right now, which is just one potential scaling solution.
this is new tech and development doesn't happen instantly.
it also provides transparency in governance, which an sql database will have difficulty keeping a track of unless it’s designed as such.
block chains have transparency built in, making it an easier vehicle to track and trace changes to prevent fraud and correct mistakes.
an sql server isn't immutable, so i'm not sure why you are comparing it.
that is the entire point of blockchain.
the issues are caused by decentralisation and will get fixed eventually.
there are many altcoins attempting to, but a fix is a long way away.
ripple is an extremely fast blockchain because they decided to be centralised.
why would you want immutability in financial markets?
immutability is a liability.
say a court orders a financial market to reverse a trade due to some legal issue, saying "i can't" doesn't work so hot for businesses.
immutability is desirable in a trustless system, but actually reduces control in a centralized system.
&gt; say a court orders a financial market to reverse a trade due to some legal issue then you do another transaction back to that account.
you don't change history.
"consider if you will: bitcoin good, blockchain bad?"
excellent satire of the typical bitcoin investor.
12/10 someone has to take the risks there's no risks behind blockchain technology - the advantages are evident.
you are mistaking blockchain for bitcoin.
every chance of infrastructure has risks.
especially if it's a change to something that hasn't been tried it has been tried in a plethora of cryptocurrency alternatives.
you should have stopped at "every change of infrastructure has risks."
it hasn't been tried for stock market trading at this scale the scalability of blockchain technology is not really under doubt.
what advantages?
why does a centralized stock exchange want to be distributed and trustless?
https://caitlin-long.com/2016/08/03/no-you-dont-really-own-your-securities/ a blockchain literally can not exist without some sort of digital, transferable token, i.e.
cryptocurrency.
it does not have to be called "bitcoin", but it must be something which works exactly the same way or at least very similarly.
&gt; blockchain &gt; noun &gt; &gt; a system in which a record of transactions made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are maintained across several computers that are linked in a peer-to-peer network.
https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/blockchain if you find anyone telling you that "blockchain is good, but we don't need cryptocurrencies", you can be sure that they either have no idea what they are talking about or that they hope that you have no idea what they are talking about.
you’ve gotta stop pasting this all over.
this definition is incorrect.
somthing similear like au dollars you mean.
they can exist without cryptocurrency.
you've just said it, according to you, they just need a digital, transferable token.
cryptocurrencies all rely on those tokens, but not all digital, transferable tokens are cryptocurrencies.

yep, that dictionary definition is bullshit, so i can't blame you.
boy has oxford dictionary fallen low.
sounds like a dumb idea.
there's no reason for a decentralized ledger for thousands of securities this is good for bitcoin /s hitting $22,000 on the exchanges now.
~$16,000 usd did it just lose 6k in 40 minutes?
$aud vs $usd?
&gt; hitting $22,000 on the exchanges now.
[bitcoin now](http://pm1.narvii.com/6296/ff7a13e8b1e36ba1a086d7e009a7458144973030_hq.jpg) following the market all day, watching all the altcoins tank, and bitcoin is like "this isn't even my final form".
bitcoin = goku getes never got ssj3 tho nice.
people are finally realizing that blockchain's future is *not* as currency, but rather as a high security and fidelity exchange medium for verification.
is there any news yet on what back end token they will be using for transactions?
my fingers are crossed on iota.
but couldn't find any info digging around da holdings or their subs.
iota?
you think an actual stock exchange would be running a fresh off the block(chain) ico coin?
probably ibm's hyperledger or a private ethereum instance due to the fact they both have significant weight in the space.
edit: just did a search, asx used digital asset holdings, a company lead by blythe masters who is a huge fan of hyperledger, so very likely its a private hyperledger chain.
you're bang on.
it will be hyperledger &gt;while blockchain technology is considered to be uncrackable, the risks have been highlighted after bitcoin mining marketplace nicehash lost at least $60m this week when it was hacked.
yeah, that's not a problem at all, let's keep using this "uncrackable" technology such markets do not operate within the bitcoin protocol (except when coins enter or leave) and those markets do not use blockchains in their systems.
they work with regular databases on regular systems.
blockchain technology in itself **is** uncrackable (whatever it means anyway).
this is the main point behind a distributed ledger.... &gt; uncrackable never use that word.
ever.
the phrase "uncrackable" is always the word of a person who will be proven wrong.
a better term would be "able to provide security that could not feasibly be cracked within a reasonable amount of time or with a reasonable quantity of resources".
i mean, you of course ignore the biggest issue with blockchain that we see in bitcoin: it is only secure if it is truly distributed.
that is to say: once one group control over half of the resources to handle the blockchain infrastructure then they hold the power to either rewrite, destroy, or otherwise manipulate the infrastructure unimpeded.
again, i understand bitcoin is not the only form of block-chain yet is most prominent: all you need is for the top 4-5 bitcoin mining groups to have the majority of their systems affected by some form of malware and suddenly the attackers would be able to cause havoc with system.
there also exists the potential for malicious nodes to also cause problems to others.
to a point, the people who claim blockchain to be uncrackable would be the same ones who would believe that resources such as tor can render somebody anonymous, even when researchers had previously been unable to unmask ~10% of all users who had gone through their nodes.
notice a trend?
decentralized systems are vulnerable once you can can control enough of the total systems used.
edit: of course in the proposed system in the op, it will likely be centralized, but using the benefits of block chain to provide extra security, yet it will still have the same issue if infiltrated by a malicious party.
you're right about some things but mistaken about the total risk a 51% attack presents.
the issue is that while an attacker with 51% begins to rewrite old blocks, the rest of the network carries on, so not only does the attacker need to expend computing power to rewrite transactions, they also need to expend it to keep up with the rest of the network, and even then their ability to rewrite blocks is extremely limited in time frame.
they couldn't go back weeks or months, more like hours.
&gt; never use that word.
ever.
[well aykshually](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3a%2f%2fantennamag.com%2ffiles%2f2014%2f08%2fneckbeard-dictionary.jpg%3fw%3d600%26h%3d0%26zc%3d1%26s%3d0%26a%3dt%26q%3d89&amp;f=1) i get what you're going for, but the point still stands.

it's a modified version at best.
it's not decentralized as asx will govern it.

okay, that would definitely make it better, if they're trying to do this.

this is the best tl;dr i could make, [original](https://www.timesofisrael.com/argentina-judge-orders-arrest-of-ex-president-kirchner-over-iran-cover-up/) reduced by 69%.
(i'm a bot) ***** &gt; an argentine judge on thursday ordered the arrest of the country&amp;#039;s former president cristina fern&amp;aacute;ndez de kirchner for allegedly covering up iranian involvement in a 1994 bombing at a buenos aires jewish center that left 85 people dead.
judge claudio bonadio accused kirchner of the crime of treason as he asked lawmakers to remove the immunity from prosecution she has as a senator.
&gt; &amp;quot;as happens regularly in argentina, the news was first leaked to the press and cristina has not yet been notified,&amp;quot; an aide to the former president told afp.
in november an investigation by the country&amp;#039;s border police agency concluded that alberto nisman, who led the probe into the buenos aires terror attack, was murdered just four days after he formally accused then-president kirchner of covering up the role of former iranian officials in the attack.
&gt; kirchner&amp;#039;s leftist alliance in the senate has a total of 32 seats, but only around a dozen senators are in the kirchner camp.

"yo soy el senado."
- christina fernandez de kirchner let's let the government put that theory forth as opposed to the media before we start removing immunity.
if immunity can be taken dueto accusations in the media, why have it at all?
i agree but in this case she is fucking crooked and had the previous accuser assasinated.
but it sets a dangerous precedent.
there are many folks with diplomatic immunity that exploit it to the max, but we can't eliminate immunity for our diplomats in other countries even if everyone agrees we should.
good.
cristina was a pox for argentina.
there's a lot of pox left, though.
those proposed work reforms that i've heard about that supposedly macri was trying to push are just as evil.
you obviously don't know what you are talking about.
the situation is literally unsustainable without reforms.
nisman got wacked the day before he was supposed to present evidence of iran being behind the assassination.
now why would kirchner cover that up?
what deal did they have with iran?
hopefully we'll find out before the poor judge ends up dead supposedly, the deal was that iran would let the suspects be judged on its soil and be found innocent.
in exchange, iran would accept certain exports from argentina.
iirc, exportation was complicated at the time, as we had sanctions from europe.
so, extrapolating from that, you could say that cristina wanted to close the amia case, use that as propaganda, and secure some very needed exports with one sweep.
as usual, she was delusional.
people on reddit who claim that the iranians are better than the saudis should take a look at iran’s foreign policy.
they have exported terror like the 1994 bombing for decades.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/iran_and_state-sponsored_terrorism but shes so pretty /s thx forgot that... people actually used to say this to convince me to support sarah palin remember when obama winner of a nobel peace prize bombed a hospital with drones and killed another winner of the nobel peace prize?
was that terrorism?
no.
it was a war crime but let's pretend like it never happened.
why is it only terrorism when people do bad shit from countries you are condition to dislike, yet no one questions the acts of terrorism by the countries we are condition to like?
usa, the u.k. and israel do more terror to the rest of the world than iran and north korea.
but the corporate press ignore this in favour of their pro war propaganda.
i think the intent is critical for the definition of a war crime.
was the attack on the hospital intentional?
unintentional.
yes and no.
it depends who you ask.
it also depends on how much the media has conditioned you to see they world from their distorted way.
was the attack by bush and blair on iraq illegal, when their actions caused the death of half a million innocent people?
kill one person and that's murder, but kill half a million and that's just business, right?
so again, it depends who you ask.
ask the people that profit and they tell us it was fine.
it was an accident that obama bombed a hospital.
it wasn't supposed to go down like that.
they kill innocent people, with drones every day, on purpose by accident, but it simply doesn't get reported in our press.
tony blair went to war claiming sadam had wmd's but that was a lie.
the west certainly has wmd's but we just accept it's ok for us to use them and take down any foreign government that doesn't yet have a central bank owned by the rothschilds.
that's a happy coincidence isn't it.
just about every county the uk has gone to war with in my lifetime, didn't have any rothschilds banks, then after the war, they did.
if you look at it objectively, it kind of looks like america, britain and israel are the bad guys here.
and yet iran hasn't attacked another country for what, like about a hundred years.
but they have oil, and lots of lovely banks to take over, so it probably won't be long before we take them out, for some bullshit reason.
sadly the people who work for the british government who try to stop illegal wars like david kelly by reporting to the media that blair was actually lying, get murdered by the secret service.
and then ass clowns like tony blair get promoted to ambassador of peace for the middle east and trumpo gets to play king of the west.
donald wouldn't have achieved his powerful position without first agreeing to support the illegal occupation of palestine by israel because of the influence israel has over western political systems.
our president covered up a terrorist attack by starting another round of unending wars in the mid east and no one even flinched :( putin must be fucking happy.
his whole revenge campaign vs hillary has focused on making sure the world sees women as incompetent leaders.
he set up theresa may for failure with brexit and used his cyber warfare to leak the shit about dilma and the south korean cult-wacko.
by 2020 when trump wins again there will be farms of eastern european women in china.
that must be the most ridiculous thing i heard today.
congratulations and happy trolling!

"..announced at a glamorous ceremony hosted by actor morgan freeman.." that is just, perfect.
it's like having god narrate the birth of his child.
^^if ^^you ^^believe ^^that ^^sort ^^of ^^thing nah, you don't have to believe; it's still imaginatively meaningful.
* [***true facts about morgan freeman***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ch5mejk5zcq) why did they get an expert in russia's affairs as a host?
did i miss something?
yes so this means the big bang theory is confirmed?
if so that is sweet!
bing bang theory has reached "theory" level which is the highest level something can get in science and means that it is the accepted norm that scientists accept.
things we have proven for sure: * universe is expending exponentially and has been doing so for 13 billion years.
* at one point in the past there was an explosion big enough to have thrown background radiation into the entire universe * extrapolating backwards from how stars are formed now we can deduce that all atoms were once squeezed into 1 dense point at some point in the past these 3 points point **very** hard at the big bang theory being right and that's why it's reached the scientific status of "theory".
it's firmly established that the big bang happened and created the laws of physics and matter we have access to right now.
(energy is still disputed) this actual, concise definition of scientific theory needs to be pointed to every time someone is faced with some idiot arguing against scientific consensus (big bang, evolution, etc) by crying that “it’s just a ‘theory.’” it’s close but not total proof.
it would be like saying babies come from wombs just because a woman was seen giving birth.
while that is quantifiable and observable it lacks where a man impregnated the woman.
ah *that's* why they call it the big bang.
that is a truly awful analogy this shit just blows my god damn mind.
the incomprehensible enormity of the universe, the monstrous cosmic “things” like a quasar or black hole that exist.
we are so used to being confined to our little atmospheric bubble on our beautiful planet, it’s truly hard to wrap my head around the universe.
what it is, what it all means what does it all mean, basil?!
kaugh, this coffee smells like shit!
oh good then its not just me.. nitpicking but i just hate it when people say stuff like "what does it all mean?"
nothing man, its just the universe being the universe, stop trying to look for meaning everywhere :) better yet, supply your own meaning and paint the world :) just paint some happy little universes.
belles lettres unless there is meaning and we just don't have the tools to grasp it.
every time i think hard about general relativity my head warps.
you are just a bunch of atoms that through random effects became so complex in interaction with each other that they became conscious of the universe.
there is no meaning because for something to have meaning there needs to be intent behind it.
the universe is a random mix of energy and matter that follow specific rules.
that's all it is.
nothing mysterious about it.

take trump with him, please.
do we have to let them back in?
they really don't like gays over there huh?
pence is gay?
til he doesn’t meet privately with women unless his wife is there so you can’t call him a predator, and plus he literally gassed the entire gay population of the united states within his first month of office.
he is clearly 💯% gay not that there’s anything wrong with that!
there is certain to be some sarcasm in there.
no one can be so stupid to say that pence *literally* "gassed the gays".
i gotta say, not being alone with women is a good way to avoid a false accusation of sexual assault.
i wonder if us donations to fatah's budget are also unwelcome.
to be fair, he's not overly welcome in the u.s. either.
id be surprised if he was welcome at his own dinner table not if there are any women there other than his wife, whom he calls 'mother'.
is that bigot welcome anywhere?
when have american vps ever been welcome in palestine?
hardly a revolutionary statement.
pence and his apocalypse fetishist friends would let the entire world burn, literally, if they thought it would make some silly prophecy come true.

i think i got some on me not a troll.
palestine has never been a sovereign state.
before it was israeli, it was jordanian, before that british, before that ottoman, and so on... it has been a part of various empires, usually bundled with modern day syria, lebanon, jordan as a single administrative "province".
for [example this was ottoman syria](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/ottoman_syria.png).
palestinians as a nationality are relatively new, just as lebanese, jordanians are also new nationalities created by france and the british.
i was referring to the excessive way in which he stated it.
he didn't say it once he had to reword it and force it several times.
ahh i gotcha.
kind of asinine imo.
everyone except the most right-wing jew realizes peace has to be made and palestine has to exist as an end game.
the difference between right and left is right is willing to give up less.

there's no way this deal will come back take a giant chunk out of anyone's ass in the future, noooope.
i understand allowing the families to leave, but allowing the fighters to leave, and leave with their weapons and gear, is a fucking stupid idea.
and?
hundreds of thousands of german soldiers where allowed to continue with regular lives after ww2.
this is how peace works, you cant genocide them or lock them all up... you seem to lack reading comprehension.
this is nothing like ww2, these terrorists did not go on to live peaceful lives, they went on to fight saa about al-bukamal, or to back to their countries to plan attacks there.
in this context, you absolutely can kill them all or at the least lock them up, thats the only way to deal with these people.
&gt;in this context, you absolutely can kill them all or at the least lock them up, thats the only way to deal with these people.
in the context of fighting inside a city that is also the home of hundreds of thousands of civilians, it is in the best interest off everyone to end the fighting earlier rather than later.
street-fighting is never a good idea.
&gt;these terrorists did not go on to live peaceful lives, they went on to fight saa about al-bukamal, or to back to their countries to plan attacks there some of them might have done so, but with the collapse of isis's territorial holdings (hell, raqqa was their capital), most of these terrorists would be very demoralized, and by giving them the opportunity to flee, you also open the opportunity for many of them to desert their cause and stop fighting all together.
that option is absent while fighting inside raqqa, surrounded on all sides with their backs to the wall.
how many other people are going to have to kill to wipe out those 1000?
what happens when they disintegrate back into the population?
are you going to go door to door to hunt them down?
are you going to bomb all of them?
is the us going to lead this clearing raqqa?
are we going to let another force come in that we have no control over?
i’m not saying i agree with letting them go, but i don’t understand the bigger picture as well as the us military.
we could be using them for a proxy war, but to me i don’t understand the situation enough to make comment on what is right or wrong.
of those 1000 fighters, how many do you think were conscripted, and how many do you think are going to continue their violence wherever they go?
we can’t win if we don’t look at the bigger picture.
we can’t win the war of attrition, we can only try to be one step ahead of them.
im 100% positive thats how people felt about germans post ww2 as well you would be 100% wrong.
how can you compare a defeated conventional military to foreign jihadist whos purpose in life is to kill the infidel and get martyred?
did isis surrender and capitulate?
you think after wwii when the world found out what the nazis did, they weren’t mad about it?
siege deals have been made for thousands of years to get the defenders out without the city being reduced to rubble.
obviously isis did surrender the city, aka the deal in the article..... what are you talking about.... the war vs isis in syria and iraq **is** conventional warfare.
their terrorist attacks in other areas of the world arent conventional but there is a font line, enemy controlled zones etc.. in syria/ iraq.
first of all, raqqa was already reduced to rubble with the airstrikes, you can see the pictures yourself.
secondly, ww2 ended with german surrender, there was no insurgency after and the fighting ended.
here there is no surrender, no end to fighting, and isis will remain as an insurgency after all the population centers are taken from them.
in this context, your comparison doesnt make sense, which is what i commented on.
first of all i said they used to do it to save the city, it happens now to save the population.
secondly this siege ended with a surrender deal with is.
modern city fighting is bloodier than any other, its easier to get them out and fight in the field later than lose twice the men and minimum double that in civilins.
they were reduced to small holdouts though.
probably has more to do with slowing down saa advances around dier ezor ieds and suicide bombers are unconventional warfare &gt; how can you compare a defeated conventional military to foreign jihadis yet you're conveniently leaving out that men and boys were forcefully conscripted to fight for isis under threat of death to themselves or their families.
yes, lets go ahead and kill them all.
lets continue the cycle that propagates terrorism by killing more innocents.
infidel killing and martyred for lots and lots of money.
those soldiers get bank, and are well funded, if you think that isis is some comical super villain islamic terrorist you might need to research on your own.
this conflict has about as much as islam does to theoretical physics.
of course money will be involved in something like this, but theres no denying that these are ideologically driven people.
this conflict has much to do about islam, to deny that would be absurd.
i dont see where i said they were comical super villains...its obvious they have extremist views.

people who were wholly aware of what they were signing up for and the ideology they were prepared to adopt.
the ss changed a countries doctrine so much it was a new state.

we'll see what happens next.
"that was, like, a whole month!
how can something that happened that long ago have any bearing on today?"
i’m not so sure.
i remember reading about this before.
it may not have been this particular city, but it had to do with letting the insurgents leave so that there would be less bloodshed in urban warfare.
this may be a different example, or simply a new interview that corroborates old news.
it happened multiple times already.
the most visible headline was probably a few months ago about the us bombing those who moved away a bit too far from a convoy because they made a deal with them to let the convoy move out of a city but anyone getting too far off from it was fair game.
that was about letting the rebels leave aleppo.
at the surprise of no one... those icbms that north korea is using which can reach the us are far more advanced than what they were using a few years ago.
investigations found that the missile technology is coming from a military hardware factory in eastern ukraine, ~~which is under the control of russia~~.
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/14/world/asia/north-korea-missiles-ukraine-factory.html &gt; those engines were linked to only a few former soviet sites.
government investigators and experts have focused their inquiries on a missile factory in dnipro, ukraine, on the edge of the territory where russia is fighting a low-level war to break off part of ukraine.
during the cold war, the factory made the deadliest missiles in the soviet arsenal, including the giant ss-18.
it remained one of russia’s primary producers of missiles even after ukraine gained independence.
&gt; but since ukraine’s pro-russian president, viktor yanukovych, was removed from power in 2014, the state-owned factory, known as yuzhmash, has fallen on hard times.
the russians canceled upgrades of their nuclear fleet.
the factory is underused, awash in unpaid bills and low morale.
experts believe it is the most likely source of the engines that in july powered the two icbm tests, which were the first to suggest that north korea has the range, if not necessarily the accuracy or warhead technology, to threaten american cities.
anything that would undermine and weaken the us is on russia agenda.
why do you think russia is pro trump lol edit: although at the same time i think there is a problem with “over sharing” since the average person has multiple platforms of social media.
(causing that game of telephone to get a little lengthier, and problems will always seem more abundant than they actually are) i think they were pro trump during the election cycle, now they'd love to watch him fall flat on every issue.
they want 8 years of this ham i disagree with you here.
i firmly believe that they used trump's russia ties to make us lose faith in our democracy.
they can use him until he gets caught and then when he does, it undermines the legitimacy of the us government.
it's incredibly brilliant; putin is evil, but a freaking political genius imho.
alexander dugin is the genius.
want a forecast?
read foundations of geopolitics.
yeah, idk why people are surprised when russia does some the "outrageous" things it does.
it's been spelled out for us and we have access to their playbook.
an american campaign team/consultants got yeltsin reelected, which threw russia into chaos.
putin never forgot.
i always laugh when people say the cold war ended.
edit: there's even a movie about it: http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0324619/ really funny, right?
eli5?
&gt; foundations of geopolitics [link for the lazy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics) &gt; russia should use its special services within the borders of the united states to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke "afro-american racists".
russia should "introduce geopolitical disorder into internal american activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the u.s. it would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in american politics well, fuck.
thanks for the link.
i'm canadian, but damn that's pretty intense when you start looking into it.
pretty much confirms some things i already suspected.
til i guess.
&gt;the book declares that "the battle for the world rule of [ethnic] russians" has not ended and russia remains "the staging area of a new anti-bourgeois, anti-american revolution."
kind of ironic considering putin and his billionaire buddies running russia and it's satellites make the american bourgeois look like girl guides.
holy fucking shit.
doesn't rule out putin being a genius for using dugin's expert knowledge and executing well.
i can't tell if he is executing well or not, though.
he's certainly hurting us, and he got what he wanted out of ukraine and brexit, but he's got caught each time and is hurting just as much from the sanctions specifically targeting him and his oligarchs.
of course, it would be near impossible not to get caught with operations so big.
he wasn't successful in getting sanctions lifted, but that seems like it was more of a side goal with undermining the us being the more important (and realized) goal.
maybe he thinks he can just wait the sanctions out with the revolving door that is us leadership.
it's hard to say how successful putin has been.
his active measures have been incredibly successful and not just in the us, it's hard to argue against that.
but the issue is he gets caught and russia hurts too as a result.
he's certainly been your typical machiavellian russian leader, but i've heard it said his tactics are better than his strategy.
perhaps that comes from him being involved in the nitty gritty in the kgb.
it's hard to say he's been successful before we see how the rest plays out.
but we can take comfort in that in getting caught messing in our elections, his plan was only half successful.
he was supposed to undermine us and also get out from under our thumb at the same time, but the sanctions never got lifted.
putin's election interference looks a little desperate in that light, like a cornered snake lashing out.
he might hurt us but he's not helping himself.
he did well in syria.
fsa and our proxies are falling.
do you know of a reliable english translation?
i haven't been able to find one richard spencer's ex-wife was a student of dugin's and has been [working on translating](http://www.newsweek.com/leaders-charlottesvilles-alt-right-protest-all-have-ties-russian-fascist-651384) it.
tldr - he's an open fascist and supports the hastening of the end of the world through complete world war.
putin is good at seizing opportunities, but lacks the forethought to conceive well thought out, long term plans.
if he was that great, he would have pulled russia out of its shithole by now.
all he is capable of is running the world's largest organized crime syndicate.
what makes you think putin has any interest in pulling russia out of the shithole that has made him absurdly wealthy?
to maintain power.
right now his friends are losing money, and i bet they are not really happy.
your assuming he wants a prosperous nation.
the definition of corruption is enriching yourself at the cost of your countrymen.
this is true but russia would also very much love to be a legitimate super power with no sanctions on them and a large economy.
as it stands, they're economy is tiny and they can't go to war with anyone, all they can do is hope he rest of the world falls apart to their levels.
i think he's good at holding on to power, geopolitical strategy and destroying other countries, but less good at building his own nation's economy.
people that run fucked up countries like russia or mexico have no interest at all in pulling said countries out of their shitholes, they get richer and more powerful thanks to those countries being such shitholes, in mexico the pri, ruling political party, has fucked the country beyond imagination, yet the president and his cabinet have become immensely wealthy, right now they are this close to legalizing using the army as their personal hitmen, so... why do you think putin or peña nieto (mexico's president) have any interest in using their smarts or skills to fix their countries, when sinking them deeper benefits them?
and the usa should watch out because trump seems to have studied quite well the way the pri and putin operate, everything he’s done so far aligns perfectly with what the ruling parties in russia and mexico and those of several latin american countries have done, you polarize the people, pull stupid stunts to create smoke screens, shut down science and education to keep people dumb and create false enemies to keep people fighting among themselves.
&gt;everything he’s done so far aligns perfectly with what the ruling parties in russia and mexico and those of several latin american countries have done, you polarize the people, pull stupid stunts to create smoke screens, shut down science and education to keep people dumb and create false enemies to keep people fighting among themselves.
fucking hell this guy mexicos.
putin is both one of the world's smartest leaders and one of the least moral humans i've seen.
combine that with thousands of professional hackers and you've got a damn dangerous man.
and a modern war that very few people acknowledge because to the average person, war involves guns, tanks and bombs instead of disinformation and fraud.
yep - the west has been at war for a couple years now, but because it doesn't involve big weapons, we've been rolling over and letting it happen or even encouraging it to happen.
"if russia is listening..." as my buddy in the army says.
they respect the guy's leadership abilities, they don't like the guy, they may not agree with him, but that doesn't matter when it comes to it.
they respect him.
it's dangerous to underestimate your enemy, that's a smart attitude.
even if trump gets impeached, his entire cabinet is compromised too.
plus all the judges he's appointed, and all the appointments he's left vacant... it's gonna take years to undo this mess, especially if the horrendous tax bill for the wealthy goes through.
[deleted] [except us intelligence officials have disputed the findings reported in that ny times article:](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-intelligence/north-korea-likely-can-make-missile-engines-without-imports-u-s-iduskcn1av2ck) &gt; &gt; north korea likely has the ability to produce its own missile engines and intelligence suggests it does not need to rely on imports, u.s. intelligence officials said on tuesday.
&gt; &gt; the assessment disputes a new study by the london-based international institute for strategic studies that said that the engines for a nuclear missile north korea is developing to hit the united states likely were made in factories in ukraine or russia and probably obtained via black market networks.
&gt; &gt; the new york times cited the study on monday.
the newspaper’s report said that classified assessments by u.s. intelligence agencies mirrored the iiss finding.
&gt; &gt; “we have intelligence to suggest that north korea is not reliant on imports of engines,” one u.s. intelligence official told reuters.
“instead, we judge they have the ability to produce the engines themselves.” &gt; &gt; the u.s. officials did not disclose any details of what underpinned the assessment on the high-performance liquid-fueled engines, called rd-250‘s.
&gt; thats even scarier.
if north korea can build icbms by themselves.
it's more likely they've built their program on espionage and bribery.
doesn't much matter since we're here now.
why is it so hard to believe that the north koreans can do rocket science?
they have had ten years to do it on their own, it's like sixty year old technology.
it’s not just engineering the systems it’s getting the correct materials that are reliable enough to do the job and having manufacturing capabilities that are precise enough to build parts for rockets.
this is a nation-state you're talking about, whose only economy is based on a military-industrial complex.
they have at least the structure, the organization, the manufacturing capabilities to do this.
what's missing is the r&amp;d, and they're pouring the entire resources of a nation-state just to do that.
it doesn't take a big economy to develop nukes.
it just takes determination, some source of fissile material, and time.
just look at how pakistan, a third world, incredibly poor economy by anyone's standards, got their own nukes in 1998, after twenty years of development.
also, remember the development part gets shorter each time.
this is seventy-year old technology.
in a few decades, it'll be a century-old technology.
do people really think that an organization with enough determination wouldn't be able to piece together century-old technology?
especially since nukes aren't really that hard to build at the scale they want.
a basic gun-type uranium bomb like little boy is so fucking easy to build.
you could literally just drop two subcritical pieces of heu on each other and they would go supercritical and explode.
modern cnc milling systems have good enough tolerances to build a pit of plutonium in a perfect enough sphere to be useful in an implosion (fat man) style weapon, and high speed detonation systems like krytons are old technology that are probably pretty easy to reproduce.
once you have those, it's not too hard to boost it with tritium or deuterium to get some fusion boosting, or to just go full lithium deuteride h-bomb.
with open source radiation transport simulation systems like geant4, you could probably simulate the necessary neutron pathway to achieve symmetric neutron flux on the lid.
you wouldn't even need to physically test anything.
dude, your probably gonna have cia knocking on your door in the next few days with all that information lmao.
i'm surprised.. that in 2017 world leaders are essentially like 5 year olds with nuclear weapons.
it's 2017 and our elected officials haven't figured out a way to peacefully diffuse this situation.
with our incredible knowledge of science, history, and everything, we seem to be devolving into chaos, tribalism, and sheer stupidity.
i'm surprised that we can put a man on the moon, explore the bottom of the ocean, but we can't act peacefully towards each other.
we are unable to learn from mistakes that were made within our lifetimes, and are doomed to repeat them, despite being able to create machines capable of learning.
i am surprised that despite our impressive intellect, we as a species are staggering into the 21st century with hatred and a thirst for blood in our hearts.
we struggle to understand and communicate with each other, despite having the most sophisticated communication devices ever created.
i'm surprised that greed outweighs a love for humanity, and that we know that our planet is changing because of us, and that this will destroy the habitats that allow us to survive.
i am surprised that we are killing ourselves despite having the technological ability and moral understanding to overcome these problems, and that there are people who don't care simply because their yearly bonus depends on it.
we have all this knowledge, and are immensely capable as a species, yet we ignore our history at the expense of our descendants.
i am surprised that people can so thoroughly hate their neighbor while they go to church and pretend to love thy neighbor.
as a species we are really failing to live up to our own potential.
we could be so much better than this.
instead, we seem to be cheerfully heading toward our own extinction; https://i.imgur.com/21hhqzk.jpg https://i.imgur.com/0yltsyk.png https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arhqs8sffdo see....you're working under the assumption that everyone *wants* peace.
34th rule of acquisition, "war is good for business."
so, rule 34?
it works.
everyone gets fucked.
i know the only thing that works for me anymore is fantasizing about total nuclear annihilation.
is that an icbm in your pants or are you just happy to see me?
yes 35th rule of acquisition, "peace is good for business."
17th rule of acquisition: a contract is a contract is a contract...but only between ferengi.
congress/lobbyists = ferengi not nuclear war deep-space 9 quotes?
oh baby you're getting my lobes a-tingle.
i was just arguing about the book starship troopers on here a couple days ago, and there's a very relevant quote from heinlein: "war is not violence and killing, pure and simple; war is controlled violence, for a purpose.
the purpose of war is to support your government’s decisions by force.
the purpose is never to kill the enemy just to be killing him .
.
.
but to make him do what you want him to do.
not killing .
.
.
but controlled and purposeful violence."
there have been some conflicts where the goal was to kill off the enemy in order to take over their land.
or for whatever ideological or religious reason, and then repopulate their land with your people.
that's what hitler had in mind for eastern europe and russia.
that still is just imposing the will of your government by force.
if the people on the disputed land just packed up and left, there would be no war.
same for "holy wars" if everyone in either side converted, no war.
the will is not to kill the people, but to create a bigger state (by conquering) or unify creeds (by religious purge) or that all actors are rational.
stalin thought he understood hitler, he didn’t, so the nazi invasion of ussr was a surprise to him despite their superior intel telling him for months hitler was planning to invade.
ditto for the western allies negotiating with him.
that's not true at all, stalin tried to sign defense treaties with west europe to deter hitler, but they refused and gave hitler a green light to go east at munich.
i agree that stalin was open to treaties with the west but that does not negate my comments.
you have to understand putin.
he's ex-kgb and has managed to amass a lot of power for himself.
i imagine he feels like the us stole russia's rightful place as the dominant superpower.
he's a snake and will sabotage us interest any chance he gets.
he is not to be trusted.
politics is a dirty game they're all trying to win by any means necessary.
it's also because nearly two thirds of russian govt income comes from oil exports.
with the price falling through the floor, they can't afford not to export it wherever they can, and nk is a captive market.
plus russia and nk share a border.
it's hilarious that we expect them not to use it for trade.
we sanction russia, so why would they care about obeying nk sanctions?
they talk a big game at the un about censuring nk, but they are one of the key reasons why the regime still manages to pull it's shit.
i mean russia specifically agreed to nk sanctions at the un security council, but they go under the table and sell them oil anyway.
it's a total crock of shit.
have you read the article?
&gt; given the limited scope of the resolution, however, russia is legally permitted to sell some oil to north korea.
russia never told they will not sell oil.
and by "pressuring pyongyong" nobody meant that it was the support of us sanctions.
yep, you're definitely correct there.
similar to how the shit going on in syria relates to natural gas pipelines.
russia doing stuff like this is pretty normal actually, not some kind of new 2017 phenomenon.
russia can only stand to benefit if the u.s. enters into a war with north korea.
war drums cause a spike in oil and gas prices, good for russia.
we have never lived in a more peaceful time.
just because you aware of all of the killing, doesn't mean there's more of it.
this is going to make a nice copy pasta, friendo.
&gt; it's 2017 and our elected officials well, i mean, you know, it's like putin has been kind of electing himself for the past couple decades or so.
that "our" bit doesn't really apply.
why does this always have to be the top comment every single time there is any sort of topic like this?
“i’m not surprised” and always saying it in a sort of way that implies “oh what everybody knows this, why is anyone surprised” but if that’s going to be the top response to these sorts of issues 99.9% of the time then what’s the point of having any discussion at all?
why do we have to state every single time some type of international controversy comes up that we aren’t surprised by damaging or dangerous actions and behavior?
what kind of fucking response is that?
an entity that we *do not trust* is actively supporting a leadership group we *know to be bad* and all we can say is that we are not surprised?
what the fuck is wrong with all of us?
it’s because something exactly like this fits into our narrative of “things going accordingly to plan” like the joker talked about in the dark knight.
this exact situation fits our narrative of ‘that’s just the way things are’ but we as a society continue to ignore these problems and refuse to demand any sort of resolution from our elected leaders.
the idea that ‘we can’t do anything’ in regards to nk and the fact that ‘we aren’t surprised’ russia is helping them just goes to show how limited anyone’s power is, and saying these things *only makes us weaker* ya this is what set me off dude.
'it's just human nature'.. 'not surprised at all'... 'don't worry, this is normal' https://i.imgur.com/21hhqzk.jpg the people that want to do something don't know what to do it's like russia is playing a game and it's trying to get all the achievements of the dark path.
edit: holy shit, is this thread infested by russian commenters spewing logical fallacies.
yeah america has done some bad things but a)you're wrong if you think everyone is equally bad and b)america doing bad things doesn't mean everyone else is free to do bad things and shouldn't be criticised for it.
funny how the same people saying "but what about 'murica?"
in every thread about russia never say "but what about russia" in a us thread where you can only read criticism about the us.
i understand them.
who'd go for the light path if you only get some chick with pistols - and get a fucking wookiee if you pick the dark side?
now that's a nice kotor 2 reference.
pure pazaak!
psa: kotor is available at the play store.

quick note, the swoop bike and space turrets shooting are the most difficult parts of the mobile experience, but are very doable.
welp i guess i'll be pooping more now.
yea swoop races especially, it gets expensive too.
it's like a kill free playthrough of a mgs game then you accidentally shoot one guy and decide to trigger happy the rest of the game i decided to stream mgs3 again on my ps2 emulator... weeeellll apparently it cant sense button pressure.
so the first guy i saw in game i slit his throat on accident.
(in the virtuous mission).
i forgot and did the rest of the game non lethal, including bosses.
i was annoyed when i got to the sorrow and saw the one guy walking around.
atleast im almost done with the playtrough.

nah, force wave is better; it applies a stun.
just get your charisma and wisdom high enough and no resistance matters.
ohhh man kotor is so awesome and its in my library right now america ran russia into the ground &amp; still has heavy trading sanctions on them... of course the ruskies are going to aid nk... im surprised they havent armed nk to the teeth.
where do you think nk huge leaps in nukes and rockets is coming from?
a really large chunk of nk regular weapons came from russia.
a really large chunk of weapons of many armed groups came from russia when the ussr collapsed and need to sell shit off.
in politics pretty much all paths are dark.
*i just asked putin and he said he didn't.
* trump, soon “by the way, he totally denies it” "and, believe me, he *really*...*totally* denies it.
believe me."
“sssnnniiiifffffff” bigly yuge "he's a good man... the best man... no really!
he'll be the best man once we get those stupid incest laws out of the way" nobody could have denied it more bigly.
and it was so, so denied, people.
we're gonna have a lot of fun, a lot of fun.
anteefa.
i invented antifa, good genes, nobody knows this, but crooked hillary, i call her crooked hillary, is the founder of antifa, folks.
"i asked him twice!

and believe him.
because i believe him and you believe me.
you elected me to believe.
this is too accurate /r/russiadenies/ we're in good touch.
i mean, really, the best of touches.
the greatest touch, really.
no other leaders touch each other like we do.
it's amazing.
now there's a porn that would turn gay men straight.
let's try it on pence first &gt;“so... it’s just straight up electricity?” &gt;&gt;mike pence ...and i believe that he believes hes telling the truth.
"putin did what?
omg i love north korea now!"
- trump and his magats what!
does this mean putin and trump aren't really great friends and instead of admiring trump's brilliance the russians have just been working to fuck with us all along?
who says they aren't friends?
just recently, the u.s. was trying to encourage china to cut off their oil supplies to north korea, giving russia exclusive control over exports.
technically they are friends, so far as the people in charge of the highest levels of government in both countries are firmly committed to dismantling and destabilizing the us government.
but fox and friends told donald he's doing a super bigly great job, so everything will be okay.
they both very clearly want a war between north korea and the us.
where's the disagreement?
tbf, they're also on the same page about gutting the us department of state, and sidelining the cia and fbi (the latter handles counter-espionage, both have loads of career professionals who are members of the swamp/deep state by virtue of knowing something about their job), think the us contributes too much to nato and should go their own way, etc.
etc.
that's a good point.
friends do help each other out.
was this a way to get china out of the picture?
sorry if it’s a dumb question, but i can see how the us would rather have a “friend” making money off the exports while also trying to break the connection between china &amp; nk.
china "out of the picture" is not good for us lol they both think they can outfox the other.
one of them is right; and it's probably not the reality tv host/real estate con-man.
you’re right about them fucking us all along.
but they wanted trump in office to do things a good president wouldn’t.
mainly because he’s as “brilliant” as a bag of leaves.
hey, now... my bag of leaves didn’t accidentally tweet an admission of guilt to a federal crime last week.
let’s be more careful with what you insult!
which tweet?
im trying to stay off twitter rn to focus on school.
he tweets too much to follow.
can you link it?
i have donny's iq test right here.
i'm afraid donny scored a negative five.
"what's wrong with negative five?"
we gave the same test to a shovel and two candy bracelets.
they each scored a positive seventeen.
of course they are friends.
ask trump.
putin told him so.
beginning to get a bit suspicious that russia got themselves banned from the winter olympics in south korea...🤔 but why would north korea (or for some reason russia) attack the winter olympics in south korea?
that would instantly unify just about every other country in the world to strike against the aggressor.
i obviously don't want anything like that to happen, but if someone made a movie or something following that plot line i'd watch the shit out of it golden face and kim jong un are going to blow up the olympics.

russia has had two whistleblowers with solid documentation illuminate their state sponsored doping program.
that is why they were banned.
the issue became impossible to ignore even for the corrupt ioc.
there is no sound reason to connect the ban to their long standing pattern of propping up any regime antagonistic to the us.
in soviet russia, olympics win you.
no need for comrade to participate in lose game and ceremony.
“hey you’re a good friend...don’t show up to the olympics” - nk to russia why would russia help the us sanction north korea,when russia is itself under sanctions imposed by the us?
they're just doing a logical tit for tat geopolitical response.
standard operating procedure comrade edit: they"re i think it goes a bit further than that - baiting the us into another multi-_trillion_ dollar war would be a significant equalizer.
not really.
north korea is strategically somewhere russia and china both dont want the usa.
nobody has to do that though, we'll just do it.

trumpalized edit i'm human not a bot.
now im probably considered a bot call me when russia gives a shit about what us wants what does the us want?
ok we'll do the exact opposite of that -russia that is basically their foreign policy.
deep state 48 d chess: get trump elected so he would do opposite of everything obama wanted... so russia would do the opposite of that thereby doing what obama wanted.
thanks, obama!
also sounds like trump's policies.
that said, russia's economy is based around oil and a us nk war would probably shoot the price up.
why would russia try to help the us though?
that's like saying "the us is aiding syrian rebels with money and weapons, ignoring russian efforts to support assad."

a rare flash of style from /u/autotldr &gt; don't miss: super earth k2-18b: exoplanet that could harbour extraterrestrial life has a neighbor hiding behind it.
holy shit, i've never been more worried about north korea and its neighbor, russia.
i wonder if that super earth has a super russia helping a super north korea.
and a super super nintendo maybe truly, the brightest time line.
maybe you should have reduced it by 81% you're welcome!
&gt; the price of fuel in north korea has plummeted over the past month thanks to russian oil imports, according to reports that suggest russia is ignoring international efforts to isolate the rogue north korean regime.
&gt; don't miss: super earth k2-18b: exoplanet that could harbour extraterrestrial life has a neighbor hiding behind it.
"we do know that russia has given north korea some oil in the past, and i believe that there were some reports that north korea was using ships to get around the security council sanctions that would hide the origin of the oil."
&gt; providing north korea with oil could be russia's way of rej sitting here in britain with the craziness that is brexit going on around us, and somehow the usa still manages to make us feel better about our situation.
britain is like the guy at the family dinner who mistakenly trusted a fart and shit itself, but it's okay, because in bursts a drunk uncle sam to take the attention away, with a hooker on each arm, who then snorts a line of coke, takes a shit on the carpet while shouting racist slurs and then passes out while trying to fuck the washing machine.
sounds like uncle sam knows how to have fun he's not sitting in his own shit either.
there is nothin substantive in this report.
the evidence is literally, “russia has sold to north korea in the past.” i wouldn't be surprised if we found out later that they have been helping their missile program.
anything to undermine the us haha.
i'm counting on it.
putin has explained his stance in the past so this is not surprising.
his stance is that cutting off oil supply could force nk into desperation to the point of starting a war.
this is much the same reason china has been so hesitant to cut off all resources from nk (along with obvious economical reasons).
russia is trying to prevent war as the flux of refugees could cripple surrounding economies, such as their own.
us doesn’t have to worry about that as much being thousands of miles of ocean away.
also, russia doesn’t want nk to start a war and get overthrown for america to gain more influence in the region.
&gt; his stance is that cutting off oil supply could force nk into desperation to the point of starting a war.
not at all unprecedented.
the embargo on japan didn't stop their aggressive expansion, it forced their hand into taking lands that had oil.
...and attacking pearl harbor.
well that was when other world powers were already gearing up for war.
japan anticipated a war would come and thought the us could be crippled earlier.
they also want to use the weaken us naval presence to take over and colonize all of the pacific including the philipines, korea and french indo china.
japan would have done this with or without us oil.
this guy knows his stuff.
i just finished watching ww2 in color today.
that's a great series.
if you like history you also need to do the dan carlin hardcore history series.
start with the mongols.
how dare russia not do what america says.
is russia colluding with trump it not?
hard to keep up with reddit :( remember when everyone and the media ridiculed and laughed at mitt romney for saying russia should be looked at as an enemy.
it's almost like media commentary in america is so uninformed it's basically useless.
:/ i'd say 30-50% our media is basically **e!
** entertainment news now.
the rest of it isn't bad, but it's easier for people to watch e!
than watch something that is more informative and less interesting.
we need to focus on kids man... educate them well when they're young, engage them, etc.
the adults of today (especially older adults) aren't going to stop watching fox news or whatever the equivalent liberal news is.
plus with newspapers dying, people read just about anything online now... not papers with a *lean* to the left or right.
now its heavily right or left websites.
yup.
go look at r/politics posts from that time.
they are classic.
some say romney is stuck in the cold war era when obama has finally warmed relations.
needless to say, lol on that one.
(even more classic is some users are still posting today) north korea as a rouge state in east asia benefits everybody working in opposition to the usa.
russia benifits most of all.
they are using their slave labor in russian towns for private contractors.
imagine how the unemployed russian laboror feels having to compete against a north korean slave labor gang.
in all honesty, who the fuck is listening to the us anymore anyways.
edit: jesus fucking christ, i should have said this was a rhetorical question to avoid the shit show.
like 1/3 of americans.
there sure is butt hurt on both sides.
different tactics, different battle grounds, but the same old conflict.
the cold war never ended for putin.
yes, because shooting missiles over japan is so much less bad than threatening to intervene.
well they could do what china did, actively intervene against america so many times (vietnam/korean war) until nixon gave up and decided to normalize relationships.
(plus china nuclearized) nk cannot "actively intervene" economically, politically or by conventional military means.
all they can do is lob missiles and ordinance, threatening to do serious but not fatal damage to sk, japan, china, and maybe the us.
not exactly a position of strength, unless they are completely backed up into a corner, and even then they won't inflict enough damage to win.
there is no major win either by normalizing relationships with nk.
suddenly we have access to 25 million starving people who haven't had functioning economy, society, rule of law, etc.
for several generations now... no thank you, says the rest of the world.
getting them up to speed would now require trillions of dollars of investment, trillions better spent elsewhere.
all signs point to nk remaining the shithole it is indefinitely.
&gt; 25 million starving people who haven't had functioning economy, society, rule of law, etc.
for several generations now this is what is wrong with the world today, immoral people happy to sit around and enjoy their short lives contently while watching others suffer, die from malnutrition, disease, or both.
&gt; getting them up to speed would now require trillions of dollars of investment, trillions better spent elsewhere.
yea, nice of u to put a price tag on the value of millions of humans money/capitalism need not apply, everything can be subsidized via volunteers and/or donations.
it's not a statement about ethics, it's a statement about likely outcomes.
take a look at how slowly and costly the acquisition of e germany was when the iron curtain fell.
i agree it's heart breaking, but we don't have the means to fix it and we can't rely on others to see it the way we do.
it actually is.
it's a media manipulation that people suddenly believe it's a new thing.
all these satellites orbiting earth got there by being launched and they continue to be there in the same way.
except sattelites arent designed to carry nuclear bombs and neither do they crash into our territorial oceans actually almost all modern designs are repurposed icbms and yes they do crash everywhere on their way down http://spaceflight101.com/falcon-9-jcsat-16/spacex-rocket-parts-rain-down-over-indonesia/ they crash everywhere, not in a target area.
why are we even comparing these two things?
its ridiculous.
shooting icbms into enemy waters does not equal a sattelite.
that's the stupidest thing i've read today.
the process of crashing and falling in "a target area" is the same.
things fall down and the probabilities of hitting an area are equally known.
you can have perfectly viable dual purpose icbm or satellite.
there is no technical distinction.
and north korea tried that - remember they launched a satellite few years back and still got the same shit for it.
because everybody knows it's exactly the same thing.
there is a clear difference of intent.
it's not in any way comparable beyond the specific technologies utilized.
what do you mean?
it's not clear at all.
north korea launched a satellite over japan in the 90s and got the exact same shit they are getting today.
what's the intent of launching a satellite?
half the satellites out there are for spying and more recently the us started with completely undisclosed payload and purpose.
a satellite can easily be just a bomb that decelerates into a preselected location.
difference being they aren't launching satellites and we coordinate heavily with our neighbors.
here i totally agree with you, they should send out notification even they are rejected, they may actually do that and we will never see it though.
but it's more nuanced because north korea tried to send a notam once for a satellite in the 90s and japan got their allies to deny it and they were ridiculed for even trying.
they don't send notices to other countrues because if there is a failure then it's very public.
now that there success rate is higher, they might.
media manipulation against north korea is extreme and the public perception on the matter is about as perverse as it can be.
in this case north korea is correct.
it is committed to making progress in the arms race.
it not only has a lot of catching up to do but can expect to be attacked if it falls far enough behind.
on the other hand the usa is saying it will attack if north korea progresses beyond a point it is already close to reaching.
[damned if you do damned if you don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catch-22).
breaking: north korea threatens to threaten more vigorously us responds: 'well, oh yah?'
us options: withdraw from korea: aint going to happen but its an option.
accept a nuclear armed korea: aint going to happen because it will uncork the djinni.
war: aint going to happen.
no one wants it because it would lead to an end of the nk regime, a decimation of the sk economy and potentially an attack on the us and an implosion of the world economy.
status quo: there you have it.
only one that wins.
we will have decades more of the same, just like the israel and palestine conflict.
yes, it's starting to feel like that old cartoon where the sheepdog and the wolf stop fighting, punch out, and go home until the next day.
option 5: quietly groom a replacement head of state then wait for the right time for kimmy to have a heart attack or fall down some stairs.
that was china's plan.
but kim killed all of them.
&gt; status quo: can't happen, since to everyone's surprise, nk's missile program is making real advancements.
i'm the opposite of a warmonger, but i don't see how this can end without violence, unless lil kim chokes on a chicken bone or something and an adult takes over.
watch "rules for rulers".
there is no adult that's going to take over and change policy.
the insiders of the regime stand to lose everything if the regime falls.
kim looks like a fool from the outsiders perspective, but he is playing a calculated game of ruling his kingdom.
noone going to force him from power and sell their country out to the west without certain assurances that their posistion will remain the same or improve with him out of power.
they know we are going to punish every single person of power within north korea.
we can never give them the assurances and benifits that kim can.
if you believe that one night kim will just dissappear and our problems will be solved you don't understand the heirachy of political control.
&gt; war: aint going to happen.
no one wants it oh, you might be very surprised about that.
there's a *whole* lot of money to be made if a war was to break out.
if it stayed conventional, but if nukes get thrown around, all bets are off (pun intended).
not to mention the whole 3000°f thingy if unlucky enough to be in a blast radius.
also not enough attention is being paid to chemical and biological weapons imho, used conventionally or unconventionally.
all that said, doubt nk has a first strike capability or options not resulting in its own destruction within an hour... nukes will most likely not be used, the us doesnt need to, and we should be able to shoot down any of their missiles if they launch.
maybe nk gets lucky and is able to sneak one in, or they might try to detonate one close to the border.
imo the north korean leadership would use a variety of nukes .... that's why they've got them, ... but only in a last ditch middle-finger scenario (as they'd be vaporized soon after).
not sure our abm is 100% effective against icbms either (a chance the d.c. beltway will need to chance).
of course there'd be warning signs beyond the us just adding more planes to a scheduled exercise and the predictably "upset" nk reaction to all these events.
&gt; we should be able to shoot down any of their missiles if they launch this is a greatly overestimated defense.
all throughout gulf war i we were told patriot missiles were shooting down scud missiles.
the reality was that we likely shot down absolutely none of them.
the tech is likely still not there and is certainly not proven.
&gt; we should be able to shoot down any of their missiles if they launch.
&lt;citations needed&gt; if north korea were to be invaded they would nuke everything around them south korea and japan.
maybe the us wouldn't be hit but uhhh sk and japan would no longer exist.
maybe the icbm technology isnt up to par to threaten the world but make no mistake about it they can deal massive amounts of damage around them.
they have plenty of long tested missiles to carry nukes short distances.
how?
nk has 30 year old missile tech, and the us has several different counter missile technologies, and those are only the ones we know about.
their only solution is to make hundreds of missiles and hope one gets by.
it definitely would not come close to ending sk or japan.
maybe 10s of thousands die in seoul, but that is the extent.
where to begin.
30 year old missile tech literally means nothing.
the us employs minuteman iii as its #1 icbm delivery system.
they are almost 50 years old.
the most widely used cost effective space launch vehicle the soyuz is also about 50 years old.
point being rocket technology has not changed much.
"their only solution is to make hundreds of missiles and hope one gets by" you pretty much answered your own question nk literally has thousands yes thousands of ballistic missiles and artillery pointed at sk, japan and guam at all times.
its projected nk has enough material for 60 nukes.
on top of this nk has a chemical weapons stockpile rivaling russia.
i cringe when people talk about war with north korea like it would be some easy thing no....not even close.
worst than ww2 easily.
you are talking about a country that has been preparing to be invaded for the last 60 years.
for christ sakes were in afghainistan and iraq fighting some dudes in the desert with 40 year old ak-47s living in caves and were still fuckin around over there and you think a war with nk will be a walk in the park.....lol.
you might consider me a "libtard" but yeah everything your saying here is right.
anyone counting on anti-ballistic missile technology is betting on a largely untested technology as far as practical application is concerned.
the missiles on the other hand have worked more or less the way they were designed since the v2.
north korea has valid countermeasures to aggression and a pretty strong position at the negotiating table that will only get better as they build more bombs and more missiles.
there is no way out of this deadlock without both sides being willing to concede at some level.
&gt;but if nukes get thrown around, all bets are off (pun intended) there was a pun?
stockpickers humor ... ok.... what's the pun?
for the non stockpickers in the crowd?
also a whole lot of loss if it were to break out too.
rule of acquisition 34. this is literally a paradox.
the status quo is to watch as nk gets closer and closer to being armed with nukes capable of reliably hitting the us.
arm taiwan with nuclear weapons so china is in the same situation the u.s.is in.
then we can both remove the weapons from our satellite states and problem solved.
nothing is going to happen now because china doesn’t give a shit that nk has nukes.
arming taiwan is an easy way to remedy that problem aslong as we promise to remove them once nk gives them up too.
lol, if you are familiar with china's constitution, it actually says if foreign power(i.e.
us) tries to change the current status quo, there will be immediate military action to take over taiwan.
taiwan will be leveled for even trying to obtain nuclear weapons the status quo changes every time the u.s. sends weapons.
even if china thinks it does, who gives a shit.
it’s ridiculous to think china is allowed to attack taiwan and the u.s. cant attack north korea.
sending obsolete weapons to taiwan and charging a premium is not the same as providing nuclear capability.
also, by your logic, it would be ridiculous to think us is allowed to attack nk and china can't attack taiwan this is why that will never happen: nk isn't controlled by china and in many ways wants to be difficult with them as well.
taiwan is a part of china (its the us policy) and placing nukes there is inconsistent with that policy and would likely be a core issue that would be a red line for china.
the closest thing we could do is deploy nukes in korea or support the development of them is sk or japan.
neither of which is likely if that was true we would not be able to send them any weapons.
if china is willing to attack taiwan because we put nuclear weapons there we need to be willing to attack north korea for the same reason, you want to make the problem go away but your solution is going to make the problem worse.
we should just treat n.korea like it doesn't exist.
don't report on their statements, don't respond to their threats, don't recognize them as a country, ban any and all travel and trade with them.
let's just treat that area of the world as if it were a void.
they seem to get off on our attention so let's deprive them of it.
might have worked under obama while their nuclear tech was less developed and stifle further work towards a missile.
instead, the world had just been kicking this down the road praying kim realizes that there is no endgame where he'll be on top could not do that with trump.
he can't resist adolescent fight posturing.
i mean to be fair, threats from nk have been news headlines for many many years before trump even took office.
ignoring then isn't an option because of the media and news reporting, *not* who sits in the oval office.
yes.
let us leave alone a maniacal dictator who is developing nuclear weapons while simultaneously enforcing the worst living conditions in the entire known world.
what could go wrong.
common misconception.
north korea doesn't provide the worst living conditions.
and kim is no more maniacal than your average president.
edit: just imagine if there is a country where there is simply not enough food to feed everybody and are under sanctions like north korea.
and pick your favorite president, what do you think they will do?
he has to pick who will starve.
no way around it.
most likely he will step down to hand power to someone with balls to make the choice though.
which country has worse living conditions than north korea?
from what i've heard there is none.
you do realize there are actual warlords doing daily random purges in africa right?
people starving to death in the millions.
iraq/syria are pretty rought and very violent.
bolivia, philippines - starvation and homicide on the streets in rural areas.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_life_expectancy north korea has total order and discipline at least so yeah it sucks but not nearly as much.
the prisoner population is not even that great compared to us for example.
yes but there is also a chance that they will take larger measures to gain back that attention north korea seems to have become the kid who's tough through the fence.
how many times can one country threaten to rain fire before people start rolling their eyes and sighing.
this is the exact question north korea is asking, because ... you know suddenly there are 3 carriers parked next to them, a bunch of bombers and fighters and doing decapitation exercises every year within 1 mile of the border.
"the boy who cried wolf" comes to mind... good.
i kind of don't care if the world ends right now.
good thing a lot of other people do care and that this decision is not solely in your hands, or even have a voice in the matter.
*yawn* right "lol, k" - usa a couple hundred thousand of us could just go "vacation" in nk.
it seemed to work for russia and anything they can do we can do better.
except topless presidential photos, we best keep all that classified above top secret.
we don't have access to the mental health care such an event would surely require.
if the news is correct, then the oil exports from russia to nk need to be taken out.
this is the best tl;dr i could make, [original](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-statement/north-korea-says-u-s-threats-make-war-unavoidable-as-china-urges-calm-iduskbn1e0393) reduced by 89%.
(i'm a bot) ***** &gt; seoul - two american b-1b heavy bombers joined large-scale combat drills over south korea on thursday amid warnings from north korea that the exercises and u.s. threats have made the outbreak of war &amp;quot;an established fact&amp;quot;.
&gt; china, north korea&amp;#039;s neighbor and lone major ally, again urged calm and said war was not the answer.
&gt; north korea&amp;#039;s latest missile test prompted a warning from the united states that north korea&amp;#039;s leadership would be &amp;quot;utterly destroyed&amp;quot; if war were to break out, a statement that drew sharp criticism from russia.

kim's a sissy.
he won't make the first move he knows he will be completely destroyed.
i can't imagine his army would be willing to fight considering they have zero combat experience.
kim just wants attention like any manchild does i wish we would just bomb the fuck out of them in the middle of the night from all directions.
literally shower and decimate them with the most destructive missiles available.
china is shitting its pants that frankenstein baby will upset its factory economy and all dos "communists" in beijing may have to give up their hookers and sports cars.

how?
there aren't even 200 countries.
there's 193-195 countries depending on how you count.
not sure where they got "over 200 countries" from there are 206 [according to wolfram alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=amount+of+countries) needless to say it was rejected by the us, china and india.
it's alright.
none of those countries pollute very much, anyway.

this means dtjr and kushner lied to mueller.
thats a no-no worth 4 years.
&gt;none of the newly disclosed emails were sent directly to trump jr. he didn't lie to mueller.

&gt; one of the sources familiar with the content of the email downplayed the interaction, saying news of the dnc hack was surprising because in the run-up to the trump tower meeting, the russian participants had promised information on illicit russian funding of the dnc.
but that dirt was not provided to trump jr., kushner and manafort during the meeting, according to accounts from the participants.

be still my heart and still nothing about the children they wanted to adopt... uh oh
as much as i read about astrophysics, and with years of engineering analysis experience, and my general love of science and all that... my brain just cannot comprehend the scale of this thing.
800m solar masses is just so beyond anything in the human experience that i can't even visualize this.
the milky way is roughly 700 billion solar masses, so the black hole in question is roughly 0.11 percent the mass of our galaxy.
i’m not sure if that helps at all.
puts it in “perspective”, but to try to still visualize it...my brain starts to laugh.
thank you for that bit of info.
i wouldn’t touch it to see if its hot thats for sure only big shaq can mans never hot ^^[aaahh](https://youtu.be/xrtbez3k3f8?t=55s) it's hard to visualize a black hole in the darkness of space.
or to see energy waves or immense gravity against a black background ;) that seems like a huge percentage tbh it is, i can’t easily visualize it even with my factoid.
how much of the mass of our galaxy is comprised of black holes though?
likely well over two percent https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/doi/10.1093/mnras/stx1959/4060726/counting-black-holes-the-cosmic-stellar-remnant?guestaccesskey=d1a72ca6-9200-4dca-850a-f4c87663106e the easiest way to think of all that is just..... real big don't black holes eventually explode?
how can something get this big?
and can it just keep growing until the whole universe is a big black hole?
useless scale, people can't comprehend the milky way or 0.11% why wouldn't you use our solar system for scale?
&gt; why wouldn't you use our solar system for scale?
because that was literally the title of the post.
doesnt solar mass mean the mass of our sun, not... the system?
yes, but literally 99.9% of our solar systems mass is the sun, so it's effectively one and the same had to un-up you there, a guy further down has it with a proper-ish source that it's just 99.8% nice try ... the sun is a lot easier to visualise than the solar system.
if anything, telling people to visualise the mass of the solar system would make things more complicated.
the sun comprises 99.8 percent of the solar system's mass &gt;the sun lies at the heart of the solar system, where it is by far the largest object.
it holds 99.8 percent of the solar system's mass and is roughly 109 times the diameter of the earth — about one million earths could fit inside the sun.
https://www.space.com/58-the-sun-formation-facts-and-characteristics.html you can accurately comprehend the mass off the solar system?
1 in 1,000 isn't that hard to picture if you've ever had it physically put in front of you.
as a kid i had blocks that came in 1x1x1, 1x1x10, 1x10x10, and 10x10x10 segments.
i can picture 100 and 1,000 pretty easily by thinking about those blocks.
is it also easy to imagine 1000^900000 of those blocks?
we tiny humans can't comprehend the vastness of space.
&gt; 700 0.11 % of 700 billion is 770m solar masses so milky way black hole is a little smaller the milky way black hole is 4 million solar masses.
800/700000 is 0.114285714 percent, i rounded to 0.11 &gt;&gt;der mangel an mathematischer bildung gibt sich durch nichts so auffallend zu erkenne, wie durch maßlose schärfe im zahlenrechnen.
&gt;- carl friedrich gauß - someone else, per https://books.google.de/books?id=xcnir4i07owc&amp;pg=pa248&amp;dq=zugeschriebener there is a good video on this on youtube if it haven't seen it before: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgndao7m41m i love this video.
the music is so spooky and just when i think my jaw won't drop any lower, it unhinges itself i guess you could drop a pube in your living room, that would about sum it up.
'1 solar mass' seems easier to comprehend only because the number is small.
but the sun itself is beyond anything one can really wrap their head around.
quite the handful... this is a gif that kinda puts it into perspective.
a super massive black hole of 20 million solar masses.

like, it's not even willing to *try* to understand a number that large.
even with the distance of the thing - 13.1 billions light years away.
it means that light (travelling at 300 000 km/s) still took 13 *billion* years to reach us from around this thing.
that distance ... i just ... i can't even come close to comprehending how far away this thing is.
what get's me is that even if we could travel the speed of light it would still take us 13 billion years to get there... 13.1 billion light years away ?
isnt that about how old the universe was predicted to be ?

&gt; yes, this bh existed very early after the big bang.
someone burped right after big bang fascinating &gt;existed would it have "evaporated" already?
black holes of that magnitude would take trillions upon trillions of years to evaporate.
ehm no, not enough time has passed.
it's more likely larger now.
i should have said "existed as we now see it".
large black holes evaporate at a much slower rate than smaller black holes.
all stellar mass and above back holes are actually increasing in size, because they're absorbing mass from the cosmic background radiation more than they're emitting it.
they will only start to evaporate in the far future.
smaller black holes, on the order of a megaton of matter would radiate away much faster, imagine a petawatt gamma ray source yes - i wonder if that “baby” mass really can be compared with normal mass.
right, but it the 'observable universe' is about 46 billion light years in radius because of expansion.
i don't know what that means or how it helps, but there you go.
no, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 by.
so... you didn't read the article?
my bad, forgot where i was for a moment.
800 million suns of space got defragged and formatted!!
the universe is a simulation running in windows me confirmed.
ah..the [windows me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddratttbdne) that's a nice way of seeing it!
lmao.
dude.
thank you for making my day brighter so, in other words, there was a 800 million solar mass black hole in the universe just 600 million years after the big bang?
crazy.
no, not necessarily.
i don't know how the math works exactly, but the observable universe is 46 billion light years due to the expansion of space.
the same expansion happened between us and the black hole of course, so it might have formed as late as 6 billion years after the big bang.
i did some very bad and suspect math to come to that 6b, but i think the idea is right.
they dated it to just 690 million years after the big bang.
that's why it's so unusual.
that amount of mass *shouldn't* have been able to form into a single black hole in that time period.
it's right in the article: &gt; the object — detailed in studies published today in nature and the astrophysical journal letters — gives us a great snapshot of the past.
it’s so far away that its light has taken around 13.1 billion years to reach us.
and since the big bang is thought to have occurred 13.8 billion years ago, astronomers are seeing this black hole as it looked when the universe was just 690 million years old.
on the cosmological timescale, that’s basically when the universe was a mere toddler.
hmmm.
i'm not understanding something.
i don't trust myself on this, so i'm sure the article is more right than me.
the published article it does indicate the black hole existed at that time, i wonder what else i am missing.
is there a distinction between the object currently being 13.1 billion light years away and it taking 13.1 bly for the light to reach us?
the studies are published in *nature* and *astrophysical journal letters*, and are open for peer review.
here are the original articles if you care to read them; they make pretty clear the significance of the red shift of these quasars and resulting distance indicating their existence in the very-early universe: https://www.nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature25180 http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa943a i don't have a direct answer to your question, but the articles make it clear that they understand the age in relation to the universe to be accurate.
thanks!
you're right, i forgot about the expansion.
&gt; the observable universe is 46 billion light years due to the expansion of space wrong term... we can only observe things at the speed of light, so we can only observe things at distances up to just after the big bang.
the universe is bigger because that edge of the universe we see extends just as far in the other direction at the present time, but the light from over there can't reach us right now.
and the theory of dark energy and expansion says that light won't reach our descendants either, we'll always outrun it.
well i don't think that's quite right either.
objects that emitted light 13 billion years ago now could be 46 billion light years away.
i guess that's what i meant i'm just figuring out this observable universe stuff.
so forgive me.
i'm figuring it out too!
my understanding is that every spot in the universe is the same, as in from every point it looks like you are in the middle and everything is 13-14b years away.
so from that black hole right now, the "other direction" away from us extends out 13-14b light years.
they see light from that direction that our part of the universe will never see.
&gt; wrong term... what would be the correct term?
the expansion corrected radius of the observable universe is in fact ~46 billion light years, although obviously that can not be directly observed, and that distance measure is not commonly used in observational cosmology.
observable has a pretty specific meaning, doesn't it?
as in, light has reached us?
it's a sincere question, if "observable" has a different meaning among astronomers, that things we can't observe are still defined that way in some circumstances, it wouldn't surprise me.
if you mean "observable from here or from that black hole or from another blackhole the same distance in the other direction", well that's a stretch.
to your question, "observable and unobservable" or "actual including the unobservable" would be more accurate based on the definition as i understand it.
it's not a question of observable or not observable.
due to expansion, a cosmological object that we now see at a certain distance has moved away from us since the light that we now see was emitted by the object.
i wonder what's there now?
maybe a bigger black hole?
so that means they're seeing the black hole 13 billion years ago?
roughly wait so what the fuck does that mean a light year is a unit which measures the distance light travels in a years time within a vacuum.
because the smbh is 13 billion light years away, it's taken all of that electromagnetic radiation 13 billion years to reach us making that information roughly 13 billion years old.
so how many galaxies did it eat to get 800 million solar masses?
according to latest (rough) estimates, thats about 1/1000 the total mass of the milky way, which is estimated at around 700 billion solar masses.
edit: that mass estimate is according to the very long baseline array (wow astronomers are great at naming stuff) which measured the velocity of stars on the rim of our galaxy.
math gets you gravity and total orbital mass to sustain those speeds.
i assume that takes into account dark matter which means that this black hole is actually closer to one percent of the mass of all the "normal matter" in our galaxy.
to be fair, the array is like 30 miles.
and that is very long.
&gt; so how many galaxies did it eat to get 800 million solar masses?
this bh exists during the era of re-ionization, when galaxies first started forming, so it probably did not eat any galaxies.
also its mass is only a small fraction of an average galaxy.
it's also likely to be far larger now since we're seeing it as it existed 13 billion years ago.
it also could be a fraction of it's size with hawking radiation.
from what i know about black hole evaporation (not much), it occurs extremely slowly.
on the order of hundreds of billions to trillions of years correct.
and given this, only extremely small black holes really have any chance of shrinking unless the hole is located in the most desolate of space wastelands ...so a primordial black hole?
is this the first of those they've found?
nope.
there is a few of them.
essentially they have found black holes that are too large.
they couldn't have eaten enough stuff for them to become that size in their life span.
so now the question is how they got there?
they are speculating that they skipped being a star and went directly into being a blackhole.
there is a show called "how the universe works" (i think that's the one) that explains this stuff very well.
source on the blackholes that are impossibly large?
my source is the tv show "how the universe works".
i've looked for about 60 min and not been able to find it.
i'm also not sure where to look up the theory.
as for my statement, the issue i believe was that there hasn't been enough time for the super massive blackhole to "eat" enough matter to become that large.
the going from a giant dust cloud to a black hole was one of the possibilities.
sorry, i can't name a source.
primordial black holes are from an even earlier era (and are hypothetical, not observed), although those could grow into a black hole such as this one.
one of [these](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/udfy-38135539) is the right size, but it would be gas and not stars on which it grew fat.
i think for black holes to get that massive, they actually merge/absorb other black holes.
and we know that galaxies collide and merge to form larger galaxies, considering this thing is 13billion light years away, we're looking at a blackhole that was probably created after a bunch of early galaxies collided and merged.
the viral story this year about gravitational waves was the result of 2 black holes merging, so ya.
obligatory, am not an anything, i just like space.
none.
an average galaxy is bigger than that.
galaxies really only exist because of super massive blackholes anyway.
this is the best tl;dr i could make, [original](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/6/16738652/quasar-supermassive-black-hole-early-universe-big-bang) reduced by 89%.
(i'm a bot) ***** &gt; astronomers have spotted the most distant supermassive black hole ever seen in our universe - a behemoth that&amp;#039;s nearly a billion times more massive than our sun.
&gt; &amp;quot;already we can learn a lot about the early universe with this one, but of course you want more,&amp;quot; bram venemans, a black hole researcher at the max planck institute for astronomy who was part of the quasar&amp;#039;s discovery, tells the verge.
&gt; since the universe is expanding, distant quasars are moving away from earth, causing their light to stretch into even longer wavelengths and get &amp;quot;redder.&amp;quot; it&amp;#039;s a concept known as redshift, and it can tell us which quasars are farther out than others.

| *top* *keywords*: **quasar**^#1 **universe**^#2 **light**^#3 **years**^#4 **astronomers**^#5 there's an object far more dense sitting in the oval office these days i was under the impression it was out golfing.
i was under the impression it was in russia, polishing.. things.
i wanted to say that while i agree, this is not the place for that.
but then i realized this is r/worldnews and not r/space.
dammit op &gt;.&lt; ugh... carry on... you aren’t the mod to have any say so, gtfo hillary is not in the oval office?
how can you say that about a woman?
.... wait, .... you meant trump right?
if we assume that the average density of the human body is the same as water, seeing as we are made up of 70% water, then you're actually correct!
swartzchild radius = 2mg/c^2 assuming 1 solar mass is 1.99 x 10^30 kg, 800 million solar masses is 1.592 x 10^39 kg g is the gravitational constant c is the speed of light plug those numbers in and you get 2.364 trillion meters, a distance that would extend past saturn's orbit from the sun.
then you have your simple spherical volume equation: v = 4/3(pi)r^3 plug in your swartzchild radius of 2.364 x 10^12 meters and you get a volume of about 5.5368 x 10^37 cubic meters.
finally, divide the black holes mass (1.592 x 10^39 kg) by the volume (5.5368 x 10^37 cubic meters) to get density.
you end getting 28.753 kg/m^3 making the black hole about a fourth as dense as water at 1000 kg/m^3.
so yes, trump really is more dense than this black hole but so are all the rest of us.
go back to your containment sub.
says the new guy... your mother ?
pathetic comment next time dont fuck with putin okay.
as long as it's way over there.
a creationist will probably doubt this.
no you guys are right, a bunch of nothing created all this nothing which then created more nothing , which then created a “big bang” that created stardust that created “us” makes more sense... nothing?
stuff was always there and always will be.
the big bang is recursive most likely stuff doesn’t just “appear” out of no where idiot.
#fight fight 🍿🍿🎬📽️ thats exactly what i said, the stuff never "appeared" it was always there also, dont get mad :) eggs, rain, sunlight, televisions just “appear” out of no where too right?
that’s the world you live in?
lol what a joke.
there is always a beginning of something.
you have failed to prove your statement and just keep repeating yourself.
so i will”disappear” from this convo since your obviously a 13 yr old troll.
you seem to no get it, thats why i have to repeat myself i mean youre the only one talking about stuff appearing out of nowhere here.
im saying the exact opposite.
&gt;there is always a beginning of something source?
time began somewhere huh?
matter too?
energy too?
that doesnt make sense sorry then what created god?
and what created what created god?
and so on?
something came from something were currently refer to as nothing wether you believe in god or not.
&gt; there is always a beginning of something.
except for god, amiright?
so where did it come from?
who said it did?
obviously it does.
everything had to come from somewhere.
even you believe god made everything.
where did he come from?
where did he create the universe?
oh baby, don't you know i suffer?
oh baby, can you hear me moan?
it's crazy how our brains have hard time visualizing size on massive scale and size on atomic scale.
now this news is out of this world!
*caaaarlooos* is that 800m solar masses (sm) 13.1b years ago or 800m sm now?
that is reaally really massive !
which means that supermassive black holes formed in the first 0.7 billion years after the big bang.
but the milky way formed in the first 0.2 billion years after the big bang.
if black holes played a large role in galaxy formation, we should expect to find black holes from even earlier.
either that, or black holes didn't play as much of a role in galaxy formation as we thought.
will it blend?
no but i reckon a hydraulic press would take care of it.
lol.
&gt; it’s so far away that its light has taken around 13.1 billion years to reach us.
and since the big bang is thought to have occurred 13.8 billion years ago, astronomers are seeing this black hole as it looked when the universe was just 690 million years old.
this is just insane to wrap your head around.
keep in mind that this also means that someone who was 10000 light years away from us could have been watching earth as human civilization grew.
okay, that would require some kind of ridiculous technology that probably doesn't exist.
but still, it'd be sweet to find some incredibly advanced alien civilization, and be able to ask them about how that whole story with jesus really went down.
you know, right before those aliens enslaved us all, made pets out of us, and put is in zoos and labs.
i don't know, it might be kind of sweet to be a pet to an alien race.
i would want my collar's tag to read "sprinkles".
the real question is if i get to poop in their zero-g yard.
you know what gravitational lensing is, right?
so find a gravitational lens 100000000 ly away that wraps light 180 degrees.
get a really big telescope and look at earth, 100 million years ago.
dinosaurs.
no.
fucking.
way.
oh, that is so crazy.
so in the event that we ever figure out how to travel faster than light (impossible, but just roll with me here).
if we could travel faster than light, and if you could create a telescope that could adjust itself to focus on earth as we flew away from it, we could watch the entire history of human civilization in reverse.
i can only imagine how many physicists would roll their eyes so hard at this statement that they would fall out of their heads, but yeah.
86 comments and it makes me happy that nobody wrote about op's mom yet.
there's hope for reddit!
everyone is confused so let me sum up: that's a big fucking hole!
so when do we get sucked in?
so we are seeing it from 13.1 billion years ago?
so for all we no it could not even still be there?
see, we assume it it be a black hole because it have some of the chacteristics of a black hole, such as its massive gravity well.
but as people have mentioned, it is too early in the universe for such a black hole to form.
so clearly it's something else.

* the recent leaks about saudi arabia planning to have diplomatic relations with israel are good news for weed smoking saudi as myself.
off topic, how do you guys in saudi arabia feel about normalizing relationship with israel.
greetings from tel-aviv.
you don't know?
we hate your guts to be true.
but not all of the saudis feel the same way.
there's a trend i see on twitter that increasing numbers are in favor of normalizing relationship with israel.
personally, i do not have a final stand of this since it's a dense subject and i like to take my time before making my opinion about the matter.
however, having a less than 3 hours fly time destination which is organized, culturally rich, high sense of safety, with respecting the human rights, access to great weed is a great selling point to me.
hopefully, this matter get resolved and we all go pass it in no time.

they need to focus on exporting the equipment involved, not the products.

israel has a solid manufacturing sector for expensive high tech equipment.
china excels in cheap shit.

i love the ignorance in the comments.
palestinians become violent but its always some one else's fault.
you act as if they have no agency over their actions.
keep playing into hamas just like when israel mows down a few dozens palestinians it is always the corpses' fault somehow.
oh yeah they are always just minding their own business.
they never fire rockets or shoot at isrealies, commit any terror activity nah nah not like israel, who never lobs missiles at palestinian cities, or demolishes palestinian homes, or confiscates palestinian land, nah nah.
you mean the isreal that offered the palestinians a state and the west bank twice?
trust me if they wanted to just go kill them all they would.
maybe when hamas agrees israel has the right to exist, we can move forward.
why are they all up in arms about this?
because the supposed "honest broker" just declared their occupied capital is actually the capital of its occupier.
so how do you suggest we deal with it?
the best way to deal with it was to do nothing.
this was completely unnecessary, and the backlash that was going to be produced everyone saw a mile away.
there's no benefit to this to anyone but israel.
it's not in us interests.
it puts america again in the crosshairs as a terror target, and it's not like terrorist attacks haven't already occurred.
you as in the us or israel?
either way, recognizing palestine with east jerusalem as its capital would be a step in the right direction.
so giving them what they want?
&gt; their occupied capital whose occupied capital?
israel's?
it disgusts me that this move is being used as an excuse for violence and terrorism.
they even warned there would be violence before the decision and nobody took issue with this, like it's acceptable?
if they are on a higher moral level than the us and israel then the best way to respond to this is through diplomacy; they can't say trump is derailing the peace process when they are doing the opposite of working towards getting it back on course to be honest, i think most people in the american government foreign relations workers are completely sick of the problems around palestine and israel.
it's a miracle people still even try to attempt to get peace between the two in a diplomatic way instead of forcing said peace to happen.
fine.
then let's stop subsidising one side and walk away.
i absolutely agree with you, but i could tell you right now it would not have the effect you're hoping for: * israel's budget is 261 billion and it receives 3 billion dollars in aid yearly.
making it merely **1.1% of israel's budget**.
* the plo's budget is 4.48 billion, and it received 721 million in us foreign aid in 2016. that amounts to **16% of the plo's budget**.
israel can afford the removal of foreign aid.
the plo and its "kill jews and get paid for a lifetime" program and the massive pilfering of foreign aid by high level fatah officials would be severely affected.
if the eu dropped any aid, that'd be another huge chunk of their budget.
i'd love for everyone on both sides to stop feeding money into the conflict, because all it does is draw corrupt demagogues looking to line their pockets, and not real statesmen who are willing to be rational and willing to make the concessions for peace and break this cycle.
sadat was a statesman, and a brave man.
hussein was a statesman and a brave man.
arafat and abbas have been nothing but thieves turned billionaires.
i'd rather have them stop subsidising both ways and make them do this without outside influence.
if you do that, then you will definitely have a war within a month.
absolutely both sides will have no incentive not to just obliterated the other one.
nature should indeed take its course.
this is true but violence from one side won't work and america wading in using military power to resolve conflicts hasn't been that successful in recent history, has it?
america's peaceful attempts at solving the conflict there have also not worked, i really do not see either side backing off from their demands and fear that the only way out is war for these two parties.
neither side will back down because the palestinians refuse to a 2 state solution and want israel's complete demise.
perhaps not under bibi, it is actually feasible for israel to agree to peace but it won't happen because unfortunately the other side to do not want to coexist with them.
war would be a bad solution and it's clear who would win, unless other countries get involved which would be highly probable.
although it is the worst solution, it would possibly lead to more peace.
this is likely to prove a very unpopular comment but this is my opinion based around facts and each sides intent and ideologies.
why is it always about 'excuses' or 'justifications' when it comes to this particular brand of violence?
because only the most fragile sort of person would be offended by someone recognizing objective facts.

it’s not like they are a reasonable people no, they're not.
which is why it was fucking stupid to set them off on another insurgency for *no fucking advantage to the us whatsoever*.
it's the same as trump's support for police brutality: it doesn't achieve anything and makes crime worse.
but then perhaps trump wants muslims rioting and worsening crime.
it allows his hatred-stoking to pay beter returns.
at this point bowing to palestine's asinine demands is just dumb.
there's no reason to give a fuck about what palestine thinks until they get their shit together.
if north korea gets butthurt about our troops being stationed in south korea does that mean we should give in to their temper tantrum and withdraw our forces just to "pursue peace"?
fuck no.
just because some violent maniac pretends that they are interested in peace for 1 second doesn't mean you suddenly give in to all their demands because they might throw a temper tantrum.
when the israelis left the gaza strip did the inhabitants live in peace with israel after israel gave them what they wanted?
nope they fired rockets at israel.
so by gentle breeze, you mean a brutal occupation that has gone on for decades while systematically confiscating more of their land?
maybe if arabs hadn't tried to wipe israel off the map half a dozen times they might have some of that land today.
this isn't israeli's fault.
they didn't start this conflict.
you have to be joking.
so you think its perfectly normal for 'athiest' zionist foriegners to mass immgrate to already occupied areas and not assimilate to create their own country on 'holy' land.
there are even zionists who knew this would be a problem.
sounds a lot like what's happening in europe right now.
mass immigration and the occupy already occupied land... it is not the same.
although there are no good guys/bad guys and there is rarely enough nuance in this conversation, it isn't fair to compare creating a nation-state in the middle of existing nation-states with an increase in immigration.
and is that a good thing?
no it isnt.
but you defend them, and scorn israel.
they went from a position of being in the right to being in the wrong.
just because they didn't start the war doesn't justify a permanent occupation of other people's land without giving them the vote in the ruling authority.
nor does it justify demolishing their homes while settling your own ethnicity to gradually ethnically cleanse the land.
maybe if jews hadn't performed the first terrorist attacks in the region, and named streets after said terrorists and ended up getting what they wanted... palestinians wouldn't think they could achieve the same thing in the same way.
i think we should stop talking about who started what first considering this whole debacle is thousands of years old.
[actually, it is exactly 100 years old.
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balfour_declaration) perhaps they should be a little better at defending “their land” if they want to keep it.
six day war, it's a tough nation when a war last only days and they win.
i'd like to see palestine try a war with israel.
holy fuck what?
i’m saying israel could occupy palestine tomorrow and there’s not a damn thing palestine could do about it.

like every group of people has for 2000+ years he's saying the same thing the israel pm has publicly said: israel will always "live by the sword".
of course, he forgets the rest of jesus' statement in matthew.
it's become a fun game to spot propagandists on reddit.
just look at the [top subreddits and most frequently used words](https://atomiks.github.io/reddit-user-analyser/#illbeanicefella).
we've got a little far right troll over here.
far right troll might be a reach.
more like unabashed conservative.
i’m flattered you think i have the influence to be a propagandist though thank you.
hmm.
let's see your feet.
trump somehow *forced* these people to "violently clash"?
how exactly does that work?
mind control?
he said something they didn't like or something succinctly put.
what was accomplished by making this announcement?
can you answer my question first?
then i'll respond.
did trump cause this solely by the announcement?
no.
but certainly it was a factor, however minor.
which begs the question, why make this announcement?
what exactly does it accomplish?
to me it seems like turning up the heat on a pot that is already boiling.
it seems like something that was done solely so trump could claim a "win" with his supporters.
but i'm no expert on this matter so if this actually did something useful please enlighten me.
why was it "a factor" in the "violent clashes"?
again: did trump somehow *force* these people to riot?
trump's supporters have almost gotten tired of winning, he's come through on so many of his campaign processes, so he didn't need a "win".
are you aware that trump's three predecessors - obama, gwb, and clinton - all promised during their campaigns to move our embassy to jerusalem?
why did they make that promise?
the difference between them and trump is that trump is actually doing what he said he would.
can you answer my question first?
then i'll respond.
i asked first, and you still haven't answered.
and i am guessing is "because the answer is inconvenient".
i would say it was a factor due to the fact that multiple groups and individuals in the region, including some israelis, stated that this was not a good time to make this announcement and that it would inflame tensions and could result in violence or attacks.
so what did this accomplish for the us?
&gt; could result in violence or attacks.
because trump said a thing the palestinians didn't like.
they seem to not like a whole lot, starting with the very existence of the state of israel.
this is precisely the way abusive spouses treat their victims: "if you do that, i'll go off on you."
it's not a relationship, as somebody on reddit said; it's a hostage situation.
and you know what?
not only does it never end; it escalates.
the palestinians will always be raging about something.
there is no appeasing them save the destruction of israel.
so there is no point in paying attention to their threats.
that is one thing this accomplished for the us: stating that we are going to do what *we* think best rather than give in to what in effect is extortion.
it's a message to other countries as well: we're not going to do/not do something just because you threaten a case of the vapors over it.
we're over that.
second, congress showed its intent on this more than 2 decades ago.
three previous presidents have promised it.
obviously *they* thought it was important; otherwise they wouldn't have campaigned on it.
the time for dicking around is over.
are there any other countries where our embassy is *not* in that nation's declared capitol?
fair enough.
you realise there's a difference between the word "triggers" and the word "forces" right?
you're right.
"forces" is when somebody holds a gun to your head.
"triggers" is when you try to force somebody's hand by threatening to riot, and they call your bluff.
give me your address, i'll make sure some people come over to crash in your place .. see how you're gonna react.
edit: already downvoted me mate ?
don't you wanna learn how i could force you to become "violent" so you can stop acting surprised ?
not me downvoting you; idc what you say.
yeah sure, and don't worry i already expected that you'd be a hypocrite but had hoped for something more...creative.
that said, feel free to have the last word.
this is the exact reason why i agree with what trump did here.
to cause a war?
no, to not give those violent unreasonable fucks any more territory.
jerusalem is better off in the hands of the israelis, they will let everyone worship there freely, if the muslims get it, they will monopolize it as theirs and kick out anyone that’s not muslim.
to show that you will not give in to terrorists.
as another example, look at the white nationalist rally in charlotsville protesting the decision to remove confederate statues, in which an innocent woman was killed.
after that, did people just say "oh, well taking down confederate statues clearly causes violent clashes, so we'll just stop doing it"?
of course not.
i think it was the intention in the first place (among other conflicts that will arise).
if you have fire, throw some gas.
then you send the firefighters.
basically be the solution to the problem you created.
wow, so exactly what everyone thought and said would happen.
everybody that has a brain knows that jerusalem is israel's capital.
it is stupid to deny it.
trump just stated the truth this time, surprisingly.
lol as if these people need an excuse to riot, kill someone, blow themselves up, run over innocents, the list goes on.... lets all blame trump for this violence... religion is a disease [deleted] i don't think there is if they want anyone to hear man, doesn't the president know those people are nuts???
we should just do what they want!
utterly absurd that anyone would put stock in anything playboy chumps says.
using that as an excuse for violence over their religious hallucinations is ridiculous.
hopefully no one died because trump wanted to speak on tv.
imagine thinking so little of the palestinians you think them acting like animals in response to a tv broadcast is trumps fault
important parts from the article: &gt; they discovered that dna was different for gay and straight men around the genes slitrk5 and slitrk6.
&gt; slitrk6 is an important gene for brain development, and is particularly active in a region of the brain which includes the hypothalamus.
&gt; the hypothalamus is crucial for producing the hormones which control sex drive, and previous studies have shown parts of it are up to 34 per cent larger in gay men.
and the conclusion: &gt; gil mcvean, professor of statistical genetics at the university of oxford, also added: “sexuality is likely influenced by many different factors, including environment, experience and, likely, some aspects of innate biological variation.
&gt; “i can see no major implications of this work or how it could be useful in the future.
&gt; “the genetic effects are far too weak to be of any predictive or diagnostic value.
all biology – including the origins of sexuality – is interesting at some level, but i see no direct applications of such research.” *tl;dr study showed a genetic marker that increases the size of a part of the brain tied to sex drive in gay men.
scientist says its interesting but not a any useful information.
* do identical twins often have the same sexuality (moreso than non-identical twins)?
because you'd expect them to (at least some of the time) if sexuality was somewhat genetic.
haven't looked for the actual study but richard dawkins mentions studies which have shown it is more likely, think it was this video can't check atm though.
https://youtu.be/idmqns78fr8 i remember reading about studies done over a couple decades in australia and the us in a sexuality class i took.
the results posted in 2013 came to the conclusion that male twins have an ~11% and females a ~14% chance to both be gay if one of them is gay.
so, no.
those results were comparable with the general population.
i’m sorry i can’t cite my source.
also sorry that it was back in 2013. one of the article's cited in this article states otherwise with 6 twin studies cited.
&gt; while the usual combination of sex chromosomes (xx or xy) predicts sexual orientation and behavior for the vast majority of humans (as heterosexual), variation exists: a stable minority of men (3~4%) are homosexual1 and male sexual orientation appears to be bimodally distributed with most men rating themselves as predominantly heterosexual (kinsey scale 0–1) or homosexual (kinsey scale 5–6)1,2,3,4,5. male sexual orientation is moderately heritable (30~40%), but is multifactorial, with evidence of multiple genetic and environmental contributions, via family studies6,7,8,9,10,11, twin studies4,12,13,14,15,16, and segregation analyses8,10,11,17.
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-15736-4 i would also like to point out, just as something to keep in mind, that the numbers given by both of us and also everyone else when it comes to this topic could be wrong given cultural stigmas with coming out.
there’s no real way to know how much of the population identifies as something under the queer umbrella.
ya, that could be an issue.
however, wouldn't the stigma cause underestimations overall.
maybe more than 3-4% of the populations is actually homosexual, and maybe that 30-40% heritability is actually higher due to the same reasons.
tough to say.
but, 30-40% heritability is pretty low imo.
however, identical twins shouldn't have the same odds as the general public if this stat is true.
&gt;sexuality is likely influenced by many different factors, including environment, experience and, likely, some aspects of innate biological variation.
given that it is not just genetics, the answer to your question is "not necessarily".
i think he was asking if any actual studies have been done on sexuality in identical twins and their findings.
i missed the word 'often' which coloured my perception of the question's intent.
just anecdotal, but i knew a set of identical twins that were split - one gay, one straight.
i knew twins in houston who were both gay.
really great drag queens too.
i actually know a set of identical twins in which only one of them is gay.
openly anyway.
the other has only ever dated women.
my newhews are identical twins, and one is very gay while one is definatly not.
they are the only twins i know, so i guess it's a small sample pool, but i would say no to your question :) so, mutagens can actually make frogs gay?
im slowly losing hope for humanity here.
it really makes you wonder what qualification these "journalists" needs these days.
this is so true, i have found the tighter my genes the more the boys come running.
typical.
scientist: we may have made a discovery showing a genetic link to homosexuality that needs much more study before anything definitive can be proven media: teh gays are mutants [the science news cycle](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1174)... yup, everyone is a mutant.
so, they haven't, they just found possible genetic correlations in a small, self-defined sample that may effect candor.
pretty much yeah.
i put the important bits in my comment.
jack my candour up, science-man.
this is the best tl;dr i could make, [original](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2017/12/07/genes-linked-homosexuality-discovered-scientists/) reduced by 58%.
(i'm a bot) ***** &gt; genes linked to homosexuality have been discovered by scientists in the biggest ever study into the genetic basis for sexual orientation.
&gt; the researchers, from north shore university health system&amp;#039;s research institute, in illinois, us, also discovered differences in the tshr gene, which is linked to the thyroid, another area which has previously been associated with sexual orientation.
&gt; &amp;quot;the goal of this study was to search for genetic underpinnings of male sexual orientation, and thus ultimately increase our knowledge of biological mechanisms underlying sexual orientation."

old joke, but it's all relative.
everything is genetic "genes linked to homosexuality discovered by scientists" oooh, the gay activists are gonna love that, they always said it was something you were born with.
“sexuality is likely influenced by many different factors, including environment, experience" reeeeeee not sure what you're implying, but it's well established that sexuality is a product of both nature and nurture.
we're just now figuring out the nature part a little better.
&gt; well established that sexuality is a product of both nature and nurture i thought that was something that gay activists strongly opposed?
i was under the impression that they have a strictly 'born this way' viewpoint - in order to oppose the religious types who say that they are making a choice (and therefore you can choose to pray away the gay!).
think of the biology (genes) as a predisposing factor.
if two people with different genes have the same experience, they will likely be affected differently by that experience (how they process it, internalize it, etc).
but regardless of how one becomes gay, once your brain is hard wired that way there's no going back.
hence there's never really a choice made, and you can't do takesie-backsies.
the only people that have a choice are those attracted to both sexes (i.e.
bisexuals).
why would they care either way?
the bible was written by men, and it doesn’t matter what you end up being attracted to.
why would they want it to be something you're born with?
then science could just eliminate the gay gene.
conversely, if it's something that you're not born with then you could presumably condition it away.
i don't like this discussion tbh.
one way or the other, trying to ascribe an origin is just looking for a way to eliminate or control it.
just let the gays be gay &gt; eliminate the gay gene why would anyone do that though?
who cares, other than the shrinking population of fundamentalist types.
when they first mapped the human genome, they thought it would save mankind.
but it's been complicated... they still don't understand why some strands are present at all.
also a tomato has a larger sequence than a human, and they don't know why.
lots of work to be done, a few centuries worth.
even with supercomputing.
fake news how come identical twins can have different sexual orientations ?
answer that or stfu identical twins don't actually have identical genes lol.
[don't lie ](https://youtu.be/p5mtclwloeq) best troll comment ever.
i thought everything was a social construct according to cultural marxists?
&gt;"traditional power markets including gas and coal have softened," the company said.
really?
because west virginians are pretty sure those mines are about to open right back up.
trump promised them so.
[deleted] here's a helpful chart showing employment in the coal mining sector in the united states from 1985 onwards: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ces1021210001 let me know if notice a trend.
only idiots, donald trump and industry shills believe coal mining is making a comeback.
donald trump doesn't believe coal mining is making a comeback.
he correctly believes that he can get votes and support by promising a comeback.
two very different things.
what the hell happened may-august 1989?
the industry dropped like 20% of its employment and picked it back up?
must be this?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pittston_coal_strike wow, that 2013-2015 drop was intense.
makes me understand a little bit why those in the industry might be pissed at obama, especially if they have been brainwashed by anti-climate propaganda.
rough.
it's due to the huge glut of ng production in the usa.
gas plants are so much cheaper to run that coal's entirely uncompetitive even if you skip the environmental regulations.
that sounds right, but as i said, that graph certainly shines a light on a dislocation that i am sure has been intense for the people that work in that industry.
too bad the current admin only wants to fix this via blowing smoke up people's ass.
but it's what you get when you elect a conman, i guess.
[deleted] &gt; nobody makes decisions based on data.
actually, most rational people do.
irrational people on the other hand respond emotionally with little forethought.
[deleted] while i understand the hatred for execs to get bonus's, its not their fault they have business savvy.
dont hate the exec's or ceos that bargained for a golden parachute before they were hired, hate the companies that granted them that perk.
ceo's dont just apply for a job, they go to schools and create a career.
they dont turn in an application, and hope for the best.
they are calculating and smart.
this is how corporations work.
dont like it?
become a ceo then.
you have that choice.
make your own opportunities.
[deleted] &gt;1) execs knew they were going to ruin the lives of these people but made commitments to manage old installations it's not a charity.
ceos and executives do not intentionally ruin companies they run.
they may be poor at their jobs, or make incorrect judgement calls, but they do not arrive at their jobs by luck.
also, enough failures on their resumes do not benefit them at all for being hired in the future.
golden parachutes are against aggressive takeovers but whatever go get an mba and 20 years experience in one of the largest international corps on earth, then come back and lecture us on how they should structure their employee payment and run their organisations.
you're opinion doesn't matter, and if you had the experience, knowledge and skillset to acquire a senior management position, you wouldn't be commenting here on reddit because you would be working 70+ hour weeks.
[deleted] you know what has no basis in reality, you believing you know better than ge.
oh no.
this one was worse.
you cannot degenerate to "i know you are, but what am i" after only one reply.
an enormous series of logical fallacies.
"your opinion doesn't matter": implying that individuals that don't have experience in a particular area are incapable of critical analysis.
commonly associated with athletes it's completely devoid of any intellectual validity.
information can be acquired without experience. "
if you had the experience, knowledge and skillset to acquire a senior management position, you wouldn't be commenting here on reddit because you would be working 70+ hour weeks.
": a truly insane thing to suggest.
lets break down the logical premise you suggest: that all human individuals on planet earth who have the ability to work in senior business management would do so.
not only that it is bundled with the suggestion that all human beings on planet earth would opt into working 70+ hours if they simply had the ability to work in senior business management (notwithstanding the individual could actually be working 70+ hour weeks and still commenting on a social media forum.)
further logical fallacies: that senior business management inherently has no downtime.
we all know that to be false considering it's a job mostly of social connections and decision making not one of provable objective knowledge/skill.
the suggestion that having an mba is a necessary component of senior business management is demonstrably false as there is no correlation between the two and quite frankly an mba is more of a way to train corporate underlings than it is a way to teach someone to innovate and create within a new market space.
additional fallacy: that anyone with the experience, knowledge, and skillset needed to 'acquire a senior management position' would even be interested in that.
yet again it makes an extreme projection of personal values that are simply untrue.
as a rudimentary example we could use something like: air traffic controller manager.
these are individuals with the intelligence, knowledge, and skillse tto manage an international business (considering that job has a demonstrably higher level of responsibility and lower margin for error) yet opt not to.
it's almost as if motivation and greed has far more to do with those in positions of business management than skill and ability.
you, sir, are completely wrong in everything you say.
an illogical nightmare person.
i don't completely agree with the comment above you, but you are just making up things as you go.
?
what does that mean?
if you believe i've used faulty logic please point it out in a constructive, comprehensive fashion.
i would be more than willing to deate the finer points of my logical consistency with you.
what have i 'made up'?
in fact all i did was analyze the statements he made for their logical validity.
when utilizing logic you analyze someone's premise (all statements of opinion have a premise, it's the very nature of attempting to convince someone of something).
you then take that premise to its' logical conclusion.
so please, challenge my assertions with effort.
don't shitpost.
show the world what i 'made up'.
just stating 'you made this up' doesn't make that true.
in fact your lack of effort suggests that you don't have a fully formed coherent idea as to what i 'made up' at all.
almost as if you responded solely to be contrarian and not to actually offer a substantial intellectual disagreement.
i would suggest if you believe anything i stated was 'made up' that you are not familiar with formal logic in even a passing sense.
it's a debate about corporate business structure.
you didn't provide any data to prove op wrong, and there's loads of them.
instead you chose rhetorical ramblings and randomly throwing words ending rhyming with "logic" and "fallacy".
show proof or gtfo.
his statements don't require any data.
they're provably wrong by basic logical extrapolation.
why would you acquire data to counter someone with zero data?
i even parsed out his words piecemeal and explained exactly what they mean.
words have meaning.
you don't need data to prove that the words people state don't mean what they claim them to mean.
simply stating 'all people that could work 70+ hours, would work 70+ hours' isn't data.
it's a statement of opinion that is completely unsubstantiated by reality.
data is required when you are making positive assertions, not counteracting others irrational statements.
i'm not here to make positive assertions about corporate business structures.
that's not a point i responded to and at no point in time did i make any statements as to how corporate business structure should be run.
i pointed out a specific individuals unsubstantiated assertions using basic, introductory logic.
there's nothing rhetorical about my statements.
rhetoric is designed to ellicit an emotional response to extract an opinion from an individual/group.
i made no such attempt.
one would suggest that you are simply confused.
i didn't just 'throw words' out there.
i explained the logical fallacies in great detail.
https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/logical_fallacy "a logical fallacy is an error in the logic of an argument [1][2] that prevents it from being logically valid but does not prevent it from swaying people's minds."
i then pointed out each of the errors in his logic.
virtually any time someone makes extreme all-encompassing statements they are committing a logical fallacy.
there are virtually no absolutes.
people use absolutes as a way to change people's emotions.
i'm going to presume this is one of your first encounters with even basic formal logic.
i'd suggest you take one of the many introduction to logic courses on coursera.
it'd really assist you in understanding what exactly is happening here.
good luck friend.
edit: and to support my one 'positive assertion' : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/air_traffic_controller which is that a manager of air traffic controllers would possess the necessary qualifications to fulfill those positions.
it should give you a rundown of exactly why i would suggest that and how obvious it is that as a 'profession' it consists of people more consistently qualified than that of 'senior business management'.
thus disproving his assertion that 'anyone that could do it, would do it'.
&gt;why would you acquire data to counter someone with zero data?
yes, otherwise that would make your claim as useless as his.
like 2 idiots arguing.
again, you haven't actually stated what was irrational about my statements.
claim implies a positive assertion.
i pointed out the one example that might be misconstrued as a positive assertion (if only because it assumed knowledge of the reader which i consider readily accessible: the high level of credentials required to function as an air traffic controller).
you only provide data for positive assertions.
and again, what am i 'claiming' anyway?
as you have yet to offer up a single deconstruction/disagreement with any of my logical analysis it's fair to say my original statements still stand as valid.
deconstructing irrational statements requires no data.
it's simply pointing out what the words people state, actually mean.
that doesn't require data.
words mean what they mean.
would you prefer i cite the dictionary for every word?
you don't really understand what you're saying.
do you have any formal academic training?
legal training?
english literature training?
have you completed high school?
again, i vehemently urge you to check out an intro to logic course online.
you'd benefit greatly from it.
lol your username!
have you ever actually read marx?
you are opinion does not matter a large portion of my extended family are engineers.
they all work oil and gas.
two of my cousins decided to setup a firm together that would specialize in wind and solar energy projects.
the money was lower but they were convinced it was the future.
they haven't been out of work.
all the while when oil dipped all of the petroleum engineers were looking for jobs.
yeah, it really does suck when people who are working in the coal industry lose their jobs.
the fact that less coal turbines are needed was the reason for these lay offs.
people need to look to the future for their careers and not the past.
i would suspect layoffs were more related to age and benefits than they were to the divisions.
fresh 30-something hires can be retrained and learn quickly.
50-somethings... not so much.
right in time for christmas.
do they celebrate christmas in the ukistan and germanyistan anymore?
oh sweet child, you watch way too much fox news.
how about in bumshaft, obrahoma where you live?
lemon better be careful... this is probably due to the bitenuker fiasco..... the article says uk and germany.
still humans chainsaw al ??!!
doesn't ge generally cut @ 10% each year and hire new folks to keep from stagnant workforce?
shedding jobs is such a nice way to say they are throwing 12000 workers out in the streets.
luckily, this should raise share prices.
it's a 5% workforce reduction, ge will hit that with normal attrition inside of a year if they don't hire replacements for the people that leave.
shedding jobs is more accurate than layoff in this case.
but they're getting a tax holiday for those offshore funds.
where's the jobs at yo?
"shed"?
you mean like exfoliated skin cells?
thanks, trump.
i think this is impacting jobs for the swiss, brits, and germans nowadays everything is trumps fault those damn trumps woo trump economy yeahhhhhhh yea might want to check the old s&amp;p500 lmao how's that carrier factory holding up, eh?
not sure but my 401k is looking great mmmmmmmm such a thoughtful chap.
the problem is that ge power equipment is garbage and nobody buys it anymore.
years ago it was very popular, but still garbage.
now it’s just unpopular garbage in the industry.
they didn’t innovate or partner for success like their competitors.
what?
what are you talking about?
ge has 40% of thw wind turbine market.
https://www.awea.org/annualmarketreport.aspx?itemnumber=6313 so?
having 40% of one market (where there’s only a couple real competitors) doesn’t really mean anything.
i’m actually in the industry.
ge power stuff (like switchgear, mccs, breakers, etc) is not good.
edit: looked at your link.
i’m most surprised mitsubishi is that far down, but i don’t do too much with wind turbines.
times have changed buddy.
ge sold that portion of the portfolio to abb.
edit: forgot to link https://technology.ihs.com/595838/abb-to-acquire-ge-industrial-solutions-strengthen-its-switchgear-market-position like a month ago...hence why they’re shedding the portions that abb didn’t want.
i'll give you credit for being right.
according to this article, abb expects significant improvements once they can focus on the division, which ge never planned on doing.
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-abb-ge-industrial-solutions/abb-buys-ge-business-for-2-6-billion-in-bet-it-can-boost-margins-iduskcn1c00dw you're saying that ge's products were so bad that a leading multinational purchased them?
also, you're only like 30. how do you know what was going on with purchasing decisions "years ago."
you're an electrical engineer who doesn't like ge's "power stuff"?
bingo.
i try to dumb things down for the average redditor.
well surprise surprise most redditors turn out to be smarter then you.
hmm?
there must be something in the dc water.
seems a lot of people don't remember stuff when asked about it.
when they asked.
him if he remembered the conversation he said "nyet" obviously, if you hang out with them so much, how would you remember that one meeting?
the most classic excuse there is.
accounts of a closed-door testimony... nice.
well, dementia *does* run strong in the male side of the trump breed.
greatest memory ever ah, the [peter gabriel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87yl5pbf-zi) defence.
i cant remember much of what i did last week but i would remember flying to fucking russia to meet with someone to talk about one specific subject.. you didn't read the article, did you?
of course not.
nobody flew to russia.
they're talking about a single meeting at trump tower.
that isn't even this article, that is just general knowledge of the ongoing scandal.
this article is about the meeting at trump tower.
don't try to make excuses because you agree with people who can't be bothered to read.
&gt;don't try to make excuses how did i make an excuse?
my point was even if you haven't read the article you should be able to figure out what it is talking about.
then i'm not understanding what you meant.
what he said happened didn't.
if you're saying his comment reflects "general knowledge" then you're saying the "general knowledge" is inaccurate.
"general knowledge" is that trump jr's infamous russia meeting refers to the one in trump tower.
he has zero qualifications for this role.
what a fucking joke.
on the contrary: when the goal is to provoke violence and use that as cause for greater us military force in the region, throwing a complete fucking nincompoop in charge of the powderkeg and lighting a few matches nearby is a *great* way to reach that.
get used to it.
you live in an aristocracy now.
plutocracy oligarchy... idiocracy... a lot of things sound much more accurate than democracy.
kleptocracy, corporatocracy.
prety much started around the 20s with kennedy rising thru prohibition god job i'm not american then ;) he married into the trump family, and therefore is part of the trump family.
he's bigly qualified!
/s the media should be kicking and screaming about israeli interference in the 2016 u.s elections instead of russian.
israel has influenced and interfered more in u.s politics than any other nation and trumps recent actions are proving that point.
it's anti-semetic to point out that israel has interfered in us elections.
unfortunately for the russians, there's not a handy label they can use to deflect any criticism directed at them.
this is the best tl;dr i could make, [original](https://www.propublica.org/article/jared-kushner-kushner-companies-donating-west-bank-settlement) reduced by 85%.
(i'm a bot) ***** &gt; as jared kushner leads the u.s. government&amp;#039;s effort to develop an israeli-palestinian peace plan, the kushner companies charitable foundation is funding a hardline israeli settlement in the west bank.
&gt; the donation to bet el came from a charitable fund &amp;quot;solely controlled&amp;quot; by charles kushner, jared&amp;#039;s father, according to kushner companies spokeswoman chris taylor.
&gt; the kushner companies donation to bet el comes at a time when jared kushner is under scrutiny for his unsuccessful effort last december to block a united nations resolution to condemn israeli settlement-building in the west bank.

| *top* *keywords*: **kushner**^#1 **bet**^#2 **president**^#3 **fund**^#4 **settlement**^#5 between this and moving the embassy i think it sounds more like they're hoping to goad the palestinians into violence.
i'm sure netanyahu would find that a convenient distraction right about now.
goad them into violence towards americans, which trump will call an act of war, so the us has an excuse to level the palestinian territories with bombs until they elect a us backed government and sign a peace agreement.
you’re giving them way too much credit.
they are just stupid.
well the current system hasn't worked, so maybe trying something new will finally bring peace to the middle east.
/s &gt; level the palestinian territories with bombs until they elect a us backed government and sign a peace agreement.
and allowing his rich buddies to profit from no-bid contracts to rebuild and administer the new territory.
i mean, we've never seen anything like it, in the last 20 years.
[do you want to read something juicy?
](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4322794/gowdy-flynn-letter.pdf) that's one way of getting a peace agreement.
the us have never even given israel *one* soldier to fight a battle.
this is sensationalist nonsense you are spewing.
yes not one soldier.... but $3 billion in aid annually even though you are moving the goalposts, and the us sends lots of money in aid to israel's enemies as well, *i appreciate you posting something truthful*.
this is all i am asking for here.
thank you.
3.3 billion.
israel is the largest total recipient of american aid overall.
not to mention this aid is a direct subsidy to the military industrial complex.
&gt; not to mention this aid is a direct subsidy to the military industrial complex.
yes, so their largest amount of aid goes to a country that actually gives them something in return.
they are allies after all.
they certainly are allies.
i simply disagree with forcing israel to purchase weapons.
if israel really needs material support we should subsidize other sectors of our economy and israel can purchase weapons as it sees fit.
that money can better stimulate our economy in other ways.
or that money can be spent in other humanitarian ways, israel is an industrialized first world country.
they dont need "aid" this is fair.
i only entered this conversation to dispute op's disingenuous sentiment based on nothing truthful or concrete.
yea we just attack their enemies directly.
&gt;yea we just attack their enemies directly.
the us have never attacked *one* palestinian or *one* palestinian territory for israel.
the us completely abstained from helping israel in their various wars against their neighbors.
who does everyone have to keep making shit up?
there is *plenty* of *real* stuff to criticize israel and the us with, yet people feel the need to discredit their own legitimacy about the issue through lies and sensationalism.
abstained from helping israel in their various wars ?
lol .. check out nickel grass operation.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_nickel_grass?wprov=sfti1 my phrasing was off, but my point was that there have never been soldiers or us controlled fighters *ever* fighting on behalf of israel.
supply delivery is very different from this.
op insinuated the us and trump's plan would be to *directly* attack palestinians, which i hope you would agree is nonsense if you reread same.
op didn't insinuate anything.
he just posted an article.
if anything, it's yourself who's doing the insinuating.
"op" refers to "original poster", it does not always mean the person who posted the content.
the person i referred to posted the following, which is obnoxious bullshit, yet i get hit with -30 for simply stating *facts*: &gt;goad them into violence towards americans, which trump will call an act of war, so the us has an excuse to level the palestinian territories with bombs until they elect a us backed government and sign a peace agreement.
anyway, i am over it.
this thread is hilariously ignorant cancer.
no.
just syria, iraq, libya, and now everyone wants us to attack iran too.
&gt; just syria, iraq, libya, and now everyone wants us to attack iran too.
these countries were never attacked by the us on behalf of israel or during any of israel's wars.
try again.
lol k. &gt;lol k. good answer.
thnks bby are you seriously that naive?
do you seriously think that all the wars the us is having and has had with the million other middle eastern countries has absolutely nothing to do with israel and shared political goals with them?
currently, the us, israel, and saudi arabia are destabilizing the middle eastern region like never before.
the us along with these other scumback nations are completely responsible for this mess that we're in.
the us doesn't have to attack palestine directly, they can do it indirectly through destabilising the region and the peace process, which basically ends up having the same effect as if they attacked directly - a rise of insurgents and an increase in hatred to the us.
it has nothing to do with naivety, but i appreciate the name calling.
the op stated, “so the us has an excuse to level the palestinian territories with bombs”.
this is unequivocally sensationalist nonsense.
like i said, “us have never even given israel one soldier to fight a battle”.
they have not ever “attacked one palestinian or one palestinian territory for israel”.
these are **facts**.
if you want to get into geopolitics, that is your prerogative, but i am simply contesting *blatant lies*.
us citizens go over there to serve in their national guard all the time.
what the fuck are you talking about?
&gt; citizens what is your argument here?
that citizens aren't a part of the us now?
besides, one could easily argue our foray into iraq was at least partially done with israel's blessing, again sending our troops to fight their conflicts.
&gt; what is your argument here?
&gt;&gt;**the us have never even given** israel one soldier to fight a battle.
the united states is a country.
that country has never given *one* american soldier to israel to fight a battle.
citizens going to serve another country on their *own accord* is not the same as their government deploying them there.
i could not have been more clear in this regard.
but they did.
citizens join their national guard and became soldiers.
so your statement is a falsehood.
you're just splitting hairs anyway, the us gives them billions in aid a year, that buys a lot of mercenaries and foot soldiers when they need them.
lets not forget to mention the guns and bombs we give them.
saves them plenty of cash they can then use to buy more mercs.
[deleted] if the end game is the exact same wouldnt one at least prevent millions of deaths?
wouldn't quite gain billions in munitions sales though... [deleted] life has really got to suck when you have to tuck and run from *every* question.
sorry for you.
to answer yours.
no i am not.
trying very hard here, but once again, the whole false equivalency is getting old.
hilary's bad plans are infinitely better than trumps best ones.
it's also utterly irrelivent.
he might as well be complaining that his plans are better than nixons plans for israel or reagan's.
who gives a flying f what hillary dis or was planning to do.
the issue is what current us policy is.
precisely.
on a scale of 1 to 10, election rigging is probably a 2 or a 3. i mean its fucked, but the situation is pretty fucked and at least the intention is to deal with it in a nonviolent fashion.
goading palestinians into violence is probably a holy fuck i don't have a number low enough for that.
... because there wasn't a civil war between hamas and fatah after the last election in gaza?
rigging the election would also lead to violence.
and levelling the fucking place wont?
tin foil geopolitics.
more precisely, it's one of the possible, and acceptable, outcomes that they foresee.
they will continue to abuse palestinians for personal gain, with the following possible responses: if palestinians do nothing - "see, they're fine with it!"
if palestinians protest peacefully - [pretend not to notice] if palestinians respond violently - "they're barbaric savages incapable of reason!"
palestinian kid throws a rock over the fence- "act of war act of war!!!!!!
muslims are violent towards us!"
_fires 5 tomahawk missiles into civilian area_ &gt; fires 5 profit missiles into civilian area amended for maximum clarity.
what seems more likely, is that trump has little control over his administration; everyone is pursuing their own crooked agenda.
jared's hobby is zionism, so why not try to "negotiate" peace?
surely having an israelis and americans who share the same ideas about israel as a jewish state sit down with the palestinians is all it takes to make peace happen.. to their credit, the palestinians are at least refraining from saying out loud that they see him as simply an israeli wearing a american flag pin.
jared may be totally unqualified, and everyone can see that he is totally out of his depth, but at least they're being polite.
as for this embassy move, it's like trump got a call from jared saying "hey dad, i found something you can do that congress will support 100% and doesn't require any approval" and that was all trump needed to hear.. also, it feeds the base, and makes good on campaign promises, so never mind the fallout, let's spin the wheel and see what happens... and - worst comes to worst - there is a nuclear war in the middle east, and the 'problem' solves itself, and the second coming of christ is ushered in, to the applause of his core supporters.
the endlösung of the palestinian question?
they're not hoping for anything other than to appease the israelis for the fuck up trump made by revealing intel to the russians.
you make it sound like this was planned, like this was a scheme.
this is desperate scrabbling to maintain relations with the israelis, that some people have hijacked in order to ruin relationships with the palestinians.
someone is trying to make me hurt someone by saying stuff i don’t like.
- man with no agency no need to goad them into violence.
they have plenty of missile they send almost daily.
do you know when hamas last fired a rocket at israel?
yea didn't israel bomb a school as a response?
edit: wasn't it a rather long time?
10 years?
you don't think that this might increase the violence?
you don't think that they will fire the missile regardless?
they had multiple chances for peace, starting with camp david, and they still chose violence.
i think the amount of violence will continue regardless of the moving of an embassy.
hezbollah only wants one thing, the destruction of israel and all the people in it.
you can go to their own website to read their doctrine.
i guess what i'm getting at is that it isn't some black or white violence or no violence state.
the level of violence has fluctuated over time because of factors not entirely unlike what my original comment mentioned.
while i do not suggest that israelis simply do whatever their enemies demand i do think that actions should be carefully considered as to the benefits and consequences that they might bring.
what exactly do the contested settlements and moving the embassy do for israelis?
and does that outweigh a surge in violence from palestinians?
are you thinking of hamas?
hezbollah are from lebanon.
were that to be true, why do you think they do that, when they have a key player in "peace" talks actively undermining any progress to helping the palestinian side.. why the *fuck* is jared kushner holding any office, with any authority whatsoever?
i've seen people with more integrity and sense of duty manage a taco bell.
kuz he fucks the presidents daughter.
is that the same reason why donald trump has a position of power?
he also fucks the president's daughter.
nah, he's fucking america.
but it's consensual.
porque no los dos!?
shit, trump should be able to fully staff his cabinet with that because he was squeezed out of the right cooch.
that's all that matters anymore.
squeezed out of the right one and squeezed into the right one something tells me there's not much squeezing going on with ivanka's slash.
true, it's been used by the whole family.
i bet her father sold her to other rich people so they could molest her.
after he was done, most likely.
poor girl.
born into molestation because of rich people.
ftfy: i've seen people with more integrity and sense of duty ~~manage a taco bell~~ *sweeping streets and cleaning toilets*.
hey, janitors are amazing and hard working, don't insult then like that we should make prisoners become janitors to validate the scorn they receive so is this the shit on people's jobs thread?
i don't shit on peoples job.
read it again: kushner is *below* the sweepers and cleaners.
way below.
because sweepers and cleaners do an honest job.
may want to check how you phrase what you said.
it makes it look like you're saying "these people are super low and shitty, but this guy is even shittier than them".
if i wanted to use super lowlife jobs, i would have used "lawyers" and "used car dealers".
that's... that's not... nevermind.
when making a comparison like you were trying to, you don't give an example of something you deem high quality and then say something is underneath it.
if you do that, it comes off the way i explained.
my dad's a lawyer, he's helped sooo many people and worked so hard to get that education and opportunity... you sound like a 12 year old maybe he's the exception.
but there is a reason for sayings like "crooked like a lawyer".
yeah but i've also seen many people holding office with equal or less integrity as well.
being in office doesn't make you a good person.
of course not, but demanding better from those in office *consistently* is sometimes all that is asked from the average citizen when they are not voting.
no one expects saints, that doesnt mean we can't demand accountability.
remind me which "office" he holds again.
jerus-a-lago.
is it a controversial west bank settlement that won't have an extradition treaty with the us?
probably.
kush needs somewhere to lay low for a couple decades.
he has a reserved place to stay already, free food and housing.
trump tower?
jerusalem does seem kushy.
&gt; kush needs somewhere to lay low for a couple decades.
like a ... cemetery?
heh i hear leavenworth has some terrific out-of-the-way places for hiding.
he can’t.
he’s in debt up to his eyeballs and needs cash fast.
that’s why he’s selling off his position in government.
we have an awkwardly tall and gawky semitic man hiding out somewhere in the middle east from crimes against the us?
no problem, call in seal team 6. bibi is asking around to see if they can make it part of panama so he can move there too how is he "working on a peace deal"?
has he done anything at all besides talking about how he is working on it?
i can talk all day about how i'm working on opening a bakery, but that doesn't mean that i actually am.
i'm working on getting high.
just 4 more hours to go.
honestly, the optics of having the president's jewish son-in-law negotiate peace between palestinians and jews was bad enough... this is just icing on the cake and the relocation of the us embassy are sprinkles on top.
make no mistake, there will never be peace between two groups who have declared that their god has given them a plot of land but this will certainly turn up the heat in the entire region.
can anyone say what kushner's job title even is?
behind every deal, another money-making scheme.
judging by the list of shit he has been given to do, calling his job title ["the entire white house'](http://www.businessinsider.com/what-does-jared-kushner-do-in-trump-administration-2017-4) is the only thing that makes any sense trump declares jerusalem the capital of israel, palestine riots, israel imposes full martial law.
single state solution imposed and that west bank charity property portfolio (among others) is going to sky rocket in price...follow the money.
"peace deal" kinda like north korea w. bush also deliberately screwed the mid east peace process.
all this is just in hopes of provoking a reaction to generate distracting headlines the warmonger sharon was pm then.
the warmonger bibi is pm now and profits for the rich people whose corporations build bombs and missiles and other sundry military items.
that's the us in a nutshell during this whole conflict.
say you want a peace deal, but tilt the scale towards one side behind the scenes.
conflict of interest much?
"whilst jared kushner is working on a peace deal between israelis and the palestinians" are you on crack??
and kushner could be paid to basically do whatever israel wants him to do.
this guy went there with a giant sign that read "buy me".
and so they did.
enough to keep 666 5th avenue solvent yet?
jared might need to do a bit more "peace talks".
this is totally a conflict of interest, but tbf, you could make the argument that it is one that might encourage him to do his job *better*, since a peace deal would be beneficial to the project he's funding.
ah, who i am kidding?
he's still a scumbag what is better to that kind of “project” is hardly good for peace, let alone the occupied population.
there's barely been any progress in the peace progress in years, steps forward have not worked, maybe it is time for a step back.
that rather looks like a jump into a precipice.
what else should we do, keep the status quo forever, where one nation is being struck by terrorists on a weekly basis, and a people supressed due to the views of their leaders, or should we shake things up in the hope they get better?
doing the bidding of the most fanatical ultra-nationalists is not jus “shaking things up”.
it’s rather setting them afire.
nothing good can come from it.
what have the other options offered us?
every peace offer put forward so far has been rejected by the palestinian governments, it is time to show that time is running out and we're sick of this shit.
hold up.
without taking sides here, how can you claim that palestine was the one rejecting peace when israel have on several occasions revoked or violated prior agreements.
besides, literally everyone from the us jd to the israeli legal counsel agrees that the settlements are illegal.
its like your neighbour is claiming part of your backyard belongs to him.
while you two are in court or something, he keeps building sheds and fences on the land he claims.
eventually he argues he should get at least part of the land since his shed and fence are already on it.
if i actively try to kill my neighbour using bombs and knife attacks you'd have a point, but i am not doing that.
no one is saying palestine doesn't have to get their shit together, but in what universe does building more illegal settlements do *anything* except exacerbate the situation?
try offering what the entire international community has been demanding and all arabs states supported back in 2002: full israeli withdrawal to the 1967 lines (with minor land swaps) and a just solution to the refugee plight.
how about offering something that doesn't mean surrendering while you are the victor?
it may sound stupid, but if you've defended your nation multiple times from attack, you should have the right to dictate the peace terms.
germany didn't get to dictate peace terms in 1918, germany didn't get to dictate peace terms in 1945, and now, in 2017, the loser should not get to dictate the peace terms.
if you are stuck in a victory/surrender mentality, don’t be surprised when the other side refuses your “generous” offers.
modern conflicts require that justice is served and international law respected.
the international consensus on this conflict precisely offers this, which is why it would be accepted.
&gt; how about offering something that doesn't mean surrendering while you are the victor?
since when is complying with international law surrendering?
very balanced of you to look at the harm done to both sides, and then blame the palestinians in both situations.
&gt; or should we shake things up in the hope they get better?
yes, inciting war is the best way to get peace.
if anything it would allow israel to force a peace, since the peaceful way hasn't worked over the past 20 years.
with 99% decrease in terror infiltrations because of the security fence, there seems to be a greater interest in trying to find alternative ways to pursue peace.
the embassy move it one of them.
the decrease is rather due to security collaboration between occupation and pa forces.
don’t expect a piece of concrete to be of much use once palestinians refuse to cooperate in their own repression for no good reason.
&gt; decrease is rather due to security collaboration between occupation and pa forces no.
the pa is not standing on the green line next to the security fence preventing palestinians from infiltrating.
this doesn't happen.
if there is a peace deal his settlement project will likely be demolished.
that like proposing to a girl while raping her sister.
they’ll probably suspect his motives, since he’s a jew n all.
"working" hes not doing shit.
kushy, baby, keep doing you!
don't let the h8erz ruin your thirst for chaos.
#parchedforchaos i hope the palestinians don't find out he is two faced and back out of negotiations, because he is probably the one person in the world with the skills to resolve this dispute.
kushner is flatly siding with israel and openly supporting their settlements.
there is no fucking way he can mediate this.
this monster is not working for anything which does not improve himself.
he is the devil and the antichrist.
we should airlift him from his brown-stained undies, by helicopter, to the deepest depths of the atlantic and or pacific--- whichever will have him... and leave him to die there... never to be seen and or heard of again.
one can imagine what kind of “deal” someone who supports the most radical ultra-nationalist fanatics can broker: a raw one.
this is getting mighty plot thickens-y not really, every possible fucked up, crooked, corrupt and shady thing you think these people could be doing.....they’re doing.
it’s like a shitty cop tv show, you know the plot, it’s just a matter of sitting through the details.
i hate that about cop shows, you know who the suspect is and you're like, "just arrest him already!"
*sexual tension, ridiculous subplot, enhancements, forensics, misleading suspects* "turns out it was this guy the whole time."
"the fuck have i been saying for the last hour?!"
that was the perfect metaphor for the political climate of 2017. i'd give you both gold if i had it.
the conclusion will be satisfying though.
which conclusion is that?
do you, though?
who do you blame for this?
also acknowledging jerusalem as the capital doesn't help much.
did kushner advise on this as well?
or does his father in law just like to fuck up his projects?
when i said on /r/news yesterday that i was an "antisemite" because i saw that jewish interests were different from gentile interests and often went againsts the interests of the societies that host jews, i was banned for it.
now the president of the united states has been talked into doing the bidding of the jewish state by his jewish son-in-law who's supposed to work for america.
that is why i am an "antisemite" - it's hardly the first time this happened.
it happens, to a lesser or greater extent, a thousand times a day in every american and european country.
maybe because antisemite means racist.
if you're dumb enough to say you're a racist, even if it's not true, yeah you're going to get banned.
people still believe this lie that the israeli government wants peace?
kushner is just doing his government's bidding, attempting to create more terrorism so that the israelis can kill more people and steal more land.
everything coming out of the whitehouse is smoke and mirrors.
they don't give a fuck about peace, its just another talking point to strum those heartstrings on the idiots that vote for them.
they (almost everybody in dc) actively profit off of conflict because they are invested in arms manufacturing.
any motions towards a peace agreement are just stagecraft while they destabiilize the refion even more.
perpetual war equals perpetual profit.
who pays for it?
not them, they just slashed thier taxes so now the poor and "middle class"(less poor) not only fight and die(or come home broken in mind and body), are now footing the bill for this perpetual state of war.
america is a threat to world peace every bit as much as russia.
nailed it.
fucking terrorists.
three million people live in the west bank.
do you think that all three million of them are terrorists?
i know palestine has those terrorist organizations in them, but come on, that is quite the generalization to make.
every single 'settler' in israel is a terrorist squatting on stolen land.
wait he still has the foundation running?
wow.
i had just assumed he had closed it because it is absolutely dumb to keep it running given his supposed task.
&gt; it is absolutely dumb to keep it running given his supposed task.
you have to keep in mind how utterly corrupt and shameless these people are.
zog is real get this man out!
i respect the fact that he can focus on this subject while being investigated there's an error in the headline.
it says that kushner is working on a peace deal, when this administration is working against not just a peace deal, but against even halting the violence between the sides.
jared isn't qualified for this , this will certainly go nowhere is there actually any evidence he’s working on a peace deal?
i know trump said he would be but is there any reason to think he is?
settlements are a necessary evil given israeli's current politics.
a (simplified) historical primer: modern israel had been leftist/socialist for the first 6 six decades of its existence.
thanks to the intifadas, rocket launches and cafe bombs following yitzhak rabin/olmert/sharon's attempts to make peace... israelis now find leftists who promise peace by just giving into arabs to be gullible useful idiots who don't realize there really isn't a peace partner (and they're not wrong, but that's another topic).
the result of the late 90s/early 00's is a large majority of the israeli population moved from left to center, and those in the center to the right as a reaction to an absolute disaster of a peace process that instead of creating peace, installed two former terrorist groups now as the legitimate governments of gaza and the west bank.
people today don't realize how bad things were before israel took steps like installing checkpoints and the separation barrier.
meanwhile the religious populace in israel has continued to grow, now making up 15-20%+ of the populace.
which includes a lot of religious zionists who feel jews should be able to live in biblical judea and samaria (the west bank).
and meanwhile the israeli-arab parties that make up 20% of the populace, refuse to cooperate even with the pro-peace left because... jews.
so, what you have is consistent coalitions of center, center-right and far-right religious parties with a now miniscule left-wing with arab parties that is unwilling to work with it.
and these coalitions have far-right groups that demand things like irresponsible settlements and religious concessions.
things that coalitions have to provide if they want their coalitions to remain.
having explained the whys.... netanyahu has a point and it's incredibly fair: 20% of arabs remained in israel from the 1948 war.
israel is offering/will offer people in golan heighs and jerusalem citizenships upon a final status solution.
all are given citizenship.
for context: arabs were not as gracious as jews and removed 100% of jews from the west bank.
but he's right: there is no reason why in a final status peace that jews can't live as citizens in a palestinian state.
all of the reasonable settlements near the green line can be negotiated with land swaps, but those anywhere that doesn't get swapped, just become citizens of palestine or move back to israel.
there's no reason why settlements have to be an obstacle to peace.
how can anyone think kushner is a decent guy?
even if you support israel and conservatives to the extreme, having a charitable foundation in your name that does not do charity work is the most sketchy thing i can think of.
peace through the eradication of palestine ... it's good to be king, kerching!
kushner's peace deal has about as much substance as david davis' sectoral analyses.
hm, how about the clinton foundation stealing the charity money for dying children in haiti ?
but what about when lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus during the civil war?
oh wait, that's unrelated too.
find a credible article and submit it, then you can talk about it in that thread.
oh man that is too easy.
but keep on defending those criminals and rapists... good luck!

hm, how about jared kushner company funding israeli settelements in west bank?
no way this is new.
it's silly to think the us hasn't had wikileaks under a microscope for years before 2016. yeah, shit "news" really interested to see the results of the this.
i'd bet dollars to donuts we will find substantial ties to russian intelligence agencies.
we’ll find whatever the cia wants us to find.
brainwashed baby do you really believe any investigative report will be honest?
you're hoping for results that will come from people who deceive and manipulate for a living.
*the senate intelligence committee is investigating who gave wikileaks the hacked democratic national committee data that wikileaks published in july 2016* wait a sec, i thought all 170 usa intelligence agencies established with certainty that it was the work of russian intelligence agencies, and only someone fooled by the russian propaganda can doubt this solid fact.
what are they investigating, then?
there aren't 170 intelligence agencies in america.
and yes, the intelligence community agrees that russia meddled with the election.
they're just nailing down the details.
it'd be like finding a dead russian spy in the middle of an american embassy.
and nobody's sure how he got in.
all the doors and windows will be checked.
&gt;and yes, the intelligence community agrees that russia meddled with the election.
strange, i thought that "the senate intelligence committee is investigating **who** gave wikileaks the hacked democratic national committee data that wikileaks published in july 2016".
now you're telling me they know it was the russian intelligence, but they are still investigating who did it.
how peculiar.
it is well established and verified who hacked the dnc.
this investigation is about the channels through which the hacked info got from the hackers to wikileaks and which role wikileaks itself played in that process.
different thing.
&gt;it is well established and verified who hacked the dnc.
only a private company hired by the democrats examined the allegedly hacked server.
the january report alleging tye russian involvement cites as a proof an old version of malware sold on the web by a ukrainian hacker.
of the three agencies who signed the january report, the nsa had the lowest confidence in its conclusions.
the timestamps on the files copied from the dnc server are more consistent with local copying to an usb drive than with copying over the network.
all of the above **is** "well established and verified ".
as to who "hacked the dnc", the so-called "intelligence community" says that they are pretty sure, but can't show the actual evidence, because it's all classified.
&gt; this investigation is about the channels through which the hacked info got from the hackers to wikileaks the wikileaks has cryptographically secure dropbox that anyone can use to transfer information to them anonymously.
is that what they are investigating?
then they could just read the wikipedia, or even visit wikileaks site to see for themselves.
makes sense to me.
few things don't, if one watches enough usa television.
anywhere i can read more about this?
how old was little foot when he died?
did they get a rough idea of what his life may have been like?
i hope he lived a good fulfilling life in the great valley.
just as his mother wanted.
it's weird how rarely they find skeleton archers.
if games have taught me anything, at least half of all skeletons are archers.
where are all the torches that last 100's and 1000's of years in sealed tombs as well.
they are keeping them for themselves probably.
selfish dogs.

we all know the concept of evolution but it's still fascinating to see the picture of the skeleton with the body of a humanoid but the skull that's closer to an ape than homo sapiens.
i don't know why i was expecting some giant skeleton, i need to lay off the movies people were shorter back then hobbits are people.
i know but i've seen too many weird movies twenty years to announce this?
typical, lazy academics.

it's a matter of what we were trying to do at the time.

(i'm a bot) ***** &gt; steve verheul, canada&amp;#039;s lead nafta negotiator, appeared before the standing committee on international trade earlier this week to provide an update on the negotiations.
&gt; as i wrote last month, there is a need to address net neutrality in nafta since the u.s. decision to roll back protections could have a negative impact on canadian businesses operating in the u.s. the nafta digital trade chapter is the ideal place for a net neutrality provision, though the rule should be stronger than the lightweight provision that was included in the tpp.
this issue garnered particular attention during my appearance this week on net neutrality before the ethi committee with mps expressing interest about the likelihood of success.
&gt; while canada is seeking nafta net neutrality protections, the u.s. is focused on establishing safe harbour protections for internet intermediaries.

senators.
isnt hezbollah an iranian proxy?
yes absolutely so.
according to the us then yes.
on the ground it would seem they work very close with the iranians, although the link may be more like the uk and us instead of direct proxy forces.
so i'd consider not fully proxy, but they share a massive amount of the same ideology, motivations, and objectives.
ordering more death and destruction you mean.
its a natural response to israel's actions.
israel didn't do anything.
years of killing palestinians and taking away their land is "didn't do anything"?
that justification can be used for any and all violent acts by palestinians.
also for worldwide terrorism.
"isis cut of heads of women and children?
whatabout years of killing iraqi sunnis and taking away their lands by kurds and shites?"
so you jave yourself a great justification to dismiss all acts by one side because the other side has been bad.
what did israel do yesterday that deserves this response?
after years of oppression they'll undoubtedly fight back.
look at what israel has been doing for years not whether or not they did anything yesterday.
trump's announcement was just a trigger.
it's not a response to israel's actions... so this is not a response to israel stealing palestine's land, demolishing their homes, and killing their people?
no, it's a response to the us recognizing jerusalem as the capital of israel, have you been paying any attention?
and did you read the article?
had israel not committed all those transgressions none of this would've happened.
there are an enormous amount of factors that led to the current situation, and only some of them were by israel.
"they started it!"
is a stupid argument when either side uses it because there are no clean hands in the conflict.
when hezbollah says "we are doing this because of america", they are doing it because of america.
and had not arabs and palestinians engaged in the anti-israel wars of the late 60s - early 70s, then we wouldn't have these problems either.
violent and stupid ain’t a way to go through life son.
hassan nasrallah feels the needs to be vindicated of any wrongdoing, no matter how much he has destroyed the sovereignty of his own country.
haniyeh too.
both are putting justification to everything they've been preaching by getting their stooges to do their dirty work.
hezbollah, fuck off.
you're not palestinian.
you're not even arab.
fuck off.
they're not arab?
lol what the fuck are you smoking.
they are persian they look arab, they sound arab, they come from an arab country, so what are they if not arab?
and so what if they're not arab?
are you only allowed to care about your own ethnicity?
well, that was predictable.
he's cheering from the sidelines.
more like the reserve bench.
yes, go send other people to their deaths to further your aims of seeing israel inconvenienced.
itt: people laughing at the "savages" who are inherently violent.
not like their side, they are squeaky clean.
you know the side that has bombed libya, lebanon, syria, iraq, iran, yemen, somalia, sudan, pakistan, afghanistan, cambodia, vietnam, grenada, guatamala, el salvador, nicaragua, panama, and the former yugoslavia.
you know the side that has overthrown countless governments that didn't fit their agenda.
you know the side that has murdered thousands of civilians that they call "collateral damage".
the civilized side.
to be fair, nonviolent people who have no power to bomb or not bomb are laughing at the "savages" who can and do bomb one another.
i can't stop the us govt from drone striking somalia.
but 20yr old palestinians can stop exploding israeli border guards.
just hope hezbollah doesnt get directly involved, seems like the whole thing is a trap set for them.
yep
isnt that one of the angels off evangelion?
didn't expect to see this here.
take it and go.
familiar with the show.
i still don't get it.
edit: "micuhael" missed that goddamn it.
i am so sick of reading about trump but can't help myself.
must... click... one... more... shitty... link... that’s how he wins you have to read this one.
they found some random person they could quote saying that michael flynn must have secret text messages that show this, totally credible information!
every few days newsweek has the smoking gun and each week we are all disappointed.
not that anyone considers newsweek a credible news organization anymore i don't try do disparage news outlets anymore.
i feel like i've been participating in this noisy incoherent news world long enough to apply critical thinking and follow up on a newsworthy sentiment using multiple sources.
unfortunately many people don’t practice the same qualities as you and simply read the headline.
so for them we must try to breed a sub of better quality sources.
i like this idea, but i think in addition to that, a sub that breeds critical thinking skills would be way more effective.
a sub doesn't control the input, they only control the output.
there is a process: 1.
)you read headlines and get your news.
you read about a broad spectrum of different topics to stay as informed about as many types of diverse issues in the world as possible.
you feel wholistically informed about a variety of news events and appreciate the diverse perspective each different topic offers you.
2) you are approached about your position on one issue in particular.
the facts you present in your arguments are denounced as somewhat old, misinformed,skewed or just not 100% perfect for whatever reason.
you are told to "learn to read more than just the headlines."
3) you re-approach your method to getting news.
you read about fewer topics this time, but with much more in-depth analysis about the actual issues.
you feel less informed about having a wholistic perspective on events, but feel more confident about your knowledge about the select topics you know.
4) you are approached about your position on one issue in particular.
the facts you present are precise with much more research and evidence to back it up.
you present specifics cases in point and feel like you've represented a well researched argument.
your arguments are denounced as direct misrepresentations, or factual biased falsehoods because your source is known to have be dis-ingenuous.
5) you re-approach your method of getting news again.
you read about one or two topics this time, maintaining your in-depth analysis but this time include a deep look into each of your sources history.
you approach each source skeptically, closely regarding their history, biases and political affiliations as important considerations to extrapolate their intent.
you hope that you can most accurately support your sources of arguments with those sources that are credibly known to represent your interests historically.
6) you are approached about your position on one of the two issues in particular.
your argument is denounced without just cause.
the only explanation you are offered is that they believe you simply have a difference of opinion.
we live in a digital age of anti-intellectualism.
where the availability of information is so ubiquitous, it is assumed this process of finding the correct information has been simplified and therefore should also be ubiquitous.
*trust is currency.
* we are absolutely bankrupt in our bank of trust.
we will not retain a high standard of intellectualism by being absolutely bankrupt in trust.
tldr.
needs to be about 1/5 this size to be effective in this forum.
you basically said...news media can't really be trusted.
trump has been saying that all along actually.
nah my tldr; the liberal arts study and broad thinker is dying because of business politics + trump era.
trust is measured in dollars not people.
liberal arts thinker missed the lesson where it was conveyed that truly understanding something means you can explain it simply and with few words.
he isn't dead...just irrelevant in new media.
good riddance.
both lie, trust neither.
which is the goal of all the misinformation try harder not stop trying been a skeptic long before the misinformation campaign doesn’t a skeptic always search for the best possible form of truth?
seems more like a contrarian to simply dismiss the lot as false.
we just need to sprinkle some porn onto news outlets, so people have an incentive to look past the headlines.
unfortunately, that naked news site never really quite took off as much as i'd hoped.
/r/neutralpolitics.
any time a big story breaks, i head over there for a sourced breakdown on background and possible impact.
stumbled on this the other day.
it's a website that tells you the bias of various media organisations.
newsweek is listed as: "left-center bias".
https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center/ i'm not sure how much i like knowyourmeme as a news organization and then you spend hours of time going down a rabbit hole reading about stories that aren't well-known or picked up as big news.
i just stick by organizations like reuters now for most of my news, it's very rare that their pieces have any kind of spin on them they're usually just factual with no editorializing.
reuters is one of my favorite outlets.
flynn sent a message that was basically in line with trump's public policy opposing the sanctions.
yes this is totally in keeping with trump's public policy of using the white house to enrich himself and those surrounding him, but i can see how some would take exception to that.
i missed the part that said trump was involved in the energy project that flynn was working on.
where was that again?
was that michael flynn or micuhael flynn?
well this article was at the top of r/politics last night and they were fully convinced that this was impeachment material.
as per just about every headline that is ever there but then fades away into obscurity as it becomes clear that it's sensationalism and not based in reality.
newsweek is a shell of what it used to be.
it was sold for $1 back in 2010, and is an online only publication run by the international business times media now.
it basically lives on because of its name.
yes.
this was particularly egregious.
newsweek is a tabloid now.
every news agency does that because they know it'll bring them a bunch of clicks if they word the title to sound like they have the smoking gun.
remember rachel maddow's shitshow with the tax returns that ended up making trump look better?
they're going to ramp the russian scare up big time when the medicare and social security cuts start rolling in.
distract em!
they're just trying to gaslight everyone into thinking that trump *must* be a criminal, even if nothing has been proved that's not gaslighting.
trump *is* a criminal.
well he's a real piece of shit one way or the other oh right that’s why they can’t prosecute or prove anything surely this is he end of drumpf you really are clueless, aren't you?
is breitbart one?
hell no.
they are even worse than newsweek "experts" top men top.
men.
power top men the best men.
who is micuhael?
the angel of the nothingburger no they don't these pop up as often as the cure for cancer posts on here fuk your sensationalism *fingers in ears* lalalalalalalalala "micuhael flynn" [sic]...really?
have you just stopped trying with this nonsense op?
all hail micuhael, destroyer of worlds!
bow before your sultan!
a typo?
off with his head!
a turd from the_dolan talks about non-sense!
what a world!
yeah, his pet name is misha (general misha if you want to be more formal) not micuhael.
yeah, for a moment i thought trump was typing this title.
god bless the united shates.
[removed] mikhail carlovich (michael, son of charles) why do they always bring up hillary?
the left will be the first to tell you she is corrupt as hell and yet they all voted for her well, she wasn’t trump.
the primary was rigged my the dnc s no, she shafted the bern.
you're confusing the left with democrats.
also, socialists aren't communists.
i know you like it all simple n shit, bub, but it doesn't work that way.
socialists are communists in practice, maybe not in theory.
sorry i just watched the last 16 years play out bub, socialists are communists.
the radical socialists continue pushing left once they take power, because it is the only mechanism for maintaining power in a society dictated by false narratives and social elites.
simply look at what is happening in modern "sociology", where it gets more and more "feminist" and "intersectional" and retarded every single day.
they are just warping the ideology so that they can appear to be the creators of it, in order to appease their followers.
it will continue warping into absurdity because none of these people know a thing about anything, they are professional purveyors of bullshit.
socialism always leads to communism.
the only exception you could make to this rule is in a society with unlimited fusion energy, and even then it is likely that some kind of corrupt social elite will take over.
but i appreciate you admitting in a roundabout way that all of you left on the left are secret communists.
we know, it's why we hate you.
if a corrupt elite takes over, then it’s not communism, the word is the clue that it’s a form of communal governance, not a hierarchical system, this is the primary contradiction to the ussr be communist, just like china.
at what point did hillary clinton change from a lying bitch into a dead horse?
whenever trump brings her up it comes off as extremely pathetic.
he sounds like a whiny child.
if his base buys into this, they must really be ignorant, stupid turds.
(he talks about her, again, in the video in the article.)
&gt; at what point did hillary clinton change from a lying bitch into a dead horse?
when the election results were announced.
hatred of hillary has been cultivated by faux news for a long time.
it's an investment in propaganda, and it's effectiveness is a testament to ignorance and stupidity.
can you imagine if dems had suddenly started whining about mitt romeny after obama beat him?
it would be insane, republicans would think liberals had gone nuts, complaining about a guy who lost and has no power.
but they do it to hillary, and jimmy kimmel can go to the streets to ask people if hillary should resign and people will say yes without any clue.
his base doesn't just buy into the hatred, they automatically do mental gymnastics to pretend like she still has a government position, just so they can justify their whining.
that's not what happened.
it would be as if dems whined about romney before, during and then after obama beat him.
it's not something that just started, it's just something that never stopped.
can you clarify?
im not sure what you are referring to, since my hypothetical is something that didnt happen.
yea for sure.
your metaphor (simile?)
implies they started whining after the election was over.
mine is just pointing out that it's not that it just started, just that it never stopped.
.... people have disliked the clintons for way longer.
they would still complain about her regardless if she even ran or not.
it isn't even just repubs who dislike them either, elizabeth warren did that interview a while ago talking about her and she's still talking about how the dnc candidacy was rigged in hillary's favor.
this thread fucking stinks of borscht i know.
i have seen multiple people i disagree with in this thread, and i know for a fact that everyone i disagree with is a russia bot.
"experts say" okay cool, how about the massive investigation, have they found and confirmed this evidence?
we should be expecting charges any day right?....
well i mean... the evidence is authenticated if that is what you mean - because flynn flipped and turned state's evidence after taking a felony plea deal.
not how that works.
not sure anyone knows how our justice system works at the moment.
people being granted immunity when clearly crimes have been committed, language being changed in summary's as to not implicate crime but just, incompetence.. massive bias within an investigation against the person they are investigating.
what the fuck is going on.... i'm just saying they don't instantly indict once they have good evidence.
they are extremely thorough and will gather all the possible evidence they can before bringing the case to trial.
just because trump hasn't been charged yet doesn't mean they have no evidence.
it took nixon two years and they literally had tapes on him.
finally!
it's the smoking gun we've all been waiting for.
can't wait for the impeachment motion to be made in congress tomorrow.....oh wait, this whole thing is bullshit and nothing will come of it notice the actions were after the election.
how can actions taken after the election be considered collusion meant to affect the election?
doesn't make sense.
actions taken by flynn after the election aren't collusion, it's work.
he was literally hired by trump to mediate work between the white house and the russians.
the problem is if he started 'working' before trump was elected which would imply much more negative things.
this is why the abc report that got brian ross suspended and banned from further reporting on trump was so ridiculous.
actions by flynn after the election, but before the inauguration, are still illegal.
we don't have two presidents at a time, including presidential staff.
possibly yes, but that hasn't been decided in court of law and there is traditionally a transition period after a presidential election where the incoming president and staff start making policy reach outs.
look at this way... one president, the current, has enough evidence of russian meddling to enact legitimate international sanctions and the dude who's won, prior to even stepping foot in the office, is winking and nodding through back channels that they've lied about to not worry about said sanctions.
remove any party affiliations or names, and you get something that reeks to high heaven and if not illegal, is immoral and unethical.
this is a snowballing argument that i saw start and then now it's being touted as fact.
this is something that is so very common for transition officials to do and yet people have had no idea about any of this in the past and are happy to eat up the bs they hear around here.
there are plenty of legitimate issues with what has gone on that you don't need to sound dumb trying to defend the idea he broke some 200+ year old law that no one has ever been prosecuted for and wasn't intended for this purpose.
legally?
it's probably a grey area but is well defined in precedent and is something the last several administrations would be guilty of if you suddenly decided to give a shit.
this isn't new to dt so get your shit figured out, and either look into what you're saying before you say it or just bow out of political discussion for lack of knowledge.
no one would be hurt to see less ignorance.
do you have sources to back up your assertion of precedent?
[here](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/12/us/politics/12summit.html) is a nyt article that talks about obama's team's planned meetings with foreign officials.
full disclosure; he was much more faithful to the idea of not undermining the current administration but still definitely took part in these types of meetings.
i found it much harder to cite that claim considering it was never really too much of a concern before dt's team got involved with the lying and such.
i can probably cite others if you find that to be unsatisfactory.
also, have an upvote for asking for citations.
thanks for following up - i'll read it later tonight.
neat, but it's entirely missing the context of the current situation aka russian involvement in the election and sanctions.
oh, and the growing evidence of the winner of said election colluding with russia and lying of said contacts with russia.
if it wasn't illegal post election, why lie about it?
there is a law against seeking to influence foreign governments, their officers and agents in respect of any dispute or controversy with the us unless duly authorized, (by the current president, not president to be).
there's no law against meeting or interacting with such people.
that's why flynn admitted the contacts but lied about the content of conversation.
your argument is as reasonable as responding to an accusation of theft of money by questioning whether theft of money is illegal given how common obtaining money is.
yeah, keep repeating that idiotic line while the indictments continue to pile up.
right, now if only we could get some indictments that are related to russian collusion and not lying to the fbi.
i want this to happen as much as you i'm sure but lets not take anything vaguely related to dt and make it news of ru collusion.
let's wait for real evidence of that to come out.
if you can't figure out that the indictments are related to russian collusion that's your problem.
&gt;i want this to happen bullshit.
&gt;let's wait for real evidence of that to come out.
we already have plenty of it.
except in the minds of conspiracy nuts because it's reported in the "main stream media", and everything is made up to hurt poor trump.
&gt;if you can't figure out that the indictments are related to russian collusion that's your problem.
well michael flynn's at least is related to lying to the fbi.
why he lied and what it means is another discussion, but it's one based in speculation and not provable fact.
we're going to have to wait and see what comes of it.
other than that there isn't much in the way convincing evidence so far except just the sheer amount of bs that's gone on.
&gt;&gt;i want this to happen &gt;bullshit.
thanks for letting me know how i feel.
just because i'm not foaming from the mouth about every made up headline, and have been waiting to see something come of it doesn't mean i'm not ready for america to have some respect for itself again.
don't confuse people who don't 100% agree with you as people who 100% disagree with you or else you'll be alone.
you've been here 7 months.
you probably are young and only came for the election bs that's been on reddit but i've been here long enough to know that it wasn't always this vitriol and people used to actually give a shit about sourcing and facts.
i doubt you're much older than highschool but one day you'll see things change for the worse too and when it does, if you have any introspective voice, maybe you'll realize that this attitude is partly responsible for that.
&gt;we already have plenty of it.
this is obviously not true or else we would be talking about dt impeachment today rather than talking about finding evidence that can lead to his impeachment.
don't let all the speculation that you've heard convince you that it's anything other than just that.
there are plenty of people looking into it right now, and it's their sole job so we will find what there is to find but we haven't found it yet.
&gt; except in the minds of conspiracy nuts because it's reported in the "main stream media" a couple things here; i don't know if it makes you feel better to point out that people who don't trust large media outlets are conspiracy nuts but the irony is you're doing it in a sub that was originally created because people didn't like the influx of posts of a sketchy nature that were plasturing the front page of r/news.
again, you're new here so no one blames you for having no idea but what i'm saying is, keep this kind of stuff to facebook and leave the informed discussion to those that are informed.
you can't bash on these people for whitewashing what it is they disagree with when you're guilty of doing the exact same thing over and over in 3 comments worth of space.
just food for thought.
australian here - when was he indicted ?
flynn pled guilty last friday.
even if he's indicted we won't stand for that shit, it's all bullshit.
time to move on.
no one gives a damn what you will or won't stand for.
you're irrelevant.
he pled guilty, holy fuck, are you now denying reality itself?
you have trump supporters in alabama continuing to back a pedophile in roy moore, you're going to have to try harder than that.
this **is** interesting though.
you apparently created this account to come here and deflect to roy moore, and were instantly replied to by someone feeding the argument.
david brock doesn't hand out checks for free, really.
gj spotting that shit.
nice find are you saying there's a secret society trying to discredit roy moore?
&gt; you have trump supporters in alabama continuing to back a pedophile in roy moore, you're going to have to try harder than that.
trump himself said that he could murder someone on television and his supporters would still stay with him.
that is the kind of people many of them are.
here is a really good book on the mindsets of such people: http://theauthoritarians.org/downloads/theauthoritarians.pdf it was written during the bush presidency, which was quite horrible as well.
&gt; you're going to have to try harder than that.
for what?
it seems likely that trump will end up being impeached anyways.
oh yeah!
today will be the day that the dirty dirty drumpf goes down!
in peach!
in peach!
buttery males!
pottery barn!
the only response inbeach now!!!
any evidence?
what _would_ constitute evidence for you?
apparently 'you looked' and the accounts of 9+ women, their contemporaneous recountng of those accounts to friends and family, a signed year book, a former police officer's account, and the fact that he was barred from a mall because of his actions involving minors, is not sufficient.
so what would be?
thanks for specifying the actual evidence.
he'll just reply that it's not evidence which shows he doesn't know what the word means.
it's simply a double standard.
ray moore himself didn't deny it at first even though hannity tried hard to give him the throw.
even if moore was caught in the act hiting on a teenage girl he would find a way to discredit it.
it's straight from their playbook.
_present evidence_ &gt; that's not evidence _secure indictment_ &gt; there's not a shred of evidence _secure guilty plea_ &gt; well, he was an admitted liar _show involvement in conspiracy_ &gt; well what about hillary and pizza?
_impeach_ &gt; fake news!
it's just a bunch of teenage trolls and paid shills employing the debating tactics of 5th graders, and thereby winning over a decent chunk of complete fucking morons.
lol i see the same thing when people deny russian involvement in the us election and brexit.
*show evidence of russian-bought advertising accounts* &gt; that's not evidence *show images used to influence people which were created and distributed by said russian accounts* &gt; nobody believed that anyway and it's not evidence.
*show how many followers these russian accounts had and note that's more than the margin of difference in the brexit vote* &gt; that doesn't mean people voted one way or another and it's still not evidence, it doesn't matter.
[look, you've been proven wrong, so stop talking.
you've had your say already.
be quiet, okay?
everything's fine.

just to note, and i'm not taking any sides on this, but he wasn't barred from that mall.
the former owner came out and said they had gotten a few complaints about him but nothing meriting a ban.

when its bill clinton being accused of rape, trump supporters do not need any evidence.
when its their guy, they need to see him fucking a teenager in person, in order to believe it.
what is it with trump supporters and paedophilia?
first is defending milos outrageous argument of adults and 14 year olds having sex, now its roy moore.
something tells me pizzagate was just self-projection.
"clearly an imposter!
our trump would never do such a thing!"
-- supporters republicans - the party of family and values, but will stand their ground when it's time to defend a pedophile as long as they need him to push their political goals.
im pretty sure even then they wouldnt believe it.
or they would try to justify it because if their guy is doing it, clearly its acceptable.
he did have an r next to his name on the ballot after all.
im convinced the ballot could be jesus (d) and satan (r) and these stupid fuckers would still vote r it becomes an ethics question that is supporting roy moore for the seat in the senate good enough cause to overrule your moral stance on the allegations (that other people have linked) agaisnt him.
if that was the case, they'd force moore to step down in favor of strange.
but republicans have no qualms voting for the scumbag that is moore.
yes, there is.
i also hear micuhael posts us politics in the worldnews sub.
so many reasons not to like that micuhael i love how everyone knows and yet everyone would rather make jokes and be sheep as we all become slaves.
: / does flynn’s actions genuinely represent collusion or illegal activities?
we still do not have evidence of a “quid pro quo”, because there’s no evidence stating that russians agreed to manipulate the election to lift sanctions that would allow flynn’s business partners to build nuclear power plants in the middle east.
there’s a pretty big missing piece there... &gt; does flynn’s actions genuinely represent collusion or illegal activities?
yes.
how so?
is collusion actually illegal?
what constitutes an illegal activity in this case if collusion itself is not a crime?
acquiring items of value from a foreign government during an election is illegal.
collusion has value.
where is that stated in law as illegal?
particularly in this case, since flynn was working with russian businesses on his own behalf.
are flynn’s actions taken upon the behest of president trump with the promise that the russians agree to help trump win the election by social engineering public opinion?
where’s the burden of proof that agreement ever occurred?
according to law, collusion is not illegal and the only thing that flynn did that was illegal, is that he lied to the fbi about his relationship with russian businesses, which could implicate flynn in other deviant business behavior, i.e.
fraud or laundering, but that isn’t necessarily indicative of illicit behavior by trump himself, or his administration.
so, who here believes that indictments came down and flynn entered a guilty plea, but insists that there's absolutely no evidence?
go ahead trumpers, use your downvotes, show us your expert opinions of how investigations work.
secret?
speculation journalism, because speculation on what will be said gets more clicks than what is actually said.
this is it!!!!!!
aren't you tired of losing yet?
because if there is one thing trump has been dead wrong about is that i'd get tired of winning.
ho hum, dead horse beaten to death, and they are still hitting it with a stick... oh boy!
we really got him now!!!
bullshit.
teflon trump.
nothing sticks, the guy will likely start the big one, and at that point, he'll probably win his second term.
because nothing 'unites the states' like a rumble... until it doesn't.
but he won't be impeached.
it would've happened already.
amurican muhmicuhael 17 agencies experts say it may be so...debunked...anon...it's happening...collusion... all i hear are salty tears hitting the floor only a matter of time now.
&gt; "experts say" pretty sure you don't need an expert to read or interpret a text message.
hey the story won't spin itself into a trump-hating clickbait article do people who post this kind of clickbait stuff know that we're at the point where more clickbait headline stuff without ironclad hard evidence actually helps trump at this point since any new info will be dismissed as just another rehashing of old accusations?
what's a secret text message?
isn't all private communication secret?
i wouldn't even know how to send a public text message.
people have been saying trump colluded with russia for over a year with not a shed of evidence to support it.
when are these clickbait headlines gonna die out?
when mueller finishes his investigation, and either indicts or doesn’t based on his findings.
with so many members of his cabinet lying to congress about meetings with russians, do you seriously believe there’s absolutely no chance he did anything wrong or that an investigation shouldn’t be taking place?
what if it turns out that he did commit crimes by working with russia during the campaign?
will you still back him just because he’s “your” criminal?
seriously, ask yourself that question.
if the answer is yes, then you should go think about what that answer means about you.
how can you not see there have been tons of shreds of evidence to support it?
lol nice user name the left lost the election to an outsider, they will be forever butthurt.
they couldn’t keep trump out via legal means so now trump is a master colluder, super spy, working with the russians.
the russians have obviously been doing things to undermine us public opinion on issues but trump didn’t have anything to do with it.
i'm sure flynn will happy to hear he plead guilty for nothing.
micuhael better watch whe he texts.
micuhael sounds russian, i guess.
the dems are desperately grasping at straws trying to make anything stick to the donald and have utterly failed in every pathetic attempt.
give it a rest already as you've only succeeded in discrediting yourself.
how much of a disgusting, racist, inbred moron do you have to have been to actually vote for trump?
do you honestly believe those shitty memes... look at his name and you'll find your answer.
what?
was that supposed to make sense?
i'm basing what i said on facts.
assuming there was collusion, what law was violated?
the law against collusion.
so let's say they prove that trump definitely worked with russia to get elected, what would happen?
worse case scenario for trump is he'd get impeached .
.
politicians can get away with anything.
on both sides of the isle.
it's sickening.
\&gt; implying there's a real difference between r and d there is a massive difference, are you blind?
both are fucking you over.
sure, they might have different flourishes, but let’s not mince words.
they are saying one thing and doing something else, and that something is dry anal—on the citizens.
that is pure grade a bullshit.
the republicans repeatedly tried to pass a bill to remove health care from people, that would directly kill 25k americans.
they passed a bill to steal 1 trillion dollars from the poor and middle class to give to the rich.
and you claim both sides are the same?
fuck off.
[removed] fuck you i am almost swayed by your cogent and well-crafted reply.
it is clear that you have mastered the art of objectivity.
michuokakau flynn common grab your friends we are going to distant lands!
way to spell, no-spell.
it costs $1b to elect a president now, no one should be surprised that the only players in the game are unscrupulous people.
did they find any putin diq-pics?
at this rate even if there concrete proof of putin putting trump in the white house, we'll never know.
efforts to pollute our perception and trust in reports has just been that good.
the downside though is that we'll trust democracy less too.
oh wait, not a downside, because democracy is overrated anyway.
right, vlad?
that's a weird way to spell israel.
who urged kushner to tell flynn to talk to the russians?
netanyahu!
i hope they don't shut down the dispensaries and then gouge us through the nslc.
anything more than $10/g (including tax) will just drive people back to the black market and undermine the benefits of legal weed.
if they're following us here in ontario, that's precisely what will happen.
and it definitely won't kill the black market, as i highly doubt they can compete with cost:quality over what i get now.
they *can* compete, weed costs fuck all to produce.
the question is *will* they, and of course they won't because look at the fucking lcbo.
well said.
we're on the same page there!
if theres still a black market than theres still money being spent on police fighting weed just like always.
there's no way the cops would allow that free money to slip out of their hands.
agreed, that's what i truly believe ontario's plan is essentially set up for.
the opp has flat out said 'we aren't ready for legalization', and that at least partly means they aren't ready to stop going after it (as less 'crime' means less cops needed for it).
anything more than $7.14 ( i get 14g for $100) including tax i know me and all my friends won’t change.
a simple text gets good quality weed delivered to my door.
why would i change if it’s more expensive.
it's like they don't understand that anyone can grow good weed in their basement with an investment of like ~$250.
it's not like good quality alcohol, cocaine, or cigarettes which take large investments to produce and must be made in bulk and then sold to get a return on investment.
there's a reason why it's called "weed".
when anyone can legally grow it in their basement (up to 4 plants legally at least), high weed prices at the nslc will just make more people either grow it at home to save money or buy it from their friends who've already started growing at home to save money.
that means less tax revenue for the government from nslc weed sales.
if this was done intelligently and nslc weed prices including tax undercut the costs of growing it yourself (or the rate from buying in bulk from illegal growers), nslc's weed business would be booming and the government would get tax revenue.
i could see how someone might be concerned at the idea of the nslc flooding the market with cheap weed, but idk how else the nslc is going to attract enough customers away from their already cheap, convenient, and discreet methods of buying cheap weed.
your dealer even delivers!
ns marijuana policies should be made by people who know the industry, not people who think we can reduce weed smoking by taxing weed like cigarettes.
too bad lahey won't be around to get his weed from the lc instead of ricky's overpriced dope or the shitty mall dope.
whats' ricky going to do now to keep lucky happy?
gonna train some raykins to steal the dope it's amazing how ill-conceived all of this is.
i'm all for legalization but this is how we end up with crappy products.
let dispensaries thrive, they know what they're doing.
nslc employees are usually clueless.
i walk into the liquor store and buy a shelf of vodka?
no problem.
i try to buy 31 grams i'm now a criminal.
they're taking advice from all the wrong people.

the province said most health organizations it spoke to suggested a legal age of 21 or 25, citing protection of young people, but admitted 19 was most realistic to keep in line with age limits for other substances and to keep young people from going to the black market for weed.

i'm really hoping this doesn't end in war independentists are really hoping it ends in war i’m speaking simply from a humanitarian aspect.
bloodshed isn’t a good thing plus there's the fact that catalunya doesn't have a standing army.
if it came to open bloodshed, many *many* people would get killed, even if they ultimately prevailed.
that was my thought process.
their “army” if that’s what you would call whatever they’d be able to assemble, would have no match against spain’s military that would be called massacre.
this time their army won't have the nazi's helping them.
i don't want war either but it seems like they are all for it.
the (ex-)catalan government tried to buy war weaponry and enough ammunition to fuel a small war but the central government didn't allow it.
imagine what would have happened if they did get it and "someone" shot the catalan president?
these guys are fucking insane.
that would have been a dark path to go down for sure thankfully that isn't at all the situation here.
agreed no we don't.
we're pacifists, the only violence so far has come from the spanish side.
we just want to leave that's not quite correct.
you don't want to leave.
you want to secede.
yes, leave taking our country with us.
cut it with the fairy tales, that fad ended back in 1945. make a tally of the aggressions, you know i'm right.
the only ones that have attacked people are spanish police and fascist thugs that feel protected this is the best tl;dr i could make, [original](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/nearly-50-000-march-in-brussels-for-catalan-independence-1.3319036) reduced by 75%.
(i'm a bot) ***** &gt; nearly 50,000 people marched through the eu quarter of brussels on thursday in support of catalan independence and the region&amp;#039;s deposed president, who has avoided arrest in spain by taking refuge in belgium.
&gt; mr puigdemont, who like many in the crowd wore yellow in support of jailed separatist leaders, addressed the crowd in catalan before switching to french to direct a message to mr juncker.
&gt; a short distance away in the eu executive&amp;#039;s headquarters, mr juncker&amp;#039;s deputy frans timmermans told reporters he welcomed the &amp;quot;very positive atmosphere&amp;quot; of the demonstration, which took place as campaigning has got under way for a catalan election on december 21st.
however, mr timmermans, the former dutch foreign minister, said there was no change to european commission policy that the dispute between madrid and mr puigdemont&amp;#039;s administration, now removed from office.

not a single word in this whole article about us/french/nato war of aggression that toppled the government and extrajudicially murdered its leader.
guess the massive bombing of the countries military for totally non-defensive reasons (war crimes) had nothing to do with this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgcd1ghag5y wow the auto tl;dr went a bit anti semitic here.
please read the article as it is decently written, and is not at all summed up well by the tl;dr arguing against israel policies makes me anti-semitic?
interesting choice by the autotldr.
germany has a similar pay-to-leave program in place and the eu declined to fund italy's efforts to rescue asylum seekers, so the program was stopped.
&gt; &gt; in 2008, several years before the arab spring, italy agreed to pay muammar al-qaddafi—who by then had ruled libya for 39 years—$5 billion over 25 years as reparations for their colonization of the african country.
in exchange, qaddafi agreed to stem the flow of refugees to europe.
together, both countries began to capture asylum seekers who'd made it to sea and return them to libya.
later, qaddafi insisted that the european union pay libya $6.3 billion annually to keep refugees from reaching europe .
.
.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in 2013, there are news reports that militias are using tripoli zoo to house asylum seekers from sub-saharan africa in cages.
&gt; &gt; &gt; after the arab spring, asylum seekers from the horn of africa headed toward israel in large numbers .
.
.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in may of 2017, libya's coast guard fires upon a humanitarian rescue ship.
"the luventa, a vessel operated by german charity &gt; &gt; &gt; the number of asylum seekers reaching italy's shores plummeted in 2017, but as recently as 2013, italy was running a highly successful rescue operation called mare nostrum.
implemented after the lampedusa tragedy that resulted in 359 african asylum seekers drowning in the mediterranean, the program saved over 150,000 lives.
italy asked the e.u.
for funding to keep the rescue program operating.
the e.u.
declined, and italy was forced to end mare nostrum.
&gt; &gt; germany's interior ministry proposed intercepting refugee boats in the mediterranean and returning them to africa.
germany is now offering up to €1,000 to rejected asylum seekers in the country who agree to return home.
this is the best tl;dr i could make, [original](https://psmag.com/social-justice/understanding-libyas-slave-trade) reduced by 93%.
(i'm a bot) ***** &gt; in 2012, israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu campaigned aggressively on his commitment to israel&amp;#039;s security, pointing to the razor-wire fence that israel built along the length of the sinai to keep black asylum seekers from entering israel; in 2010, the prime minister referred to them as &amp;quot;a concrete threat to the jewish and democratic character of the country.&amp;quot; the fence worked: few asylum seekers entered israel after its completion.
&gt; unable to kick asylum seekers out, thanks to the mandates of the 1951 refugee convention, in 2013 israel offered asylum seekers $3,500 per person to leave.
&gt; what received less attention was that these asylum seekers amounted to a little under half of those in the country at the time; other asylum seekers, including many from africa, were stuck in the unstable purgatory of the undocumented.

bosnia is a wonderful country.
i visited sarajevo and mostar last year.
sadly since the war the formerly relatively secular muslim population has been massively radicalized.
there are even illegal jihadi training camps in the mountains.
plenty of funding from saudi and emirate *sponsors* is used to build new mosques and further radicalize the population.
something really has to be done.
too late... the eu can do something!
they are getting an eu army up soon, send them in to fight the jihadis.
after all, bosnia is on the eu border.
please don't.
that didn't go well for anyone last time.
air pollution is also being linked to dementia.
it isn't just babies.
i could see specifically alzheimer's being affected by air pollution: 1. the disease makes the brain less able to handle toxins 2. whatever symptoms one might have had from the disease would be exacerbated by air pollution-caused brain damage i have read that leaded gasoline, which fortunately is no longer widely used, lowered the average iq by six points.
i wonder how this has contributed to the number of dementia sufferers?
violent crime also dropped drastically after we moved away from leaded gasoline.
it's just a correlation as far as i know but it's a pretty darn strong one if you look at statistics everything i know about lead and in particular tetra ethyl lead, makes this plausible to me especially if there is a correlation between brain dysfunction/injury and crime which i believe there is.
tetra ethyl lead was a tragically bad move -- it does not qualify as a mistake since the dangers were well-known from the time it was being introduced as an additive to gasoline.
the only extenuating circumstance is that at that time perhaps they could not have known that cars would be so widespread in use but i doubt whether that would have changed their opinion anyway since it meant only greater profits.
air pollution is being linked to everything currently.
it's amazing to see how concerted an effort it is right now.
i guess people are not scared of the ice caps melting anymore.
as long as it doensn't cause autism of gayness, noone cares it seems.
we can get the evangelicals onboard by saying toxic air will cause gay autistic judaism in their youth!
i'll bring that up at the next meeting of the world conspiracy department.
i will make sure to casually mention it when i walk past a soccer mom again.
together we can beat this thing!
you know most evangelicals like jewish people, right?
how dare people pay attention to the environment and scientists!
if only poor people brains were as valuable as the wealth created by that pollution.

on bad days, riding a bike in london is actually detrimental to your health because of how bad the air pollution is, over and above the benefits of exercise.
that's fucking terrifying to me.
&gt; on bad days, riding a bike in london is actually detrimental to your health because of how bad the air pollution is, over and above the benefits of exercise.
it was even worse in the past i think.
stuff like the following comes to mind: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_smog_of_london &gt; the great smog of london, or great smog of 1952 sometimes called the big smoke,[1] was a severe air-pollution event that affected the british capital of london in early-december 1952.
**a period of cold weather, combined with an anticyclone and windless conditions, collected airborne pollutants – mostly arising from the use of coal – to form a thick layer of smog over the city.
it lasted from friday, 5 december to tuesday, 9 december 1952 and then dispersed quickly when the weather changed.
** &gt; it caused major disruption by reducing visibility and even penetrating indoor areas, far more severe than previous smog events experienced in the past, called "pea-soupers".
government medical reports in the following weeks, however, estimated that up until 8 december, **4,000 people had died as a direct result of the smog and 100,000 more were made ill by the smog's effects on the human respiratory tract.
more recent research suggests that the total number of fatalities was considerably greater, about 12,000.
[2]** &gt; london had suffered since the 1200s from poor air quality,[3] which worsened in the 1600s,[4][5] but the great smog is known to be the worst air-pollution event in the history of the united kingdom,[6] and the most significant in terms of its effect on environmental research, government regulation, and public awareness of the relationship between air quality and health.
[2][4] **it led to several changes in practices and regulations, including the clean air act 1956.
** as someone who has never lived in a major city, it's the first thing i notice whenever i go to a metropolis like london or new york.
the air is thicker and warmer.
it's not noticeably harder to breathe but it's different.
no birth control.
no abortion.
no epa.
keep them coming to this toxicity.
$$$ for da gop and rupert murdock.
and they claim to be “pro-life” you might live where there's clean air.
but take it easy on the bug spray when there's children around.
republicans rejoice at the influx of future voters self-reinforcing, entropy generating, feedback loops that's a pretty harsh way to describe san francisco, but accurate.
smelling ones own farts will do it ah, i see you too are a man of culture more bad news.
what are we doing to the planet?
earth's history as of late looks like a snuff porn.
well, one option is genghis khan's method, like the ones used in central asia that resulted in sparsely populated regions there, by using unconventional tactics of population control.
south asia : 12 million east asia and the pacific: 4 million no info about the last million?
im gonna say salt lake city, ut.
we are ranked first or second worst in the world every winter.
it gets so bad you can’t see more than like 100 feet in front of you.
in the *world*?
definitely not.
in the us, sure.
yeah you’re right.
for some reason i thought the world, it’s just the worst in the us.
it makes me feel terrible every winter.
the world needs ditch diggers too you'll get nothing and like it!
thanks to india is it?
air is only getting exponentially worse as nothing is really being done.
&gt;authorities say the situation is unlikely to improve in the next few ~~days~~ decades or even centuries ftfy ....says article written in 1996. carly stern, ceo and owner of unicef usa also makes 521k yearly salary off of donations.
not a fan of that guy.
what happens to babies after they're born is their responsibility!
if they worked harder and bootstrapped themselves into wealth they wouldn't have to breathe air.
also, coal is good for you, climate change and toxic air is a soros conspiracy - gop too many humans on earth.
cause------effect.
some might say we should reduce the population by 80% i’d settle for 79% where are all the „fukushima will kill all of us fraggels“?
as long as they're born!
-the gop, probably.
neat clean, beautiful coal ftw.
perfect, they will match the other 7.5 billion people on this planet.
you meant this entire sub?
im going to start dumping plastic right in the river nextdoor, eat only meat from new zealand, drive a hummer and live as hedonistic as possible so that climate change happens faster.
because at this point i just want to see humanity perish.
i probably wont and continue to drive my old shitty, light car, buy only locally produced food and avoid plastic like the plague.
but im the weirdo for trying (__)====d~~climatechange~~
oh, that's where we put them.
so hard to keep track of these things it's surprising that we haven't woke up to story like: today the pentagon announced that due to an unexpected bureaucratic and procurement snafu the us army accidentally captured two central african nations.
sources familiar with the incident say it began when local tribal elders refused to sign for the delivery of 22,000 replacement lug-nuts for the hum-vee general purpose vehicle.
the resulting firefight quickly escalated into an unintended theater wide kinetic operation (utwko's) as the confusion spilled into multiple neighboring countries.
the error wasn't discovered until air force staff questioned the budgetary impact of the sudden munitions expenditures.
pentagon officials say it is still too early to determine which two countries have been captured.
en pointe i thought isis was gone no, they are still in syria east of the euphrates bordering iraq and in a large 7200 km^2 pocket west of abu kamal.
https://twitter.com/a7_mirza/status/938709543260971009/photo/1 there are also several isis pockets in hama and southern syria next to israel and jordan, these areas are surrounded by the rebel opposition so fighting isis in these areas is not aided by russia.
yes, i noticed the russian military, disconnected from reality, declared syria free of isis yesterday.
this is just propaganda for internal russian consumption, there's an election in russia due in 3 months time.
also, it gives russia ability to tell the us to leave syria.

it shouldn't be up to russia to tell the u.s to leave syria.
it should be up to the syrian government and then the u.n. but nevermind we know the u.n doesn't actually have any bite anyway.
for now it will remain nothing more than humanities attempt to look civilised.
what do you think the us will do with the kurds?
russia is trying hard to gain their favour, they bombed weet of the euphrates in support of the kurds today.
seems the us is attempting to help the kurds to establish a homeland in syria, to counter the syrian dictatorship.
they have a very progressive democratic constitution that gives equal rights to women, and guarantees protection of ethnic and religious minorities.

geopolitically, it would make sense for the u.s to continue its support for the kurds.
this is especially true since the relations between turkey and nato have eroded sharply and since iraq and syria are holding hands with iran whom the u.s political establishment has designated as their second favourite bogeyman after nk.
israel has previously shown support for the kurds too.
personally i support the kurdish desire to form their own state but at the same time acknowledge the geopolitical flames it may fan and the bloodshed that will likely follow in trying to achieve its creation.
as we've seen in iraq recently.
exactly - someone had to step into their shoes and keep taking the fight to assad.
assad isnt being fought by the us and thats good not directly, or at least not to the extent that when they kill a bunch of government forces they can't plausibly claim that it was an accident.
they are however funding, training, supplying and otherwise supporting the groups which are fighting assad so you're splitting hairs here.
trump supporters were so critical of hillary's planned syrian buildup, too.
what a conartist trump is.
maybe they will finally find the missing trillions now.
i thought they confirmed this a couple of weeks ago?
no, a couple weeks ago it was the completely bizarre headline, "pentagon to confirm 2000 is troops in syria".
like some kind of bizarre teaser after getting the press agenda for the next week... we knew about this before the tomahawk strike on the airbase.
it was one of the main reasons behind the strike.
prevent the possibility of wmds being used on u.s forces.
that tomahawk strike disabled the airfield for [about a day](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/08/syrian-warplanes-take-air-base-bombed-us-tomahawks/).
it was, in its entirety, trump's way of showing he won't back down without him actually doing anything substantive.
he warned the russians, who warned assad, and so actual damage from the attack was minimal.
it looked cool, and it certainly made for impressive headlines and a couple hours of worry on the night of, but if that strike was supposed to limit syria's ability to conduct chemical attacks in any way it didn't.
i'm not convinced any of that is a bad thing, mind - i personally think the way it was handled was about the best we could hope for in a trump era missile strike, but an attack to limit syrian capability it wasn't.
it was a show of force.
did i say $500?
i really meant $2000.
simple math!
shock and r/aww god [damn](http://i.imgur.com/evlwre8.gifv) you so what that really means is there's about 6000 10k if you count "non combat support roles" and "private contractors" once, the us supported rebels to abolish syrian president bashar al-assad and later focused on assisting kurdish militias battling isis.
pentagon spokesman eric pahon said in a written statement that the us military mission in syria would continue until areas reclaimed from isis are stabilized, adding that “us troops would only withdraw when conditions on the ground allowed,” pahon added: “to ensure an enduring defeat of isis, the coalition must ensure it cannot regenerate, reclaim lost ground, or plot external attacks,” recently, a senior us military commander said 4,000 american troops are in syria, while pentagon said there are only 500. after the defeat of terrorists in the region, the syrian defense ministry called the presence of us troops an “act of aggression and an attack on the sovereignty of the syrian arab republic as well as a gross violation of the charter and principles of the un,” and asked for their “immediate and unconditional withdrawal."
that's equivalent to deceiving us, i realize there are these military secrets but why send your troops to place where there are other forces already working for peace.
its totally loss of american life for no reason there's no good reason that they can easily sell to the public like "freedom" or "revenge against them terrorists" so they kept it quiet.
much like all your wars, the goal is to maintain us influence in the region.
&gt; much like all your wars, the goal is to maintain us influence in the region.
this.
we do not like to face the reality that most of our way of life is dependant upon leveraging the less fortunate.
it's really depressing.
imagine the outrage if russia did this.
who needs imagination when you have ukraine.
ah yes, sorry: remember the international outrage when russia did this?
"did anyone forget?"
is a far better question.
imagine if hillary did this.
russia did this.
actually no other country supposed more weapons, troops and did more to escalate the war than russia.
there are the ones that wanted assad to crack down and had his back when he killed more civilians than isis.
exhibit a folks ^^^ this one is titled speaking out of your own ass.
&gt; other forces already working for peace.
like whom?
russia and assad escalated the war in the first place and killed more civilians than isis.
i guess the closest you get to "good guys" are the kurds and that's the group the us is supporting.
the us spent most of its energy backing the opposition forces, the kurds are mostly sdf / rojava ypg - and while we consider them allies we didn't do a ton to arm them directly until this year to my knowledge.
it made a pretty big splash when [trump announced he'd arm ypg units](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/us/politics/trump-kurds-syria-army.html).
because it was a *huge* issue with turkey, as they were (and still are) those weapons would wind up in the hands of the pkk.
every country has geopolitical interests and will do their best to guard and promote their interests in a certain region.
often these interests butt heads with the geopolitical strategic interests of others; hence the pissing contest between the us and russia.
it's sad because the local people get caught up in this mess and suffer through great despair at no fault of their own.
what are the troop actually doing there?
vacation?
creating profits for the mic.
illegally invading a sovereign country.
&gt;sovereign lol haha, syria is not sovereign because we've been backing"rebels" there for years.
what funny joke!
and what sovereignty does syria/assads government have now a days?
not that much.
can we please stop pretending we have a democracy, or a republic, or anything else based on participation and/or representation of the governed?
there is no correlation between public opinion and public policy, but the top 1% has a virtually 1-to-1 correlation between what they want and what the government does, and it's no wonder, because all the mechanisms of our electoral and legislative systems are ultimately based on purchasing power.
the military and covert services do what the corporate-finance plutocracy wants then to do, the politicians do what their donors (also the corporate-finance plutocracy) want.
the owners of the military-industrial complex are just one arm of this ruling elite, who pursue their own economic interests the same as any of the others, and in this globalized capitalist economy, none of them have any loyalty to any locality-- aside from a handful of nationalistic maniac ideologues who are as anti-human as their profit-driven counterparts, their only loyalty is to profit.
most of them no longer even bother with the now obviously untenable arguments they used to use to rationalize their rule-- that their system is democratic, or that capitalism serves everyone... the average person is so disillusioned that even if they don't understand the specific truth of the situation, they are pretty clear on the fact that they're being screwed and lied to, hence the complete distrust of our institutions (government, the corporate media, banks, etc.)...
i'm just so sick of people having myopic reactions like "this is out of hand-- this is why we need a democrat in the white house," as if we've had any more control over our government and it's imperial military actions during the last dozen democratic presidents.
as if we learned nothing when obama continued bush's military doctrine, continued torture, expanded mass surveillance to the recording of all digital communications by all americans, created the oversight-free drone assassinations program (and kept expanding it when it was discovered to kill far more civilians than traditional tactics)... i mean jesus... one glance at the donors of someone like obama or clinton and it's no surprise that they act like neocons once in office.
the only decent path forward is one in which we reclaim our institutions by reorganizing them in a way where democratic participation is actually possible, and rule by the rich just buying power is impossible.
systemic change.
just like our ancestors saw as necessary in the face of slavery, or feudalism, or monarchy.
at this point it truly is a choice between an economic and political system based on democratic, left-libertarian principles, or the end of our species' survival.
how long till hilary gets blamed?
well, what did she do?
did she back the promote / uprising?
legit question, i was under the impression her and john mcain were the primary people pushing it several years ago.
uprising ?
you mean us backed covert coup de'tat.
yes.
just letting you know, it's d'etat.
im confused, which conspiracy theory coup d'etat is this about?
there was no "us backed covert coup" in syria.
it started as a civilian uprising and turned into a civil war over the course of several months.
yes that what i meant.
she supported that.
coo de’tat* jesus christ i hope this was meant as a joke kooh day-tah pootie tang exactly that b***h!
how dare she!
what difference does it make??
yea no way we could blame the previous administration for this.
us invades syria.
object: war.
the us hasn't declared war since ww2 are conservatives or liberals outraged?
no, because they're a bunch of braindead zombies.
interventionism is predominantly what is destroying america, get a fucking clue.
too many chicken hawks in power murica going putin mode downvoted, but sending thousands of troops into a country without announcing it, is pretty much a putin move pretty sure trump campaigned on promising to not give away his military moves... http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/07/politics/donald-trump-promises-kept/index.html what difference does that make?
how does that make invasion without even informing your own population cool?
its probably not even legal.
you know what's pretty cool?
isis being defeated.
http://www.businessinsider.com/isis-military-defeat-iraq-syria-2017-11 the pentagon confirms on friday that there are currently 4,000 u.s. troops in syria, rather than the 2,000 previously reported.
so ?
they keep peace till russians destroying all of them ?
shit didn't they like announce this a week ago ?
how many are covert op isis 1,500 probably i invite you to /r/syriancivilwar maybe you could learn a thing or two, it really seems like you're misinformed and clueless.
only zionist arabs think the us help them.
speaking of, how come isis never attacked israel?
that speaks volumes about them.
the gov lies?
nahhhhhhhhhh we have known about this since the tomahawk strike on the airfield.
hey, they need all those us troops to open up corridors for isis so that they can flee the peshmerga/sdf and fight against assad instead and weaken his army.
the answer to the question "why is there still terrorism in syria despite syria having defeated them in most places?"
well, there are still quite a few (turkey-/ us-supported) moderate rebels.
they'll only moderately decapitate you... moderate rebels are terrorists that are on your side unlike the moderate assad and russia forces that will only bomb your family... because rebel hell cannons and tunnel bombs have never killed civilians :)))) because the rebels have never ethnic cleanses non-sunnis :))))) they are there to monitor iran and russia.
hard to believe the us would give out incorrect information.
glad this got cleared up though i don't understand why no one in the west is assassinating the butcher (aka bashar al-assad).
you cut the snake's head, you bomb his crumbling military forces and you let the sunnis create a government that will allow syrians to return from europe to syria.
the russians will live with that if their interests in syria will be preserved.
cause that how it works ,?
worked really well in libya or iraq well, not intervening in syria turned out to be even worse than libya and iraq... and removing the dictator in tunisia worked quite well.
thats bullshit, the only reason why this went on for so long is because of foreign intervention.
if the west had kept out of it it would have ended years ago.
you actually cannot know that.
have you lived to see this alternate timline?
how else do fighters keep fighting without shipments of money and arms?
just look into the amount of arms and money that have been pumped into the 'rebels' coffers and they could barely survive without airstrikes and troops on the ground.
that is if your assumption is that all the weaponry is from the us.
from all the videos i have seen from the region, spotting a us weapon is very rare in comparison, all things considered.
second, let's not either ignore the geo political reasons behind this conflict.
nope, i said 'the west' which means the west and its arab allies .
the only reason why we are there is because the west doesn't want iran and russia to continue to have influence over an assad regime.
the west want to topple him to replace with their own puppet, without western support assad, iran and russia would have taken back control years ago.
you are either ignorant or blind if you see it another way.
well luckily i agree though the way you communicate so far isn't quite approachable.
should i accuse you of all kinds of things simply for not agreeing with every point i make?
perhaps work on that.
yes, the us primarily has seeked to remove russian influence from the middle east, for both geographical and energy reasons, hence the allegiance with saudi arabia.
the toppling of the assad regime is for precisely this reason and was made clear as day when russian stepped in on official terms.
some european countries play their parts in these matters but it is primarily american geopolitics behind these moves, and much of this responisibility is being shifted to israeli hands who have better insight in the politik of the region.
mistakes have been made and the strategy has changed.
well you contradicted me twice and i lost patience.
strange way to agree with someone.
in 10 years libya will still be in civil war.
in 10 years syria will probably still be recovering from damage, but they will have a stable government.
syria was overpopulated anyway.
that was a catalyst for sunni anger.
[if the assad government fell, the shia and alawites would be massacred by sunni fundamentalists who view them as heretics.
](https://youtu.be/id1u6mnakmu?t=749) christian and druse too.
easy peesy, right!
meh.
the more immediate threat has been the various sunni islamist organisations.
assad's regime is vastly to be preferred to those.
assad is part of a regime.
he is not the head of the snake and will be replaced.
plus it gets more complicated.
like egypt, at this point the regime also has drained all possible resources via corruption and have also established themselves doubly as the oligarchy.
with both violently grabbing economical power and political power.
even if they get people to safely vote without being spirited-away, nothing will change like egypt under morsi.
i'm ignorant.
what city were we referring to as israel's capital before today?
jerusalem.
but all the embassies are in tel aviv because the international community considers that jerusalem's status is disputed.
where are israel's parliament and government seated?
jerusalem.
jerusalem.
yup, the real issue is that the us moving the embassy there.
it was left in tel aviv so far to signal that annexing other people's land is not ok. funny how differently we treat annexations.
in this case we say "go ahead, and please take some billions of our tax dollars to build tribally pure settlements to expand your borders."
in russia's case we impose sanctions and threaten wwiii.
but russia annexed crimea and there is no wwiii.
but there’s been plenty of sanctions.
i don’t see any us sanctions on israel.
we subsidize them instead.
somebody decided to use the incorrect s word russia's occupation of crimea resulted in sanctions and global condemnation.
israel faced similar global opposition to its land occupation.
the absence of wwiii hardly justifies either effort.
&gt; threaten wwiii.
that literally did not happen.
'your fight is our fight.
2017 will be the year of offense" https://youtu.be/l7u0y-iu82w?t=1m10s that's a pretty good threat in my book.
i'm sorry, if you have a problem with moving the embassy to jerusalem, then maybe you sure contact one of the 93 senators or 374 house representatives who all voted in favor of https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/jerusalem_embassy_act most of them are still politicians today.
&gt; yup, the real issue is that the us moving the embassy there.
it was left in tel aviv so far to signal that annexing other people's land is not ok. oh.
[so when jordan annexed the west bank, that wasn't ok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jordanian_annexation_of_the_west_bank)?
the totally unbiased un did not condemn the jordanian annexation of the west bank even once.
maybe it's because the [palestinians are actually jordanians](http://www.petra.gov.jo/public_news/nws_newsdetails.aspx?site_id=1&amp;lang=2&amp;newsid=328812&amp;catid=13&amp;type=home&amp;gtype=1&amp;utm_source=eoz+blog&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=post-link&amp;utm_content=elder+of+ziyon)... the development of 'palestinian' as a distinct national identity in its current form is relatively very recent.
jordan annexed it, and then israel annexed it back.
while jordan did extend its citizenship to the palestinians, *the reality* is that no one treats them as jordanian citizens and jordan has withdrawn its claim to the west bank.
so in effect they are not jordanians.
they were jordanians because between 1948 and 1967 the west bank was part of jordan and the arabs that got pushed out of israel were given jordanian citizenship.
now if you want to claim that arab palestine didn't even exist, well that's just fucking stupid.
their president says they are one people with two states.
what do you make of it?
no they’re not.
they were both subject people of the ottomans.
literally the only difference is what side of the line the british drew to start breaking up the british mandate.
he's referring to the palestinians in jordan that now makes up the majority there after the creation of israel.
jordanians and palestinians are two different groups who shares a country, language, and culture but different roots and history.
to be fair, israels annexations have happened in wars started by other countries aimed at annexing all of israels territory.
which makes total sense.
we like israel, we don't like russia.
russia is the new soviet union, same spirit, but smaller.
we want our enemies weaker and our allies stronger.
further, israel gained that land because it was attacked by four countries and they lost.
they started a war and they lost it and then, because those people who lost that war are shitty, they abandoned the people on the land they lost.
the palistinians right of return should be to egypt, jordan etc.
further, they have no strength to negotiate from.
further further, the us, is entirely founded on annexed land, we're not giving our land back.
further again, russia attacked ukraine, it would be different if ukraine had attacked russia, lost, and thus lost land.
if there's any case where land anexation is ok, its this israel case.
the arabs attacked israel at least three times, and lost three times, and finally!
look at this shit.
egipt and the saudi's are allying themselves with israel!
because everyone in that area hates rmt!
so the palistinians have nothing to offer, and they have no friends nationally speaking.
and so why can't we just say there isn't going to be a two state solution?
its been seventy fucking years.
let's do something useful, like save the elephants or go to mars or something.
&gt; it was left in tel aviv so far to signal that annexing other people's land is not ok. oh sure, like the us would do anything as a political statement against israel.
it's more like the arab states declared that "we will get pissed off at any country that recognizes jerusalem as the capital by placing its embassy there!
", and most of the world said "oh my, we don't want that, so ok, we will put it in tel aviv".
while the us thinks "we really don't give a rat's ass what those arab states think of us, but hey, it'll be inconvenient for our embassy staff not being able to party with the germans and aussies if we're in different cities, so sure, tel aviv is fine."
and what trump is doing (and congress has [wanted to do for 20 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jerusalem_embassy_act)) is saying "screw this, if the aussies want to hang with us, they can come to jerusalem, it's a much better party town."
speaking from experience - it is definitely not a better party town!
&gt;tribally pure you realize israel is 25% arab, right?
none.
there was a similar situation with china after the revolutionary war.
there were three sides in that war.
the royalists, the nationalists and the communists.
the royalists lost the sino-japanese war to a country that was widely considered to be sort of like modern afghanistan... just a backwater.
shortly after the royalists flee and the nationalists and communists begin vying for power, both fighting to secure what they can.
the war turns for the worst and the nationalists are forced to retreat.
they retreat to the island of taiwan.
they declare that taiwan is the seat of power for the chinese.
the communists declare that beijing is the seat of power.
now america, britain, france, they all hate communists so none of them recognize the legitimacy of a beijing government.
so they recognize the island of taiwan as the republic of china and refuse to recognize mainland china's authority.
russia is the only one that recognizes mainland china.
this changed when russia went to war with china.
nixon formally recognized mainland china and formally recognized beijing.
it would seem silly, because obviously beijing is the capital of china, but recognizing it as such caused more problems than it was worth.... until it wasn't.
today the muslim world doesn't have as much of an anti-israel hard on as they used to have.
it's risky, but jerusalem is the operational capital of israel.
so far there haven't been too many strong actions from the muslim nations.
a protest in gaza... but that's normal.
russia and china never went to war.
there were some very serious tensions between them, but it never went beyond the point of several skirmishes.
i feel like that's just america's "we've technically never been at war" logic.
they fired weapons at each other in a conflict over territory.
not really, both russia and china acknowledge they were technically fighting a border war.
yes,they did,russian even made a documentary about it.damansky island year 1969 is a 2004 russian documentary film about two battles that took place on damansky island in 1969 between the soviet union and the people's republic of china everyone was pretending it was tel aviv.
except the russians who said it was west j'lem.
oh my gosh the russians are behind this the full russian statement was: &gt; "we reaffirm our commitment to the un-approved principles for a palestinian-israeli settlement, which include the status of east jerusalem as the capital of the future palestinian state.
at the same time, we must state that in this context we view west jerusalem as the capital of israel."
i thought it was tel aviv, only to discover even pretending (wut?)
it's tel aviv is controversial.
that's israeli-palestinian politics for you.
it's pretending because israel's houses of government are in jerusalem.
it would be like everyone saying college park, md was the us capital whilst commuting to washington to meet with legislators at the real capital.
so trump is just.... being honest?
"pretending" israel exists is controversial in some circles.
thinking jews deserve to live is controversial to some.
so is thinking that building settlements in someone else's country is wrong.
til jews became settlers in their own land because of 19 years of arab occupation and ethnic cleansing of jews i googled it yesterday, it said jerusalem, lol.
compton can someone eli5 this situation.
why is it so controversial essentially the land is 'conflicted', and no one has wanted to pick a side til now.
israel has owned jerusalem since 1967-when they took it in a defensive war.
palestinians still claim it as their 'future state', along with all the rest of israel, and parts of neighboring countries.
&gt;israel has owned jerusalem since 1967-when they took **the part of it they didn't already control from jordan** in a defensive war.
added important context funny how israel's "defensive war" always seems to end with them seizing new land, constantly, for decade after decade.
what an expansionary defense!
i could be wrong but i think it was more of a strategic decision.
if the neighboring states had competent military coordination for the 6 day war, they could have wiped israel off the map.
which kinda was their goal in the first place.
they're not just going to give strategic land back to their neighbors who get a hard on every time death to israel is chanted.
well wouldn’t you do the same?
take the golan heights.
they could either have their country overlooked by artellery from a country that attacked them before or after defeating the attack they could seize the land and have themselves in a stronger position if they are attacked again.
the blame lies with the country(s) that attacked in the first place.
it’s pretty lame to start a fight with somebody trying to steel their lunch money, get your ass kicked, and then complain when your intended victim steels yours instead.
it actually makes a lot of sense to have buffer territory between you and your neighbors when your neighbors all want to wipe you off the face of the earth.
and then giving back the land once peace is achieved.
jordan and egypt are good examples.
israel also gave back gaza but we see what happened there.
that's pretty much what happened to germany after both world wars.
territory was seized and borders redrawn for strategic purposes (which is the thrust of almost all peace treaties in human history).
it's not israel's fault that their invading enemies are so shit at fighting.
thank you!!!!
its controversial as the move to take jerusalem is considered illegal by the international community which is why you will see all the worlds embassies in tel aviv in west jerusalem.
this is going to piss off every palestinian everywhere as trump is basically saying he doesn't think palestinians should get their part of jerusalem given to them by the un.
this is probably also going to basically kill off any hope to a 2 state solution anytime soon which is the ideal solution.
there never was a two state solution.
there was a two state dice roll were everything but snake eyes ends badly.
'no one has wanted to pick a side til now' lol you're kidding right?
israel wouldn't exist without help from countries as france and the us.
barely any european country recognizes palestine as a state and most of them recognize israel.
the mentioned dispute was not about israel but about jerusalem.
&gt;barely any european country recognizes palestine as a state some weaselly words there, top cat.
far more countries recognise palestine than don't.
["as of 14 september 2015, 136 (70.5%) of the 193 member states of the united nations and two non-member states have recognized the state of palestine.
"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_recognition_of_the_state_of_palestine) edit:formats on al jazeera currently theyre in ramallah and you can hear loud crowd chants in the back ground.
al jazeera goes hard on israel.
in a biased way.
it's owned by the qatari royal family.
it's notoriously biased.
edit: for everyone https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al_jazeera_controversies_and_criticism sure.
however, i will say of organizations in the middle east, al-jazeera is one of the better ones.
nothing is gonna be perfect.
saudi arabia hates al jazeera too.
that's points for al jazeera to me.
al jazeera is in general a pretty good news organization, with the exception of the israel-palestine conflict, in which case they're very biased because qatar hates israel.
luckily western media is never biased in the israel-palestine conflict.
here in europe all media are very biased against israel.
oh yeah, what other news outlets from the middle east are westerners even exposed to?
so should everyone.
they shouldn't be biased, but everyone should have the balls to acknowledge israels crimes.
your comment is controversial but people do like to forget about the relatively recent war crimes israel has been up to and was never held accountable for.
don't use phosphorous on civilians if you want more of my sympathy white phosphorous is [used by all western armies as screening agents and as artificial illumination.
this is exactly what it was used for](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/14/iraq/syria-danger-us-white-phosphorus).
while youre at it google [british col. richard kemp who calls out aid groups and states for bias.
he states unabashedly that israel is one the most moral armies in the world](https://youtu.be/rm_czcp-_cw).
remember we live in a world of misinformation.
if israel really wanted to massively murder gazans they have the ability and the tools to do so.
they would not use white phosphorous to do it.
ask yourself if it makes sense for israel to do this.
then ask yourself who stands to gain by painting israel in a bad light.
critical thinking.
yeah, richard kemp also contributes to breitbart and thinks women shouldn't serve on the front lines because they don't have the 'bloodlust'... so a normal wednesday then?
that’s the laugh track.
every aj broadcast adds it.
&gt; in ramallah.
the capital of the palestinians.
[removed] [removed] [removed] how does this serve the american people in any way?
(really, i can't see a single benefit for the people of the us doing this).
don't us christians believe that jews must inhabit israel to bring about the end of days or something like that?
really this is about appeasing his evangelical handlers.
yep.
this should be on the top, none of the other answers are correct.
evangelicals believe the “second coming” will happen in jerusalem, at which time jews will convert to christianity.
the logic is that jerusalem needs to be in the possession of jews/christians when that happens.
trump made this as a campaign promise to evangelicals for votes.
nothing more.
ya christian zionisim : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_zionism my grandfather was like this.
my dad told me about how my granddad would remark that "they shouldn't be messing with god's chosen people" every time something would happen to israel.
it was especially odd because i had just gotten done doing a college study on the history of anti-semitism in the west, so it threw me for a loop.
i mean i prefer it over christians calling jews usurers and accusing them of blood libel, but it's still strange.
i can't help but feel like this was propped up in the united states by politicians, in order to secure israeli defense contracts or something.
some of trump’s supporters also claim he’s preparing the way for the return of jesus.
i’m pretty sure that when the bible refers to someone appearing right before jesus, it’s talking about the anti-christ.
so there’s that.
food for thought: daniel prophesied that "from the time the command goes out to restore and rebuild jerusalem" until a "ruler" comes and "the end [comes] like a flood" would be 69 "sevens" (some sort of division of time).
69 years after israel was founded as a state, donald trump is the president of the us and seems to be doing his best to stir up trouble everywhere.
daniel also says that this ruler would hold power for one "seven" and after one year trump's position is looking pretty precarious.
that said, most theology professors would probably slap me for that interpretation... that would be pretty interesting if the rebuilding of jerusalem discussed in daniel had not already happened when the book was written.
daniel is one of the books written after the persians allowed the jews to relocate to their homelands.
please stop with this stuff.
interpreting scripture to conform to current events is something religious propagandists have been doing since the shit was written.
"oh yeah it is really happening this time, just as predicted!
we just have to interpret these numbers to mean this and look!
prophecy is coming true!"
30 years later when everyone forgets how wrong they were and some new conflict pops up, they just repeat the same crap with slightly different intepretation.
i thought that closing line there was enough of a "don't take this seriously" disclaimer, but i may have been mistaken.
seriously, they probably stopped reading half-way through to angry-type their response.
yeah.
the dates don't match but most people view it as the return and rebuilding of the temple during the reign of cyrus of persia.
lol, no way trump is the antichrist.
he'll be attractive.
it's also why we are supposed to have separation of church and state... kind of a big part of why our country exists in the first place.
#foundingfathergravedynamo it literally is nothing at all.
in 1995 congress decided to move the embassy to jerusalem, but bill clinton signed a waiver tabling the move for another six months.
every president for the past 20 years has signed this same waiver.
donald trump just announced jerusalem as the capital and his intention to move the embassy there... then signed the waiver forestalling the move for another six months.
this is the second time he's signed this waiver.
it's all just smoke and mirrors, he wears scandal like armor.
it isn't forestalling the decision anymore.
the plans to build the new embassy are now set in motion.
the waiver will be signed until they are ready to move.
it's a big stretch to call this 'nothing at all'.
wait, really?
then why is the media making such a big deal about this particular waiver signing?
did he say something on twitter?
the bbc had been reporting for a few days that trump is "going to" recognize jerusalem as israel's capital or something like that.
because israel is considered contested internationally, and trump is making it sound like he just gets to decide.
&gt; he wears scandal like armor.
best description i've ever read of him.
stock prices for defense contractor companies will probably go up... so there's that.
expecting a favour in return from israel in the future the us had always deferred the official recognition of jerusalem due to national security concerns.
that is however not a concern anymore since last week, when the white house spokesperson [confirmed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/11/29/the-trump-white-house-just-tacitly-endorsed-anti-muslim-propaganda/) that trump addressed the issue of national security by posting some fake anti-muslim hate videos to his twitter account.
you can argue that the u.s. involvement in the peace process has no benefit for its citizenry in that same vein.
if you're talking about peace process, you are talking about the benefit of the israeli and palestinian people.
since israeli are the allies, generally the highlight is on israeli.
furthering israeli interests strengthens ties.
makes israel much more wary of upsetting the u.s. -- under obama, relations were frayed to the point that it couldn't deteriorate anymore.
obama had nothing to bargain with because he lost all influence in israel as they are doing it no favors other than the arms deal, which is something obama would never dare touch.
there are other agreements, but they are fair ones or ones in favor of the u.s. already (agreed due to the arms deal.)
meanwhile, the current u.s. administration has made the israeli administration very happy, and knowing how volatile trump is, they are afraid of getting on its bad side.
this simply further entrenches israel as one whose best interest is to not disrespect the u.s. administration.
all articles--left and right--in israel are praising this move as historic, because the palestinians have been using east jerusalem as something they can bargain for when israel has a basic law forbidding any government from partitioning or forfeiting jerusalem.
essentially, every time israel sits at the bargaining table, palestine says, "if you want east jerusalem, you'd have to concede a, b, c, d, e, and f" -- in negotiations, israel finds itself negotiating for something it already has / it cannot concede.
international recognition of jerusalem as israel's capital will make it so one of the biggest **hurdles** in the peace process are gone because there is no longer a question of jerusalem.
the less there is to negotiate over the easier it is for an agreement to be made.
the palestinian authority, of course, aren't happy, because this is taking away a key bargaining chip.
but in the end, this is all politics--in the end of the day, a deal does not exist where israel forfeits the western wall or gives the right of return to anything but a symbolic amount of palestinian refugees.
those are two key issues that the palestinian authority uses to gain leverage over israel in negotiations, as one would make the government criminals, the other would make israel commit national suicide.
&gt; international recognition of jerusalem as israel's capital will make it so one of the biggest hurdles in the peace process are gone because there is no longer a question of jerusalem.
you know, unless the palestinians do not see it that way.
then it simply becomes an obstacle to the negotiating process because one side thinks it's a bargaining chip and the other doesn't.
i dont think peace process means what you think it does.
well, you see, there's "freedom fighters" and then there's "'insurgents"'... you could argue that....or you can see that the reason the muslim world hates us is mainly due to our support of israel (and saudi wahabbism to a lesser extent).
that hate has materialized into the killings of our citizens in terror attacks.
so maybe peace and not taking sides so blatantly would be in our best interest.
the reason for al qaeda was us bases in saudi arabia.
the reason for isis was us war on iraq, the reason for the taliban was us backing them against russia.. need i go on?
don't blame it all on israel.
&gt; how does this serve the american people in any way?
it's helping the world in a way really imo.
i mean come on, israel is *never* going to accept not having at the very least west jerusalem, it's stupid after so many decades to still say that their presence there can be disputed... it can't and they aren't gonna leave.
they're there to stay and jerusalem is indisputably their capital *as well as* any future palestinian state's capital.
this is like ripping off a plaster, arab nations will complain and posture but the sooner the world comes to accept that *both* countries capitals are in jerusalem then the sooner a 2 party state can become a reality.
the us leads the way, other countries will look to them for guidance on it and when pretty much every country is seen to consider jerusalem as the israeli capital then that's progress.
i imagine after 4 or 5 years with no major incidents then other countries will quietly follow suit.
i mean it's a stupid stance anyway, everyone in the world who has any knowledge about israel knows that jerusalem is it's capital, not recognizing it as such is just retarded.
hell, the us *already* officially voted to recognize jerusalem as israel's capital, not having the embassy there is just... stupid.
so the white house released the official proclamation of jerusalem as capital.
but it some part it still say that jerusalem's status is still going be the subject of a final negotiation.
&gt;today, december 6, 2017, president trump recognized jerusalem, the ancient capital of the jewish people, as the capital of the state of israel.
but then it says: &gt;status of jerusalem: president trump recognizes that specific boundaries of sovereignty in jerusalem is highly sensitive and subject to final status negotiations.
so did he recognized jerusalem as israel's capital or didn't he?
https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-december-6-2017/ he also signed the waiver delaying the embassy move.
he definitely recognized jerusalem as the capital of israel.
he also made it clear that a "dual capital" option is still on the table for future negotiations with palestinians.
i believe he delayed the embassy move purely to give engineers and builders the chance to plan the actual embassy location.
the embassy will 100% be moved to jerusalem though.
it think it's pretty simple.
no matter what, jerusalem is israel's capital.
the only possible variations to this are exactly which parts belong to israel and which parts belong to the palestinians.
quite frankly, i don't think it matters.
israel annexed the land during a victory in war and had no intention of letting it be palestinian land after the arabs all decided to compromise the integrity of the jewish state over and over again.
i’m pretty ambivalent.
let me tell you why.
on the one hand, this is a fresh approach.
over 20 years ago, congress approved the motion to move the embassy to jerusalem, but it’s been 22 years and nothing’s changed.
3 presidents didn’t do anything about it, and now trump’s “amending” this.
i think it’s pretty important to note that a few years ago the us moved their embassy in london to a different embassy and it took about 6 years (if i remember correctly), so there’s a chance that trump may not even be in office by the time this whole process is finished, especially given that the order is to *begin preparation* in 6 months time.
however, and this is a big one, the palestinians are on edge.
hammas leader, haniyah, who never got along with mahmud abass, said that he’s supporting him in leading people to the streets to protest this.
jerusalem is sort of a black flag, *way* beyond red, that’s pretty untouchable.
if 5 million palestinians get up and start marching to the border i don’t know what israel’s response will be, but i don’t think it’s likely.
what is likely is that abass will try to show his disdain, yet acknowledge that trump is insisting on a good deal for *both sides*, and that people should wait because better things are coming.
yet i won’t find it surprising at all if a few young palestinians will uprise and return to the streets, burn tires, protest, a few might stab and shoot at israeli civilians and soldiers as a result, which is unacceptable by any mean.
i’m guessing some red light just flared in abass’ head, indicating that if he doesn’t act fast, he’ll lose even more, after losing the possibility of having jerusalem as palestine’s capital.
that being said, trump did say that eventually the recognition of jerusalem doesn’t specify borders, limits or changes that may occur based on a deal, so abass still has a chance, but time’s running out.
the biggest winner is netanyahu.
he’s getting some credit for being able to talk trump into this pretty historic recognition, and at a time where he and his wife are walking in and out of investigation rooms, and the media tarnishing everything he does and says, this is crucial for him.
a lot of people who find this act incredible will not forget this in the coming elections next year.
this is a very very tricky situation and i really hope that this won’t drive extremists to do irreversible acts that may deepen this rabbit hole.
it will take 3-4 years.
there is no way to rush the new embassy.
trump said this himself.
building an embassy is expensive and requires a lot of special modifications to prevent foreign intelligence from spying into the embassy.
&gt; jerusalem is sort of a black flag, way beyond red, that’s pretty untouchable.
i think you are drawing lines on water.
everything israel has done has crossed red line against whole arab world: declaration of independence, every expansion and so on.
sure, they will be angry, but they have been and always will be.
i agree, the blame is mainly put against israel because it’s israel.
between 1948 and 1967, the west bank belonged to jordan, and palestinian refugees lived in terrible conditions.
jordan didn’t even recognize them as refugees, which meant that they owed them nothing according to international law.
they were treated like class c citizens, but i don’t recall much complaining because they were arabs living under an arab regime.
no one expected jordan to set the west bank as a new country for the palestinians, and indeed they had no intention to do so.
nowadays, people talk about palestine as if it’s existence is a given, while israel’s sovereignty is questionable.
in the past years, people died and took the lives of innocent civilians in attempts to “defend” jerusalem from the israelis.
residents of the west bank refuse to acknowledge even a part of jerusalem as area that belongs to israel.
i don’t remember so much rioting as done against the metal-detectors in al-aqsa mosque on the temple mount towards any other issue - settlements, border patrol, the wall, anything.
all of these are very touchy subjects for both sides, but jerusalem has to be the biggest, baddest one.
why would abass show anything other than disdain about this?
because trump basically postponed any real action.
he could’ve had the embassy move temporarily as of tomorrow to the consulate in jerusalem, but didn’t do it.
he could’ve sent a team in advance and describe the plans for the embassy, but didn’t do it.
heck, there’s a chance that by the time they build the embassy a new president will annul the whole thing.
trump has a deal that’ll probably demand harsh giveaways from the israeli side, and this is his way of sweetening the deal with israel.
if you read what trump said, he clearly states that this recognition doesn’t specify the birders of jerusalem, neither does it define it to be a permanent condition, and that these will be determined by the negotiating sides, therefore - abass still has a say.
however, trump may have come to realize that abass is a quitter who won’t go for anything except a full win-lose deal for the palestinian side, therefore he’s testing him - if abass and the palestinians will make a mess out of this, it’ll prove trump right in recognizing jerusalem as israel’s capital.
but if abass plays nice, and go forward towards a deal, it will leave netanyhau with no choice but to go through with pretty much whatever trump demands in the deal.
there’s a lot for abass to gain from this, but he decided to go with the “fine, we’ll go play with someone else” technique.
it's not a fresh approach.
the us senate voted 90-0 to recognize jerusalem as the capital.
trump did nothing more than agree.
the senate voted, but since then waivers were always signed to postpone the movement of the embassy from tel-aviv to jerusalem.
also, no us president has ever referred to jerusalem as israel’s capital.
trump is saying “we need to keep our word and move the embassy already”, which is the symbolic act of recognizing jerusalem as the capital city of israel.
he just made sure nobody would misunderstand it as anything other than this kind of recognition.
isn't netanyahu in some corruption scandal recently?
feels like too much a coincident that trump create such a good diversion for him to gain back support.
real question is: what is this bloody rt article doing here.
on r/worldnews, of all places?
how dare they interfere with this beacon of truth and impartiality!
rt is a good source how can someone support the israeli settlements in palestine as "returning land to the people."
and not think the north american first nations need more control over their ancestral territories?
because hypocrisy is an american tradition because his daughter and son in law aren't native americans.
that's like asking why michael j fox is always raising money for parkinson's.
[removed] eli5 why this is important?
jerusalem is one of the most holy cities according to both jews and muslims.
when israel was created jerusalem was set up as an independent city state, under the control of none of the surrounding countries.
this was to respect the strong feelings about religion and about who controls jerusalem.
this arrangement did not last long and jerusalem was captured and controlled by the israeli military.
since the presence of israel, the occupation of surrounding lands and the disputed control of jerusalem are all major sources of tension in the middle east, very few countries have recognised israel's control of jerusalem.
the us has tried to reach a peaceful agreement between the arab and jewish population in the lands around israel and palestine.
over the past few decades there have been a number of conflicts concerning control of land, the rights of the arabs and other issues.
one long favored solution has been the creation of two separate states, one called palestine and one called israel.
this has failed for a number of reasons, but one of the big ones is the disputed control of jerusalem.
both israel and palestine want to have jerusalem as their capital, and the long proposed solution is to have west jerusalem as the israeli capital and east jerusalem as the palestinian capital.
trump's move today is significant for a number of reasons.
firstly it will be seen across the muslim world as trump giving jerusalem to israel and the jews.
many muslims are afraid that such a move will result in the destruction of some of the holiest sites in the muslim world.
secondly it damages the prospect for any kind of peace deal between israel and palestine.
and finally it means the us can no longer pretend to be a neutral party in negotiations, and means the palestinians will likely not accept any future peace agreement brokered by the americans.
so jerusalem used to be something like the vatican city?
i feel like it should just be an independent city state again.
also, i'm pretty sure the city is important to christians as well, at least in a historical context.
yes, but the only christian-majority country in the middle east is cyprus, so they’re not really as relevant to the politics of jerusalem as islam and judaism.
was captured by jordan, from 49 to 67, when israel took it did they occupy this when the arabs tried to eradicate israel twice?
or did they do it another time?
super simplified version: that area of the world is extremely volatile with two main groups (and tons of sub-groups within each of those) who claim ownership over certain bits of land, and who have spent literally thousands of years arguing and killing each other over who has the rights to live where.
it's a mess, and for many years, the usa has been **very very** careful to try and not piss off either side *too* much.
it's has been a delicate balancing act for decades.
by officially recognizing anything as the capital of anything, we've dropped the balancing act.
this is a blunt move that might not be received well.
so essentially we chose sides?
lindsey graham on twitter: &gt; i fully support the trump administration’s decision to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel because this statement reflects the reality on the ground for the last 3,000 years.
i guess with that logic all you white europeans ought to leave this land to the natives?
i will when the germanics give back northern europe to the celts.
the guy doesn't seem to be aware that for most of the past 3,000 years jerusalem has been either a pagan or a muslim city.
for most of the past 3000 years jerusalem has been beholden to a pagan, christian, or muslim *government*, but from say 1000bce to the till early roman empire jerusalem was a jewish city and when christian and later muslim populations became significant the jews still maintained a significant presence through most of the medieval period.
it is currently a christian, muslim, and jewish city and has been for quite some time.
he fucking did it, holy shit ~~edit: since this is top comment,[ i would like to remind you all that the palestinians cut ties with the us last month.
](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20171122-pa-cuts-ties-with-us-following-plos-office-closure/) they basically asked for this.~~ what do you mean they asked for this?
from your article: &gt; “the pa has decided to cut its ties with the us administration **in response to the closure of the plo office in washington**,” the palestinian presidency spokesperson, nabil abu rudeina, said in an official statement.
sounds like a tit-for-tat move that has nothing to do with jerusalem.
&gt; the us administration pledged that the plo’s office could be reopened after 90 days if trump believes the pa has entered into “direct, meaningful negotiations with israel".
that seems like a fairly unlikely possibility if i remember correctly the plo’s offices were open originally for the purpose of peace negotiation, and so if the plo’s won't even agree to interact in a peace negotiation, closing it is the us way of pressuring them to negotiate about trump / any other president plan for peace.
taylor force act just got passed in house, if they weren't angry about that, now they have something new to be...lol.
i am reasonably sure that was walked back after the us walked back plans to close the palestinians office in dc for those wondering what the background of that threat is: &gt; seeking retaliation after the wednesday vote by the interpol to admit the palestinians as a full member state, the israeli government is asking the united states to shut down offices of the palestinian delegation in washington.
https://forward.com/fast-forward/383827/israel-wants-us-to-shut-down-palestinian-dc-office/ ah of course.
can only have it one way the absolute madman.
/r/madlads the misinformation on reddit is astounding... the western part of jerusalem is majority jewish and not claimed by the palestinians... the eastern part of jerusalem is arab majority but is still claimed by israel.
the israeli policy since the 80s is that jerusalem is theirs and will never be divided.
the current situation on the ground is that there are currently hundreds of thousands of arabs living in jerusalem that do not have israeli citizenship, do no want israeli citizenship and have no right to decide how their city is governed.
i'm pretty biased towards the palestinians, being one myself, but i fail to see any logic in this move.
israel controls jerusalem and has since 67', there is no threat to israel holding onto jerusalem and no chance in hell the palestinians can take control of any part of it without israel handing it over.
this move will be seen as favorable by israel and no one else.
there will be violence over this, people will be killed over this, both israeli and palestinian.
this move inflames tensions for no real reason that i can see.
maybe this will be seen as the final nail in the coffin of palestinian statehood.
the pa should just disband itself and start pushing for israeli citizenship for all people in the west bank and gaza.
israel destroyed any possibility for an actual two state solution decades ago.
hundreds of thousands of israeli settlers live in the west bank and don't look like they are going anywhere soon.
why do people have to die for this?
how does everyone know that there will be extreme violence?
and what does it say that people support the side that threatens that violence?
people don't have to die for this, but they will.
this is an extremely sensitive issue for both sides and really is one of the biggest reasons for the conflict itself.
i can support the palestinian side without supporting the violence but also hoping/wanting for the israeli side to not intentionally provoke the palestinians.
we know this will end with violence and deaths for little to no gain, so why bother even doing it?
israel's capital is already jerusalem, their government is based there.
how does having a us embassy there instead of a couple dozen miles away in tel aviv accomplish anything?
&gt; the western part of jerusalem is majority jewish and not claimed by the palestinians.. not claimed by the pa. as far as i know, hamas claims all of israel.
the un approved the establishment of israel in 1948, the arabs rejected it.
five arab nations immediately invaded the new israel.
five arab nations got their asses handed to them, signed peace agreement with west bank to jordan, gaza to egypt.
arabs keep attacking israel, lose more ground.
so why would israel care about anything the arabs want, they keep attacking israel.
&gt;but i fail to see any logic in this move i'm assuming we're only getting half the story on this, decent odds of some deal on the side with one (or more) other parties, maybe israeli, palestianian, saudi, iranian, et cetera.
it'll also take some the heat/attention off his other efforts, but whether or not that was the main goal of this is certainly up to debate.
&gt; israel destroyed any possibility for an actual two state solution decades ago.
hundreds of thousands of israeli settlers live in the west bank and don't look like they are going anywhere soon.
i'm pretty sure arabs have destroyed any chance of that at every opportunity since 1917.
&gt;there will be bloodshed well yeah, if the palestinians will start it, as always.
i don't condone it but i don't blame them for being pissed.
he left the door open for a "dual capital".
the ship hasn't changed course, it's just one pier closer.
and for what?
the us has found a means of a) alienating even the most flexible and patient palestinians; while b) frustrating the efforts of the more principled and compromising israelis; while c) empowering and financing some of the creepiest forces in israeli and american society; and d) heaping ordure on the us' own *secular* founding documents.
what is the benefit here that makes all of this worth it?
trump gets to put a check next to one of his campaign promises.
and one of obama's, and bush's, and clinton's.
which is generally a good thing in my opinion.
people should stick to their promises.
fuck trump he can eat a dick.
he did it to make himself look good, that cunt can't see beyond the end of his nose.
jerusalem is israel's capital.
why shouldn't we recognize that?
because it compromises peace efforts?
it has been decades and we've gotten nowhere.
palestine time and time again refuses any deal.
they have never provided a realistic peace deal.
what good has it done not recognizing jerusalem as the capital?
trump is following a 22 years old law.
this was around the time a peace deal was made but the israeli pm when assassinated because of it and the deal on the table was torn to shreds.
&gt; palestine time and time again refuses any deal.
any deal israel is willing to make.
and israel refuses any deal the palestinians are willing to make.
why is it specifically the palestinians who are responsible for getting both sides to agree to a deal?
maybe because israel has offered palestinians as much as 97% (including east jerusalem as the palestinian capital) of what they demanded and instead of even getting a counter offer, were met with terror attacks?
&gt; palestine time and time again refuses any deal.
they have never provided a realistic peace deal which peace deal do you think was realistic from the israelis?
name me one that wasn't hilariously bad for palestine.
of course they won't accept deals that will essentially make them vassals of israel.
camp david.
basically everyone thought it was a great deal for the palestinians.
most people believe that arafat turned down the camp david deal because he was scared that hamas and islamic jihad would start an internal palestinian civil war.
i don't think that there is enough organization on the part of the pa to actually make a meaningful peace deal.
olmert's one, afaik, includede around 96% of the occupied terrotories, as well east jerusalem (includind the weiling wall), and some official israeli territories.
olmert and the israeli gov refused to allow the palestinian government to study the map to see what territories would be actually under their control, of course they won't acceot that.
reading this thread makes me realize that a lot of americans have absolutely no clue what the general sentiment is, outside of the us.
as the great leader would say: sad.
fucking chuck schumer, the warmonger.
i'm surprised about israel's response about this.
haaretz (a very left-wing newspaper in israel that many of it's writers support boycotting israel ) ran a peace supporting this move.
&gt;&gt;trump is not destroying his own peace efforts but grounding them in reality: jerusalem is the capital of israel.
and he’s reacted to arab and palestinian ‘predictions’ (read: threats) of violence with the contempt they deserve &gt;whatever the final municipal borders israelis decide upon, whatever final municipal borders and arrangements might emerge from peace negotiations, whatever else jerusalem may some day be (including a palestinian capital) there is one thing that is absolutely certain: jerusalem is the capital of israel.
&gt; if you are serious about peace you won’t complain about the trump decision because it has no impact on issues that require actual negotiating.
https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/1.827122 haaretz is indeed a left-wing paper.
the op-ed you're referring to was written by a republican american named [elliot abrams] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elliott_abrams).
like liberal us papers, haaretz occasionally publishes op-eds by authors across the spectrum.
you're absolutely right.
another op-ed from haaretz, published yesterday: [trump is bringing bloodshed, not peace, to jerusalem](https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/1.827053) not just republican, but hardcore neocon.
that's an op-ed, not an editorial, written by a former bush adm official.
definitely wouldn't label him as left-wing haaretz also published this op-ed yesterday which promotes the opposite opinion: [trump is bringing bloodshed, not peace, to jerusalem](https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/1.827053) &gt; the u.s. president is apparently willing to wreck jared kushner’s peace initiative, risk widespread violence, destabilize mideast allies and fuel terror just to pander to his political base decent newspapers tend to allow editorials from diverse standpoints.
because the disputed part is east jerusalem, even if israel gives that away, it'll still be left with west jerusalem as the capital just like it was from 48 to 67. it doedsn't have to not make sense in order to get criticism from the other side, it only has to change the status que.
at least in this case trump kept his promise.
it is blatantly obvious most of you didn’t even listen to trump’s speech.
you’re just reading fanatical headlines.
here’s his speech [i don’t want to be informed i like ignorant bliss where i’m always right.
](https://youtu.be/sr3jyhik_ke) wow he's so stupid while this recognition does nothing to benefit the us, the fear of violence shouldn't be a factor.
when is this area ever nonviolent?
more wars, hurray!
/s if the palestinians are free to strive for a unilateral recognition as a state, then why aren't israelis free to strive for a recognition of our historic capital?
there was a temple in jerusalem for 1,000 years before the romans destroyed the second temple and exiled the vast majority of jews from the kingdom of judah.
for 2,000 years in exile, jerusalem remained at the core of jewish identity and in our prayers.
every year in yom kippur, the holiest day of the year, we recite “next year in jerusalem", as we have for two millennia.
jerusalem as our capital has been a part of jewish identity for 3,000 years.
there's nothing controversial about the united states' recognition of this fact, unless you view the jewish people's right for self-determination as a controversial topic in itself.
in a time where other ethnic groups are free to define their own identity, jewish people should be granted the same freedom.
if we can agree that the palestinians have a right for self-determination, then we can agree that israelis do too.
of course it is controversial to recognize as capital a city half of which was illegally annexed by a conquering power against the will of its population.
this will be met with universal condemnation, and for good reason.
"illegally annexed" maybe i am naive, but is there ever an annexation that you can definitively call legal?
crimea?
cyprus?
kuwait?
west bank (to jordan!)?
the reunification of germany was arguably a legal one.
after they were attacked, again, for being jewish.
israel took the spoils of victory, arabs cannot get over the fact they keep losing to jews.
so if an arab army ever beats israels they are completely justified in annihilating it?
i'm not sure that the majority of jerusalem arabs would agree with your stance, as this [poll](https://www.timesofisrael.com/half-of-jerusalem-arabs-want-to-be-israelis-poll/) from 2011 revealed.
&gt;"over half, or 52 percent, of respondents, told pollsters they would prefer “israeli citizenship with equal rights,” while 42% prefer to be palestinian citizens when a palestinian state is established".
it's a very complex issue that can't be simplified by saying that the "population" won't like this decision.
i can shit all over the floor and that would be a better source for that kind of poll than "timesofisrael".
haaretz also reported on this, but it's blocked from reddit so i can't link to it.
&gt;and for good reason nope.
there goes your 2 state solution in deep down pit.
lol at everyone who still thinks zog is a myth.
thanks trump -zog
negative impact to russian and turkish interests.
no.
pretty much everyone living in the region.
arbitrarily making tensions worse for political points is pretty bad for everyone.
pretty much everyone in the world says that trump's decision on jerusalem will make peace in that region basically impossible, but trump is too arrogant and ignorant to listen to reality, when he has so many us evangelicals pushing their lies and propaganda into his ear while stroking his ego.
pretty sure that this is not what makes peace in the region impossible... yes, both sides in that particular area are rather screwed up, but trump pouring gasoline on the fire certainly isn't going to help.
1. there is absolutely no chance that jerusalem (either entirely or in part) will not be the capital of israel after a negotiated peace.
and it's not like the us can't relocate the embassy if for some reason israel did move the capital from jerusalem.
2. there was no reasonable prospect for a peaceful solution anytime in the near future regardless of this action.
as long as the "moderate" palestinian faction provides cash incentives for terrorism, they clearly have no desire for peace (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palestinian_authority_martyrs_fund).
3. this isn't trump unilaterally making the decision, but rather the executive branch no longer using the excuse of security reasons to postpone compliance with us law.
in 1995 congress passed a law requiring the us move its embassy to jerusalem.
4. if there is ever a time to make this move with minimal consequences, it is now.
israel and palestine are completely overshadowed by the syrian war, sunni/shi'ite split, and saudi/iranian proxy conflicts.
5. it is imperative that the us not reward threats of violence by capitulating on this issue.
this reinforces negative behavior and legitimizes terrorism as a political tool.
6. trump is still an idiot and likely a crook, but that doesn't mean everything he does as president is wrong.
dae trump literally can't read and can't ever make his own decisions.
guarantee you if it was hillary it'd be a "strong and bold move for the sovereignty of u.s.
allies."
nah, even if it was hillary it would still be an incredibly dumb move.
for all that it will be good for the us arms industry, as arms sales to the region will rise rapidly.
when tyrants like putin and erdogan are criticising you for being too heavy-handed, you know you've seriously fucked up.
edit: yes, i get that they are criticising him because his move interferes with their plans.
still doesn't change the fact that trump's decision has caused nothing but lots of unnecessary tension.
and putin and erdogan are using it to make him look even worse.
trump got played.
or you know that the power in the area shifted away from them and they don't like it.
well considering even extremely lobbied canada thinks this is a terrible idea...i think it's the usa that is alone no, i don't believe that's how the situation is being assessed by anyone.
where are you even getting that idea from?
erdogan, putin say oppressive dictatorship will have positive impact on all: sources
i see a business opportunity here.
pakistan buys their air to air missiles from the us.
so build a bunch of really cheap drones (picture a v-1 with a camera instead of a warhead) and send them over a few a day.
then wait for the reorder on aim-120 amraam missiles at $1.7 million each.
sorry, we just order some cheap china anti-drone missiles.
you can also shoot down drones using machine guns sure, but how it the military industrial complex gong to make any money off of that?
you could, but it would also be difficult and expensive.
you know how much a 50 call round costs?
they're not cheap.
hitting a predator (or whatever our current class of drones are) sitting at 10000 ft with a machine gun isn't simple task.
um..fighter jets have guns they also cost a lot of fuel and ammo.
[operating costs](https://blogs-images.forbes.com/niallmccarthy/files/2016/08/20160815_fighters.jpg) the last claimed (e.g.
unverified) air to air kill with a gun or cannon was by an iranian pilot in 1981, at least from a quick search i did.
air to air combat is almost exclusively bvr (beyond visual range) using missiles these days.
upon further reading, there are some claims of air to air gun kills during desert storm, so early 90s, but even those are kind of dubious since afaik most of the iraqi air force was destroyed before they even got off the ground.
definitely some in desert storm: http://articles.latimes.com/1991-02-08/news/mn-937_1_air-combat and in the first venezuelan coup attempt a f16 engaged a ov10 with guns and brought it down.
that happened twice i believe, and that was in 92' does that include all the drones operating, presumably with the permission of the pakistani government, from all these bases within their territory?
https://gizmodo.com/5886642/these-are-all-the-us-drone-bases-in-pakistan america is going to regret trump so hard "hey, we paid for the right to invade your airspace!"
- us pakistan first?

(i'm a bot) ***** &gt; chief of pakistan air force air chief marshal sohail aman has said that the paf is been given orders to shoot down any drones, including those of the us, if they violate the country&amp;#039;s airspace.
&gt; the paf chief also informed the gathering that in the attack on kamra air base, terrorists managed to destroy one paf sab plane completely, and also inflicted considerable damage upon another.
&gt; paf has been at forefront in war against terrorism, says air marshal sohail aman.

i find it amusing how wrong you are... unlikely considering the fact that pakistan in military terms is very strong.
after a while you could probably destroy the paf though, but they are no pushover.
i mean their best aircraft is the f16.
you’re right that they’re no pushover, but we know any and every vulnerability their planes have, it wouldn’t be hard.
really?
are drones capable of engaging a fighter in air combat?
not even close and pak air force is no pushover.
drones that we are familiar with definitely couldn't they were built for precision ground strikes and reconnaissance.
as in drones that exist?
there a fuck load of different uav's.
&gt; the anti-poverty group [oxfam last week published its own blacklist](https://www.oxfam.org/en/shining-light-tax-havens-eu-cant-ignore), based on the same three criteria, but which included 35 non-eu countries and four eu countries not included on the eu’s list: ireland, malta, the netherlands and luxembourg.
&gt; twenty four jurisdictions have agreed to amend or abolish unfair or opaque tax regimes by 2018. these include aruba, cook islands, mauritius, seychelles and switzerland.
luxembourg is not on the list because it is made to list countries outside the eu this is the best tl;dr i could make, [original](https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/bermuda-luxembourg-new-eu-blacklist-omits-major-tax-havens/) reduced by 91%.

&gt; &amp;quot;the eu has today missed a great opportunity to tackle the real issues lying behind the large-scale tax avoidance and tax evasion that is bleeding eu countries dry,&amp;quot; said alex cobham, chief executive of the tax justice network.
&gt; &amp;quot;rather than have a list of tax havens based on an objective set of criteria, as originally envisaged, the list appears to be a political fix with eu members picking their least favourite countries to name and shame."

it would be silly for them to punish themselves.
it would be like the us saying "we are going after tax havens" and taking the state of delaware to court before any foreign countries.
because the taxes they end up losing hurt the eu as a whole a lot more?
everyday it seems that wall is for keeping people in the us not out i'd like to say to all those trump supporters: ahahahahahaha but... but... but... but... but... but trump promised!
id imagine there will be more jobs at a factory that produces cars that can be on the road today, vs a factory that will produce a driverless car with an uncertain regulatory future.
thanks ford.
mmga thanks, trump.
so a robotic car plant will build driverless vehicles.
doesn't this end with a terminator that looks a lot like arnold swargnegger saying i'll be back?
why even bother running.
he should just say "welp, i'm president.
for life.." my understanding is he's completely following the new rules that were put in place by medvedev and the russian duma, this allowed him to "legally" run again as president a term of 6 years (?)
and he gets another term of 6 years after that (if he wins).
after that he might have to have the laws changed again, or he retires, or becomes pm for a while, or dies... he'll become pm again, and have the new "president" change the laws so he can run again.
just like last time.
he does not even need to change the laws.
they do not have a limit.
only that you cannot run more than twice consecutively.
so one term for the puppet and then back for two terms again.
bingo.
this is why we will never see a new russia until putin is dead and his gang exiled or the law is changed.
putin and his gang came from nothing, he was a small time propaganda kgb agent in east berlin as were thousands of others.
all he did was cozy up to all the right people when he got into politics, to stop a putin from appearing again you have to get rid of basically every politician all the way to the local level and also get rid of all the elite.
one civil war coming up!!!!!
right after winter.... &gt; he was a small time propaganda kgb agent in east berlin kind of nitpicking, but it was actually [dresden](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32066222), in east germany.
we basically need to kill off the oligarchs worldwide.
our survival depends on it.
class war?
how does that work?
by seizing the means of production!
to china!!!
a communist revolution in china?
nah, it'd never happen.
or.. or.... **or**... just take up piracy in the pacific?
sink the cargo ships.
you win.
that's exactly what russia needs; a communist revolution!
/r/whatcouldgowrong how it works is that the [rich are waging a class war on the rest of us.
](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/rich-war-poor-world-columbia-university-professor-exploit-tax-resources-money-wealth-a8067621.html) the only question is whether we fight back, or accept neo-feudalism.
the modern world is venturing out into uncharted territory, which is "just murder the people who are posing the problem" is being seen as less and less of an answer to the public.
for instance, something tells me you're never going to see the american public "take up arms to fight tyranny" as the forefathers envisioned.
who gets to decide what that tyranny is?
how bad does it have to be that it warrants breaking the law and mass vigilantism?
no one is going to exercise it because we'll just see them as crazy terrorists.
i don't think we live in the same world as the one where the american or french revolutions were possible, you only see things like that modern day when the public is faced with *blatant* dictatorships.
the key difference is relative economic comfort.
for all the complaining we are no where near the poverty required to cause a civil war or uprising against the state.
until that happens we will put up with anything.
we are a country of people of new cars, quarter to half-million dollar houses for average people, the defining point of poverty is not being able to buy a house and have to rent, etc.
we are way too comfortable to sacrifice it all for a greater political good.
not in the west but there are plenty of people "living" in the 3rd world.
what's kept those people from revolting against their government?
nah we need 500 more years of imperialism russian here (who has read the russian constitution).
it says "not more than 2 times in a row".
and this statement was written in 1991 and never changed.
it's ambiguous - you can regard it as "2 times in a row and after a break you can go again" or "2 times in a row in whole lifetime".
what was changed when medvedev was a president: duration of presidency was increased from 4 years to 6. so "2 times in a row" now is 12 years in russia.
why not just get rid of term limits?
it's easier to pretend it's a democracy.
democracies afford a level of justification.
remove that and you make it obvious to people that you're only in power because you consolidated power.
in your moment of weakness they'll tear you apart.
this gives one more layer of contentment and helps you gain some power among "voters."
it also forces the opponents jump through a series of difficult hurdles, so they rarely reach the stage where they are enough of a threat to require more direct suppression.
and if they look like they might become a threat, you can just have them killed literally blocks from the kremlin.
yes, but that's messy and destabilizing if you do it too much.
it's saved for sending a message to the victim's allies that they're getting too loud.
the idea behind putin's system is he doesn't need to run an expensive police state forcing everyone into uniformity.
he gives his people room to breathe and gets them to help carry out his goals.
he allows some opposition activity so it doesn't build up in secret and explode.
it frees him up to play more international politics with russia's wealth.
it's also very much in keeping with the new style of autocrat that has arisen in the last few decades.
part of what's happening is related to how much easier it's become to control and manipulate information consumption.
in the old days an autocrat held power (this is still true in north korea) because defiance meant death or even worse.
the new style is to actually brainwash the masses into being on your side, which is much easier when you wear the facade of democracy and claim that the western powers are out to get you.
putin is obviously the prime example, but duterto, orban and a handful of others --arguably including trump-- are aspirants to his model.
democracy?
of course, comrade.
*moments later* i am president now.
no democracy.
is trick.
i love democracy.
-darth sidious wasn’t that senator palpatine who said that?
always two there are.
i am the house.
no, it was sheev.
well, if you're a galactic citizen of the ~~republic~~ empire, then yes.
yes, he did.
believe it was t h e s e n a t e i don't remember who it was, but i remember someone once said that if putin became a girl scout troop leader that that would suddenly become the highest office in russia.
bingo if only they has a true democracy where they get to pick between two corrupt billionaires.
"both parties are the same!
oh shit we're losing net neutrality.
i'm sure the presidency changing parties had nothing to do with that."
still better than that shit.
even ceaser augustus kept up the appearance of the republic.
but he wasn't fooling anybody by the end.
what smart dictators do is consolidate power legally and slowly, just like erdogan in turkey.
augustus was granted exceptional legalities by the senate, but then issued proscriptions to kill traitors, who were all coincidentally wealthy and opponents of him.
he kept the appearance of the republic, but everyone knew what he was doing; the difference is that he gave land for soldiers to conquer, food to the people, and wealth to the state.
he made rome flourish, and the people were generally ok since the civil wars were over and things were nice.
and was one of the few emperors not assassinated, executed or otherwise removed from the throne with violence.
tbh, he did let a lot of leeway to everybody.
i feel like he won't be around in 12 years.
there is already discontent amongst the oligarchs.
the sanctions have weakened there position and grown the small business sector though so they might play to putin's advantage by making appeasing them less necessary.
russia's economy is out of its recession though so who knows.
when he is removed from power we won't see it coming.
as was said of the soviet union, everything was forever until it was no more.
pretty much by definition, political tipping points cannot be predicted.
if they could be, they wouldn't be tipping points.
in some sense, his life must be horrifying.
he's on top of the pile and every day he's losing more and more grip.
his age, and the boldness of his opponents are an ever tightening noose around his neck.
and he deserves every ounce of fear from the impending doom.
if the people propping him up think they can get a better deal with someone else, they'll take it.
hey just successfully ran and continuing to run the most productive and successful psyops campaign in the history of the world.
he knows exactly what he's doing wouldn't describe it as losing his grip.
just following the play book https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics i'm not talking about his "accomplishments."
i'm stating that when you're a dictator you have to stay on top of everything.
once you begin to get tired or wane you are dead.
this is very true.
for a strongman to stay in power, he must never show a weakness that can be exploited to take him down.
history has shown us time and time again that weaknesses always expose themselves with time.
eventually one of his lackeys/collaborators will tire of taking orders, and seek that opening to become the new master.
russia relies on oil to fund its regions and keep them content.
unless oil prices go back up, russia will find it harder and harder to hold everything together.
maybe china will buy the far east for a trillion dollars lol you lose prestige for selling provinces he could balance that out by hiring an artist advisor... shit that was pussy riot wasn't it?
i feel like these rules are the calvin ball style of rules.
no, they're just very conveniently arranged for the one in power.
it's more like hobbes not letting calvin up into the treehouse until he sings the gross anthem to prove he's a member, and it happens to be about how awesome tigers are.
&gt;my understanding is he's completely following the new rules that were put in place by medvedev and the russian duma, this allowed him to "legally" run again as president a term of 6 years (?)
and he gets another term of 6 years after that (if he wins).
the new rules changed the term of 4 years into 6. by russian constitution you can only be elected for two consequential terms.
&gt; by russian constitution you can only be elected for two consequential terms.
but you (i.e.
putin) can be elected for an indefinite amount of two consequential terms if someone (i.e.
medvedev) takes your place in between.
yes, however it is not completely how it was intended by the drafters.
from all the commentaries of law professors i studied on the matter, the intent was to make a political comeback a possibility, not to abuse the article in xx-y-xx fashion.
if the opportunity for abuse of power exists, it will be used.
but this was done during the time that medvedev was putin's puppet... which strongly points to the intent by some at least being to make a political comeback a foregone conclusion of the xx-y-xx-z-xx-a-xx fashion.
"breaking news" then he cant say that its a democracy it's a bit of a stretch even with their 'elections' keeping up imagine is important in politics indeed.
i agree that that's why he does it.
just felt an irresistible urge to state the obvious :) according to my russian friends putin has overwhelming popular support from the populace.
a product of propaganda, but he doesn't need to rig the elections there putin: - imprisons/kill journalists and political opponents - stuffs ballot boxes - controls all media and still gets barley 60% in 2012.
"popular" indeed.
most dictators get 99% after doing all that yeah he's smarter than most other dictators and he can use that low % to say, "see?
if i were rigging it, would i only get that much?"
21st century oppression, you rig enough to win while still claiming it's free and fair.
well at least he tries to make it look realistic he gets 99% in chechnya, so here you go.
true.
i have heard that before.
my own uneducated guess is that with the propaganda machine putin has, he had complete control of the agenda.
this allows him to subtly prevent any direct opposition from gaining real traction.
the man seems to be really smart.
i'll give him that.
putin has an exit strategy for russian politics in the same way the us military does for afghanistan.
in that he doesn’t.
edit: spelling one of the russian trolls that frequents this sub told me he doesn't need an exit plan because the vast majority of the russian people love him.
now normally these people's lies are pretty easy to spot, but i got the distinct impression he was telling the truth on that one.
he is (i visit russia a lot).
people are more patriotic than us americans there and they are not loyal to their political party in the same way we are...part of it has to do with the president before him being a western "sellout" and a drunk.
which reminds me of a good joke which goes something like this: in a meeting between stalin and roosevelt, both were asking whose citizens were most patriotic and willing to die for their country.
both brought out one citizen of each country and provided the following order: jump off a large cliff.
roosevelt orders the us citizen to jump off the cliff.
the us citizen replies, "i can't, i have a wife and kid!".
stalin, amused, tells the soviet citizen to jump off the cliff.
the soviet citizen complies but before he does so, roosevelt stops him and says, "why are you jumping off the cliff?".
the soviet citizen replies, "i have to, i have a wife and kid!".
i like it too dark.
i love it.
a couple of years ago, when i was living in norway, i met a beautiful late 20s russian girl in an expat house party in oslo which was engaged to a canadian friend of a friend of mine.
she was very smart and educated, a chemical engineer in the norwegian o&amp;g industry, and very well travelled.
i thought, well, she is smart and educated so i'll ask her about putin to see what people like her really think about him.
she turned out to be a complete fan of him, and i mean like cult status.
she started ranting on how we "westerners" are completely brainwashed and that he really is a great leader and so on, etc.
it striked me (and the rest of the people in that conversation) as something very odd, we looked at each other uncomfortably, including her fiancé, and we just moved on to other subject.
from then on i realized that, if someone like her is a fan of putin, i can't even imagine how the average russian is... so, the mindset is - russia has no friends.
us is an enemy, europe is an enemy by proxy, china is an enemy with a reasonably secure cease-fire agrement in effect.
in that situation, russia can not allow itself to be taken lightly or taken advantage of.
it needs a strong leader who will secure the independence of the country from outside geopolitical attacks.
as long as he does his job of rebuting the west's attempts at bringing russia down, a lot can be forgiven.
the trick is - putin got initial good will boost simply by being the president at the time of oil price spike which improved the standard of living in russia.
add his past as a kgb agent, his judo, his fighter jet piloting, his whole persona of a strong capital m “man” and you get precisely the person an average russian bydlo desires.
all he has to do is protect his buddies' gas, oil and metal interests and that gets spinned as him standing up against the west.
she is the average russian.
*nationalistic if they were *patriotic*, people like putin would be hanged in the square.
agreed.
the people would be pissed that he's embezzled billions.
he only needs to invade ukraine and everyone can see him ride a horse and think they too are winning.
&gt; part of it has to do with the president before him being a western "sellout" and a drunk.
more like huge humanitarian and economic disaster that was the mostly us-engineered transition to capitalism after the collapse.
lots of big players in america got rich looting russia in the 90s.
there's a reason they hate us.
the life expectancy of russians *declined* as the free markets moved in.
i'm aware of one american business man that made a lot of money, which was then stolen back by putin.
all of the mafia oligarchs were russian/georgian/central european like who?
old people* not young.
it's important.
/i'm from russia/ realistically, putin is easily the best leader they've had for a very very long time, if not ever.
it's legitimately astounding just how bad russian leadership has been on average throughout history.
&gt; people are more patriotic patriotism is the best placebo when your country sucks.
okay, so you can brand me a troll if you want, but the reality on the ground in russia is that most people do love him.
also, i'm saying this as someone who went to school in uk, went to college in usa, and came back to russia.
would you say their love for him is based mostly on him taking down the oligarchs, taking crimea plus those other territories, 50/50, or something else entirely that i'm missing?
they/we (i'm personally ambivalent) love him for crimea, but we loved him before anyway.
he makes russia look strong on the world stage, a lot of older people who remember the height of the ussr respect him for that.
he makes the russian people feel better about themselves, and as a service to this good pr and good feelings, he eliminates all journalists who don't believe in this positivity.
so of course the people love him -- like little kim in north korea.
in a real government, people win by slim margins most of the time.
and half the people are perpetually pissed off.
have you ever talked to any actual russians, who you know don't have any reason to lie?
cause he is popular there.
it's only here in the usa that everyone seems to think it's some hostile dictatorship where everyone is terrified of him and secretly wishes he was gone.
eh, i lived in russia for several years.
opinions of him varied.
no one was 'terrified' of him really, no.
i'd say he was least popular in somewhere like st. petersburg.
overall i'd say he was popular in his initial run as he significantly reduced the day to day crime and improved the safety and security of life in russia.
then his popularity definitely was waning he did nothing about the day to day corruption (i think everyone accepts there will always be corruption on the top levels) and the oligarchy cemented it's status.
then his popularity has increased again with his recent international gamesmanship: perceived as making russia 'strong' again.
frankly the more he sets up america as an 'enemy' he's outwitting, the more that helps his popularity.
to add: crimea definitely helped his popularity - well before that happened your average russian - in my experience - considered crimea part of russia that was given away by khrushchev for no reason.
popularity and support are different things.
you can support 'lesser evil' when you beleive alternatives to be truly horrible (russain maidan, 1990th-like oligarchy etc).
yes, but then you get the whole issue of succession if he dies.
it's clear that russians support putin, but there's no preparation in the case of death.
i am willing to bet money his exit strategy is the same as yeltsin’s (and that is how he himself got in power): resign before your term ends and ensure that your protege wins.
the deal is that your protege does not come after you and your cronies (and putin did not go after the corrupt yeltsin family who plundered russia in the 90s).
yeah, the thing is though, putin could remain the most powerful person in russia even if he decided to retire right now.
any successor to putin will have very little choice but to be loyal to putin until his life ends naturally.
and even after that the public will probably expect a cardboard cutout replicating putin's policies... exactly.
the existing power structure is putin, you remove him and something needs to replace it root and branch joke unclear, do you mean he has a clear exit strategy and intends on executing it until he exits?
putin thanked his opponents, car accident, found dead in his home, polonium poisoning, shot in the street and mysteriously disappeared, for a well fought race.
you forgot suicide by shooting themselves in the back of the head twice.
he decided not to run again.
that guy's only rule was not to do anything twice.
he broke it once, and so he won't do it again.
and then putting themselves in a large black garbage bag then throwing themselves into a river.
i heard that’s the new fun trend.
very talented.
none of his opponents are a threat to putin's run.
sadly not even navalny, and even then they'll probably just not let him run for president anyway.
navalny is the only one who represents the actual opposition, most others(like zhirinovsky or zuganov) have been "running for president" for the last 20 years and are most likely on putin's payroll, some(yavlinsky) are basically a running gag in russian politics and just don't have a snowball's chance in hell in even getting past 5% of votes, and the last and most ridiculous one(sobchak) is basically a joke candidate added by putin(who met her before she announced that she'll be running for president) for lols(she's known for previously participating in paris hilton-like behavior) and "diversity"(will probably be the only actually big candidate who is also a woman).
this whole thing will be a farce again, don't expect any political assassinations, except for maybe navalny and/or some journalist who dug where he(or she) shouldn't have.
&gt; zhirinovsky oh, boy, and people think putin sucks.
and zuganov isn't much better than zhirinovsky i'm not sure i'd like navalny's foreign policy any more than putin's according to what i've read in the new york times.
i believe he used the words "shot like rats"?
zhirinovsky actually shares a lot of his playbook with trump.
he's made a really fruitful political career saying outrageous shit, appealing to the common russian man and "telling it like it is".
all while remaining loyal to the ruling party.
he's a court jester, basically.
&gt;and the last and most ridiculous one(sobchak) is basically a joke candidate added by putin(who met her before she announced that she'll be running for president) for lols(she's known for previously participating in paris hilton-like behavior) and "diversity"(will probably be the only actually big candidate who is also a woman).
you forgot to add that she is the daughter of anatoly sobchak, who was putin's professor at university and a mentor later on in life.
[here's putin crying at sobchak's funeral, the daughter's on the right.
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladimir_putin#/media/file:vladimir_putin_24_february_2000-2.jpg) &gt; navalny is the only one who represents the actual opposition does he?
in the most recent [levada](https://www.levada.ru/2017/12/04/vozmozhnye-rezultaty-prezidentskih-vyborov-4/) poll, only 1% of russians said they'd vote for navalny if elections were held that weekend.
that's less than would vote for zhirinovsky (4%) *and* zyuganov (3%).
of those who would definitely be voting, the numbers were 2% navalny, 4% zhirinovsky, 4% zyuganov.
unless you mean "actual opposition" as in "most likely to hold genuine views that are different from putin's", which is fair.
but he's just...not popular.
i posted this in another thread, but here's a basic rundown.
faq.
q - how is it possible for putin to be running for his 4th term?
a - in russia, there is no limit on how many terms you can serve - there's only a limit which states that you can serve two consecutive times.
what putin did, was that after his two terms as a president, he became a prime minister and then dmitry medvedev became a russian president for one term.
now medvedev is a prime minister and putin is the president.
──────── q - how long is the presidential term?
a - six years.
──────── q - will putin win the elections?
a - most certainly, his approval and his prime minister's rating are in high 70% - 80%, and there's no really other candidate in russia who could match putin.
──────── q - will it be his last term as a president?
a - possibly/most likely... he's 65 years old at the moment, and he will be 71-72 when his term finishes.
then he has to step down as a president so his next election would be when he is 77-78 years old :) ──────── q - when is the election?
a - 18th of march 2018, to coincide with the anniversary of russia annexing crimea.
──────── q - what about the opposition leader alexei navalny.
does he have a chance?
a - no, he doesn't stand a chance, and furthermore, his name most likely won't be allowed on the ballot as he has a criminal conviction.
──────── q - are you a russian spy?
a - нет.
he's 65?!
he looks 50. is great russian leader, does not age botox and plastic surgery.
yeah, there's a few websites detailing how his face has changed.
it's weird.
well?
link them.
don’t leave us hanging here!
sorry to hear about your broken fingers.
[it's mostly crap sites like this](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3042134/what-putin-face-russian-leader-vladimirs-appearance-changed-dramatically-years-looks-younger-ever.html) so i honestly kind of doubt it.
i guess people haven't heard of makeup at daily mail.
in russia, your looks make your age look old.
he disappeared from public view for a couple ~~months~~ weeks a few years ago and came back looking significantly younger.
could be plastic surgery, or one hell of a vacation.
it was like 11 days thanks, memory was a bit fuzzy, but i'm pretty sure you're right.
i edited.
&gt; q - what about the opposition leader alexei navalny.
does he have a chance?
&gt; a - no, he doesn't stand a chance, and furthermore, his name most likely won't be allowed on the ballot as he has a criminal conviction.
like a real criminal conviction or "criminal conviction" a few "convictions" and a few real ones.
putin will win with 96% of the vote, and only two dead competitors.
they chose 96% because it's more believable than 120%.
120% is more believable because people vote twice since he is the greatest.
that actually happened a few years ago btw.
putin won by such a margin, total votes calculated in the elected sumed up to over 120% of the voting population.
no corruption here at all.
can't believe we even entertain these people that are clearly just gangsters.
link?
sure, https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=451_1323095827 source from the russian news media some other sources: http://www.economist.com/node/21541455 https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/09/russia-putin-election-fraud/500867/ https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-election-fraud-exclusive/exclusive-at-a-russian-polling-station-phantom-voters-cast-ballots-for-the-tsar-iduskcn1bn15p &gt;there is a risk, say some observers, that mr putin will look for enemies outside the country or launch a war against liberal-minded civil society.
economist called it in 2011. damn, they hit the nail on the hammer.
now we have to wait for trump supporters saying the economist article from 2011 is fake news.
most of the russian people support him, even if he didn't cheat he would win by a long shot.
hmm if only there were some way to prove that... edit: while the discussion is all very interesting, i was really thinking the best way to prove the support would be through a free and open election process.
there is.
international election monitors.
osce is present on every elections.
http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/russia2012 [in 1927, charles king won the presidential election in liberia with 243,000 votes.
there were only 15,000 registered voters!
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberian_general_election,_1927) even if he loses he'll still win.
his competition will gracefully exit out a window.
after they shot, stabbed or poisoned themselves &gt;after they shot, stabbed **and** poisoned themselves ftfy (probably not in that order) who is he running against, rasputin?
in other news, sky blue, grass green.
in tomorrow's news, putin "wins" election in landslide... oh gee, i wonder if he'd win what a complete surprise for all russians!
/s i'm not surprised.
dictators rarely willingly give up their power.
yes, but now with the increase work load of running both russia and the us, i would assume he would chose just one.
new hire just isn’t cutting it.
russian ballot: [ ] putin [ ] polonium can i ask my american comrades to rig our election like we did with yours?
i won’t survive 6 more years in isolation with north korea 😩 we can't even figure out how to get a pedophile to lose the alabama senate race, good luck getting us to rig russia's election.
oh but you can rig elections you only got the agenda wrong.
the gop and fox news is already hard at work rigging the election in favor of the aforementioned pedophile.
[already did that once, hope you enjoyed your drunk incompetent fool, fam.
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_presidential_election,_1996) really want to ask for another one?
be careful what you wish for.
they are trying that since the 50ies in every election, and they got lucky with their candidate, yeltsin, once already.
i work with a lot of very nice russian people (in london) and we get on very well.
it's only when we come to talk about putin that i feel a massive cultural difference.
one particularly intelligent and sensitive woman told me, with a straight face, that he is incredibly attractive.
i asked about the barechested horseriding type pics and she was completely baffled by my smile and barely suppressed laughter.
"he is a real man" she patiently tried to explain.
we were both equally at a loss to understand each other's view.
"a real man" ("настоящий мужчина") while translated literally like that, has a meaning that has been sort of suppressed in the western world.
with equal rights and all that it's akin saying "women belong in the kitchen" nowadays, definition of a "real man" has blurred.
i mean a man that stays at home and looks after kids is still a "real man" in the west.
in russia it still has that "old" meaning and it's a dream for a woman to find a "real man" that will take all the burden on his shoulders, can protect himself and the family, will be the main earner etc etc.
it especially applies to people born before 90s.
i am not taking any sides here and am generalising, just that being multi cultural i understand why russian ladies find him appealing.
you would also find a lot of russian women think completely opposite.
and a lot of western women who would think the same, they're just not journalists so you rarely hear their opinions.
no, that's what it means in english, too.
putin will die in office, russia doesn't have a democracy its run by a bunch of gangsters.. what you say, fren?
come outside for second i want understand you correctly.
no leave coat.
putin cannot retire even if he wants to.
the moment he retires, two bullets will find him in the back of his head courtesy of all the people he fucked while in power.
just like mafia heads cannot really "retire."
thug for life is not just a saying.
i honestly don't get this argument.
why can't putin do what yeltsin did in 1999 and peacefully transfer power to a new friendly leader?
when yeltsin passed the reigns to putin, he made sure that his "family" would be safe.
yeltsin was very corrupt and genuinely despised by a lot of people, yet he remained safe and far away from the politics in the 2000s until he died peacefully due to his horrible alcoholism.
putin can find some strongman more or less respected by the public like shoygu to act as the "new, capable leader", who would keep the oligarchs at the distance and let putin get away from the politics safely.
i personally don't believe that putin currently has an "escape plan", hence why he goes for the fourth term, but it's not unrealistic.
&gt; why can't putin do what yeltsin did in 1999 and peacefully transfer power to a new friendly leader?
b/c putin is the russian government.
his connections are everywhere, if he walks away there is no one to protect them anymore.
he can, when he is physically incapable to.
he can walk away at any moment and nobody will dare stop him.
he just doesnt want to, for now &gt; the moment he retires, two bullets will find him in the back of his head courtesy of all the people he fucked while in power.
uh, when was the last time a former russian head of state was assassinated?
it isn't a smart move because it means you are next.
he should just stop this masquerade and proclaim himself tsar.
insisting on holding elections is just playing people for fools.
tsar vladmir iv does have a certain ring to it.
why bother with an election at all?
we all know putin will remain president until he dies or is killed.
it's democratic to have a fake election with stuffed ballots.
where are the air quotes?
i think the "run again" should have air quotes.
otherwise, it implies they're is a competition and a chance he could be voted out.
i, too, would support a dictator if my country was shit /s in all seriousness, the russian federation has such severe domestic problems that the only way for putin to maintain his collapsing state is to pick on the neighbors.
disgruntled citizens are easily distracted by military "achievements".
you know, for the motherland.
100 bucks says he wins "run" implies that there will be opposition that won't end up falling down elevator shafts onto some bullets.
not really surprising to see him run yet again; the timing is funny—he must've wanted to deflect attention at the embarrassing ban from the olympics yesterday.
i wonder what methods of cheating he'll use this time?
in 2012, there was an unprecedented amount of evidence showing ballot-stuffing, pre-filled bins, erasable ink in poll stations, and so on.
putin, the man who brought back the soviet-era anthem, is a lying deceitful mafioso paranoid megalomaniac.
it really is par for the course for putin.
a consistently predictable pattern of corruption.
coincidence and controversy abounds around this sadistic ego-tripping scapegoating denialist.
a modern stalin no better than the spoiled puppet dictator assad he protects.
- involvement in their missiles downing the civilian airliner mh17?
deny.
have state-run media conduct internal investigation.
big surprise it absolves them of blame despite dutch independent investigation report pointing the blame wholly on russia.
- denial and scapegoating of links in the panama papers.
- involvement in the coup on parliament with yeltsin.
- involvement in the stolen money that was supposed to feed the starving in st. petersburg - convenience/coincidence surrounding the assassination of opposition leader growing momentum against putin.
- convenience/coincidence of russian apartment bombings that just so happened to help putin rise in popularity.
- blatant lying regarding troops in ukraine - blatant lying and denial of involvement with the assassination of russian fsb agent, alexander litvinenko (largest most expensive investigation in scotland yard's history pointing the finger at russia and specifically putin).
- numerous journalists who were critical of putin murdered.
- blatant lying about directing cyber-attacks in america.
- blatant lying about directing the doping scandal (that led to the embarrassment of being banned from future olympic events) **it really makes me wonder why putin who purports himself to be such a strong leader is too cowardly to be upfront with his actions**.
appealing to fear and *using* fear as intimidation and leverage is commonplace and well-documented.
it's an oligarchy with a mafioso crime boss at its head.
this is not a conspiracy, this is evidence that continues to mound.

[here's the 6 minute trailer](https://youtu.be/euyrdjupbvu).
it doesn't just focus on russia, but uses them as a case-study for the thesis.

as seen in, "inside putin's russia."
[from russia, with hate](https://vimeo.com/55633560) - doc from 2007 highlighting far-right extremists in russia and getting a little too close for comfort.
the russian state is ranked poorly on government transparency, on corruption, and on safety for journalists.
are you fine with putin becoming the president of russia for the 4th time?
[ ] i am totally fine with this [ ] i do not mind at all how is this even news?
this should be olds.
fuck.
dudes immortal.
take his head for his power.
her we are born to be princes of the universe!!
yeah.
he's gonna "run" for president.
so is this where the cia begins their information cyber warfare?
how do you guys think the participation will be this time?
130%, 150% ?
at what point does he just drop the pretense and name himself czar, emperor, glorious leader for life, or whatever the fuck?
alternate title: "russian president-for-life intends to keep doing job" also in the headlines: "putin critics mysteriously vanish ahead of vote" "top russian journalist falls on 12 bullets down stairs after criticizing putin run for re-election" he's long passed the point where he can remain alive and not be the president of russia.
**authoritarian regimes rarely cede power readily putin is a perfect example of machiavelli put in practice.
he's the tywin lannister of russia.
people might not love him or like him but they respect him because he's not a complete buffoon unlike some other country's president.
just like george rr martin stated in an interview history has shown that a good man doesn't necessarily translates to a good king.
considering all the rampant criminal organizations and corruption in russia it's no wonder they want a strong effective leader to represent them.
my biggest impression of putin was when chechen rebels took over a theater in moscow with 850 hostages.
these rebels knew they were going to die no matter the outcome but wanted to use leverage of the civilians to gain independence from russia.
instead of thinking about popularity polls or how it'll affect his career putin ordered his spetsnaz to storm the building and deemed the 170 casualties as acceptable collateral damage.
no fancy hollywood action hero esque negoations tactics, just straight to the point butchery.
now i'm not saying this was the "right" decision with all those lives lost but in a time when russia was unstable and every region in their union bitching to get out he established his dominance.
nobody tried to test putin since because they know he doesn't fuck around.
fantastic!
i was 5 when he become the president and i will be what, 28 when this term is over?
he stole the best years of my life, literally.
we have a saying in my home country.
god in heaven, putin on earth.
can somebody explain to me how organising protests lands you with an embezzlement charge?
it's obviously bullshit but i'd like to see the reasoning of the courts, if they provided any.
what, being president of the usa isn't enough for putin?
maybe america will interfere with and rig the outcome of their election!!
hur hur.... “run” for “president.”
way to be reasonable, understanding, knowing your role in society, and standing up for the people, good luck.
almost brings a tear to my eyes, hearing police stand with the people, in a scary, stabby country luke honduras.
that's just the tear gas.
don't worry, it will pass.
and, as a bonus, your sinuses will all drain.
as an aside, does cs gas smell vaguely of pinesol to anyone else?
that's enough trips into the chamber for you... i’m in honduras at the moment.
the police didn’t do anything because they didn’t get the christmas bonus they were promised.
the president paid them yesterday and now they are out in force.
not fun.
well that sucks.
figures it would have been about money.
stay safe.
this whole thread is pure reddit stupidity.
everyone is clapping about the courageous cops but turns out it was completely different.
fuck.
so much for that beautiful moment.
-_- so...do the police acknowledge they're the only thing standing between the people and a government of their choosing?
el presidente quickly realized how important it is to keep morale high.
/r/ruinedwholesomereddit please up vote this.
this was all about money.
the media here (in honduras) only covers the "good" news.
here's an article about the police back at work stopping some guys who were making shots after curfew (probably as sign of protest).
please understand that owning a gun is not a big deal here.
http://www.laprensa.hn/sucesos/1132459-410/capturan-cuatro-hombres-armas-camionetas-honduras-san_pedro_sula- people all around the country have been banging on pans, lighting fireworks, as well as firing guns into the air.
honestly i'd go through the gas chamber no mask right now.
theres nothing like getting your sinuses cleansed that hard, that fast.
who the hell are you, and how many times have you been through the gas hut.
you must be this [guy](https://terminallance.com/2015/11/20/terminal-lance-405-gas-gas-gas/) brilliant last line kinda ruins it though, should've been more subtle like: "i didn't know our cbrn chief warrant officer was missing an arm."
"...he isn't..." subtlety isn't really a thing marines would get... i’m an 0351 terminal lance.
i love that guy!!
have you heard his podcast?
they were on a break for a couple of weeks, but combine him and duffelblog (paul szoldra) and it’s absolutely epic.
eh, yearly gas chamber is a joke.
i can't say i miss the boot camp gas chamber, but god damn was it fun to see who would freak the hell out.
seriously.
why don't they do the gas chamber at the start so everyone can run so much easier with clear passages?
because it's more fun to do it after chow.
as a civvie, i'm guessing you say that because you're not the one cleaning up after the exercise?
i volunteered to go through again at boot camp and they denied me the pleasure.
i was in great lakes in the old ships in july, no ac, windows open.
they were demolishing a building on the other side of the road and we had to wipe away visible layers of dust 3 times a day.
my sinuses stayed so packed i couldn't eat without severe pain.
eventually i somehow figured out how to get a large supply of sudaphed, the real stuff, and popped out like candy the rest of boot camp i think you mean great mistakes.
there was one guy in my basic company that the cs gas didn't affect.
he got some redness in his eyes and a small cough.
drill sergeants had him doing side straddle hops in there.
it was bizarre.
it has a very unique peppery spicy smell to me.
i like the residual smell months after that remains on my body armor to me, it had an almost sharp and abrasive semi-cedar smell.
i can still experience it when i close my eyes.
i remember taking off my mask and inhaling very deeply... because i was nervous... and stupid.
but i didn't panic!
so there's that at least.
luke honduras sounds like a south american gangster from a pulp detective story.
i will never live this down.
i will leave the post as is.
and spend my weekends in cheap hotels, drinking cheaper whiskey.
and try solving the murder of that hooker's friend.
the gaunt, ashy-faced little man's lips formed a razor-sharp, bemused smile, his pencil-thin moustache warping itself into a faint "m" to accomodate this increasingly rare and altogether brief event, as his left hand deftly plucked the unfiltered cigarette out of his mouth as one would a musical instrument, holding it between long- and ringfinger like a totem pointing to the ceiling, the only thing shielding us from the heavy april rains, in the upstairs office of *"salope du jour"*.
the fabric of his pin-striped suit sighed lazily as he crossed his legs, and those grey, jaundiced, lifeless eyes, like two pissholes in snow, held my gaze; *"is that a 'yes'...?".
* the giant honduran man's hands firmed up slightly around my shoulders, at hearing the words.
i was sweating bullets.
it was the best beer i'd had in a long time, ice cold with flecks of foam that tickled my upper lip.
i downed it and ordered another.
i saw the looks of approval from the regulars, though i was still regarded with suspicion.
good drinking bars rarely take kindly to strangers, straight off.
i might have to put a few kinks in my own liver, to get any information here.
this is not the honduras you are looking for.
careful, you might run into bill o'reilly.
luke honduras sounds like a mediocre edm dj from miami.
i have friends who live outside of tegucigalpa and i visited for a few weeks.
from what i saw personally and the stories i hear i can't believe a honduran cop said it.
that's pretty crazy.
they are often corrupt and violent.
i was told by the people i know who live their to carry spare cash in a pocket in case a cop tries to extort a bribe out of me.
like that blew me away that it's so common they just prepare for it.
it's shocking to hear a honduran cop be so honest and real like this but it is awesome too!
i met an ex-mexican cop who said he quit right away, moved to the states, when his boss told him, "this is what you will be making, the rest is up to you."
this is pretty much it.
police in central america are paid in power instead of money.
they live off of the tips.
being asked to turn on your fellow citizen instead of just accepting protection money is a totally different kettle of fish.
my dad is mexican and when he went to visit mexico, he was kidnapped and robbed, by the police.
they took him to some rural area and pointed a gun to his head and told him if he didn't pay up he was going to die.
motherfuckers.
from other comments it looks like they join protest cause they weren't getting paid enough.
that's what i've heard from family down there too.
they are just trying to renegotiate thier contract.
which really just makes this whole reddit circlejerk over them all the more stupid.
you're describing almost every latin american cop.
fun fact: i work in book translation.
the brazilian book market is filled with escapist fiction, especially thrillers, but the one kind of book that's hard to sell there is crime thrillers where the protagonist is a cop.
they don't do well since many people don't see cops as sympathetic figures because they're so corrupt.
that is fascinating.
would expect the same is true for film and television?
i have no idea!
but it wouldn't surprise me.
trends in general tend to carry over to other mediums.
there's a brazilian movie called "tropa de elite".
it's about the special forces of the military police.
main character is the same guy who plays escobar on "narcos".
i personally liked it.
very much so.
of your friend's story, i heard similar ones in indonesia.
man is a crazy animal.
wife was there doing research.
they made friends with a local, who wouldn't go out at night and wouldn't let them go out at night.
several times she couldn't work because the university was taken over by protesters.
for as much time as she spends in central america, honduras sounds the scariest.
costa rica, guatemala, belize, panama i hear are a lot more safe.
honduras and el salvador though can be pretty sketchy.
its because they were negotiation with the government.
they just wanted their bonuses, it was a way to pressure them into paying sooner.
pretty awesome and uplifting stuff...we need more :) "i am luke honduras, jedi, like my father before me."
if only the scary, stabby, gun loving land of liberty had police of such noble caliber.
you used the word "caliber" on purpose, *didn't you*?
which caliber is the noblest?
[my favorite sobering video...] (https://youtu.be/ssln6rqcgrs) that guy can be my police chief damn.
luke honduras is the name of the next character i make in whatever game i play next.
hey man, that would bring a tear to my eye anywhere.
honduras, i am your father!
no,i am your father.
this is the first time i’ve ever seen a comment with a spelling error upvoted hard, nice work i follow your sentiment america is also scary and stabby only less visible.
my 19 year old son is living there now.
i hope that honduras becomes stable again soon.
for honduran people's sake and the safety of my son.
i agree and hopefully your son comes through this safely.
noooo, this has a lot more to do with them standing down over pay issues instead of respecting the ppl.
there's a lot more to this story than everyone here believes...the police have incentives as well.
http://www.nydailynews.com/newswires/news/world/honduran-opposition-rejects-president-lead-tally-article-1.3676201 or just using it as pressure point to increase their salary https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7hxym4/we_dont_want_to_repress_police_in_honduras_refuse/dqupnzv hijacking for visibility.
for those interested on knowing what is going on in honduras.
extremely long story short: our current president ran for reelection, something that is prohibited by article 239 of our constitution.
however this article was deemed "illegal" in 2015 by the supreme court which had recently experienced a soft coup when our president kicked out 5 magistrates and replaced them with personal friends of his.
now fast forward to sunday 26th of november when hondurans went to the ballots and voted against this illegal reelection.
the opposition leader was in the lead by 5% with about 60% of the ballots counted.
this trend was deemed irreversible.
however the next day the system used for counting the votes went offline for 10 hours and when it came back online the current president was now up by 1 point.
this caused massive outrage and people took to the streets in protest.
most of these were peaceful however there were opportunists in some cities who started looting, this included member of the national police force.
this lead to the president suspending constitutional grants and establishing a curfew.
this also put into effect an "anti-terrorism" law which in summary grants the military police to shoot first and ask questions later.
in the past week there has been 11 dead and several others injured.
thanks for insights.
it seems like some dictatorship power struggles are hard to die.
i'm sure they'll enjoy the feeling right up into they're killed or imprisoned for disobeying orders &gt; standing up for the people, good luck.
the people who are protesting narrowly lost the election, and then lost the recount too.
the title here is ridiculous and untrue.
these are *anti-democracy* protests, if anything.
that moment when police in honduras seem to have more standards than the police in the usa.
smh.
i know this is a joke, but as a native from san pedro sula who came to the us at 16 years of age you'd have to be absolutely out of your mind if you really think the police and security in general in honduras is even remotely close to the standard that we have here in most parts of the us.
i for one, don't entertain the idea of being shot or stabbed in the back because someone saw me walking around with an iphone 4 and wants it for himself.
uhhhhhh honduras is so much more dangerous than the us in honduras we have a curfew from 8pm to 6am since last friday.
the first couple of days the police had confrontations with the people, but like the article reads, on monday they decided not to confront the people but this decision comes mostly as a protest for their low salary ($424) and tough access to house loans.
so basically, they would be ok with busting heads if they were paid better?
kinda seems less heroic.
pretty much.
well if you are gonna repress people, you have to pay the people doing the repressing enough to feel that they don't have anything in common with the repressed, and have everything to lose for not repressing them.
source: history of people being asshats.
i know a certain trigger happy police force that clearly needs paid less... i thought u.s. police get paid shit &gt; the bjs says.
the median annual wage earned by police officers as of 2011 was $54,230 you also have to consider they get medical and a pension.
it's not that bad all in.
i mean, how bad can it be: http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/14/nyregion/most-police-officers-retire-after-20-years-or-move-up-the-ranks.html pensions are on their way out for a lot of forces though, and the payscales aren't as nice.
it's not as gravy as it once was, the guys that are retiring right now though, like in their 50's have it fucking made, their the ones that will be rolling in it while they are retired.
a lot of the new officers coming in right now across the country won't be looking at nearly as much money in their future so don't think its some fucking cakewalk, and once again know that it's the babyboomers in this sector that are living the good life.
well at least you'll be glad to know that pensions are becoming obsolete in every profession [and in the us its being contributed for the state of the economy recently.
](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/04/23/pensions-economy-workers/83292892/) good.
our police force should be paid for the role they fill.
which for a looooonnggg time has not been what the average taxpayer wants.
the fact that cops spend a giant amount of time enforcing speeding laws and seizing any illicit cash they can says a lot.
if they truly matured into a fair, honest, protection based force, and gained that reputation, the public would happily fund pay raises and pensions.
keep cutting and you end up with more crooked cops, and eventually noncompliant forces like in honduras.
masters need to at least upkeep their slave patrol.
canadian median salary for police officers is closer to 6 figures i think.
that's how it should be honestly.
you don't want your police officers accepting bribes... trust me it's not a complaint.
but i believe canada's police are amongst the best paid in the world.
higher pay alone doesn't stop bribes and extortion.
you need higher pay combined with a cultire of integrity and following the law and commissions to investigate corruption.
also higher pay desnt stop government police repression.
if anything it enables it.
6 dollars!
ha.
i laugh at your health care, well paid teachers, and lack of mass gun violence.
great, i made my self sad.
my aunt retired about 10 years ago at 40 and had kids and gets a fat fucking pension, like a 6 figure pension.
gets to raise her kids very hands on, only thing is she came out of the nypd fucking insane eh it's pretty bad.
most ems is.
police get pretty decent benefits though.
and access to power to be corrupt or do good.
depends on the person that's the basic rule of staying in power.
pay your police/military/civic guard well.
or give them lots of opportunities for graft.
same difference.
that’s how it works though.
once tyrants can’t afford their armies the people win.
you'd be surprised what people would do for a full tummy and nice place to live.
[removed] [removed] you can also see that they are not content with the government doing reprehensible acts at a reasonable price.
striking is truly ingrained into their culture.
in 2010, students across the country lost 60 days because of the teachers strike.
in 2009 they lost 100 days.
when you have so little and are depended on so much, it's only natural to stand on that leg if you have ground.
is like most people are any different tho.
i bet that with enough money everyone can turn into a "psychopath" for an extra $25us and 2.5 points on the back, i'll get real clubby for you, senor.
señor.
alt+0241 :d very useful one to know thanks düde!
&gt; thañks type ~, then n. ñ. although i guess your keyboard might not have a tilde key.
~n doesn't work for me.
that's how the us international keyboard layout does it.
if you just have us english it won't work.
it's hard to say which motive "mostly" affected their actions.
hurting the innocent takes a toll on people, they know they are unjustified and have no right to be there bullying the people, they get constant (justified) hate, and it's exhausting, mentally, emotionally and physically.
i feel like the fact they they don't get paid enough is the straw the broke the camels back.
anyway, i like to believe there are heroes in the ranks.
trust me, in moments like these, i would like to believe that as well.
thats what honduran newspapers report to cover it up and pretend that the reason is only money.
this is the best tl;dr i could make, [original](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2017/12/05/we-dont-want-repress-police-honduras-refuse-orders-stamp-out-pro-democracy-protests) reduced by 86%.
(i'm a bot) ***** &gt; amid widening violence and ongoing protests, members of the honduras national police force-including those within the u.s.-trained units known as the cobras-say they are refusing to obey orders from the right-wing government of the incumbent president, juan orlando hern&amp;aacute;ndez, who has used the security forces to crackdown on demonstrators and imposed a curfew amid allegations of voter fraud in recent elections.
&gt; &amp;quot;we want peace, and we will not follow government orders - we&amp;#039;re tired of this,&amp;quot; a spokesperson for the police told reporters outside the national police headquarters on monday.
&gt; a honduras police officer said on the local television network, une, that some officers will go on a hunger strike as they are tired of taking orders from corrupt politicians to go after innocent people, adding that they aren&amp;#039;t machines and are tired of seeing people&amp;#039;s blood spill.

saying “no” to the western district way.
just say no.
wow, this is really interesting!
wait good and not stupid news?
i guess source name checks out.
it's not good news that hondurans are even in this situation... r/good_cop_free_donut meanwhile, in the home of the free, anyone who do disturbs arizona's public peace may soon be subject to civil asset forfeiture.
forfeiture that basically goes directly to top prosecutor pockets, like how they discovered in new york, drawing out over 3m from forfeitures as bonuses.
r/bad_cop_no_donut /r/stopresisting the prosecutors and cops split it.
i went on an all expense paid "team building mission" in hawaii funded solely by forfeiture money.
way to make you all culpable.
im sure you tried to refuse!
like you would.
just the way rich people want it.
i know a couple of gardening tools that will fix that ☭.
what the fuck kind of gardening are you doing that you need a hammer?
the sickle is also kind of confusing, but maybe you have a weed problem or something and you like aggressive solutions.
but a hammer?
building a planter, shoring up some landscaping, driving in the pins into the ground for landscaping fabric or sprinkler heads.
do you even garden bro?
no.
i hate gardening and anything that even kind of resembles it, personally.
my ideal lawn is a bunch of rocks.
but you must paint them green maybe they live in rocky soil?
although i would pick a pick, a large enough hammer does work.
like in siberia, russia will pay you to live there and farm, but a lot of the land is fields of large boulders.
needs blasting and smashing.
i've driven fence posts with a hammer.
not ideal, but it'll do in a pinch.
it's worked so well so far last i heard that bill was dead.
for the love of [george](http://www.reddit.com/r/the_george) i hope so.
thank you for this.
yeah that’s fucked i get the joke but at least here it's illegal for politicians to physically oppress political protests.
i thought a bill was passed that [did the opposite](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/arizona/articles/2017-04-12/ducey-signs-bill-tightening-laws-on-civil-asset-forfeitures).
or is there another worse one now?
/r/stopresisting i'm guessing the cia didn't anticipate humanity intervening in their plans.
pay them more generous wages and you'll see that "humanity" disappear very quickly.
police in latin american countries (esp.
brazil) make the power-abusing ones in the us look like peaceful hippies with how trigger happy and corrupt they are.
third world country citizen here.
the brutality i've seen from certain cops in the us is more akin to our paramilitary groups (those guys armed to the teeth outside the law) and mobsters than cops.
some cops may be dirty, but rarely do you see one murder anyone they think is "a thug" in cold blood and get away with it.
it seems to me like a dirty cop in honduras would be more than glad to take a bribe and look the other way, they got more important shit to deal with.
in the us they would probably beat you down for trying to bribe them then civil forfeiture all your shit including your car after sprinkling some crack on you because they are safe in court.
"civil forfeiture your shit"...lol the fact that you think that last sentence is even remotely accurate is ridiculous.
there's no need to " beat them down " or " sprinkle some crack on you " when they can just charge them with bribery which is a felony.
yeah but then they can't seize your car and assets as easily.
plus they can still use the bribery charge on top of the rest.
unfortunately data trumps your anecdote.
i'm also talking about certain **latin american** police forces btw.
similar to your experience, in india (where i'm from), cops get bribes but rarely shoot at civilians.
they prefer to beat you with lathis (sticks).
however, [in latin america](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brazil-police-violence-madonna-rio_us_59f9dc68e4b0d1cf6e91f1ef) &gt;brazil suffered 61,600 homicides in 2016, according to a new analysis of federal data released on monday.
and as violent crime continues to plague the country, brazilian police forces are becoming increasingly lethal at an even faster rate.
&gt;brazilian police killed 4,224 people in 2016, 26 percent more than in 2015, according to the 11th annual brazilian yearbook of public security.
(the numbers were first reported by globo news.)
the number of total homicides, by contrast, rose 3.8 percent.
&gt;by comparison, there were roughly 17,000 homicides in the united states in 2016. police shot and killed at least 963 people, according to the washington post’s database on police shootings.
the u.s. population outnumbers the brazilian population by about 110 million people.
hang on a minute, we're talking about murder, not just all shootings.
and given that brazil has more violent crime than the us, it would make sense that brazilian police end up shooting more people than us police.
the question is the rate at which those shootings are justified.
you said "police in latin american countries".
brazil is only one of many latin american countries.
refer to it as "brazil".
we don't lump canada with the us.
it happens so infrequently, can't blame them.
one great advantage of having minimal competence at the u.s. state department is that we can -finally- stop sending right wing death squads against latin american socialists.
seriously, that's been uncle sam's modus operandi going back to even before st. reagan made us a proper ownership society.
wishful thinking.
we are decimating the state dept.
not the cia.
the death squad lovers are still fully supported well trump wants to hire his own private police force.
one that has been accused of murder in other countries.
i suspect he wants to avoid having the police refuse to bash some skulls when the next mass protest happens.
honduran here, the current president participated in the elections through an illegal re-election process, using the supreme court controlled by him, since we have no independence among the powers of the state, the fraud situation was something i expected, but something that people no longer want to tolerate and that is why we are having massive protests, family members of different parties, race, social status are joining in this events and that's why the police is standing with the people because they don't want to repress this movement just to defend someone who is not popular, who is found the things in am undemocratic way, sorry for my english thanks for breaking it down.
ok that's a good start, let's see if the military says the same.
in my country police is persecuting and killing "indians" because they see them as "terrorists", are backed up by the local government trying to incriminate all the originary peoples movements, all of them in one go, for the actions of a few that they can't prove are really who them say they are, and making all the other originary peoples suffer the same discrimination, just for protesting for things like the big conglomerates exploiting the national resources, leaving wastes lands and taking everything out of the country, without taxes, and reclaiming the land that should belong to them... seems like they are not people in their eyes... we have a long way to go :( that doesn't sound like the honduran police at all.
usually they're like lets go drinking with our m16s and then get drunk and point them at people.
the two are not exactly exclusive.
they're mostly doing it because they want a higher salary.
how long until the soldiers start killing cops?
i sense a new police force being hired soon!
they're not getting paid enough.
thats the only reason.
this is pr.
the real threat to oppressive regimes is not the protester, but the man who refuses to hurt or kill him.
like the tank driver in that famous tianmen square vid.
when the tank driver can roll over the guy, no questions asked, you can succeed at repression but there is morality within us waiting to be lit by a spark of rebellion.
as russian, i'm so envious it’s about time.
now hopefully they might be able to drive out the cartels.
time to round up the despots for undermining the peace and security of honduras.
so about time, now for police and army world wide to follow.... the moment the military and police force in tunesia decided they no longer supported the dictator ben ali, and joined with the protests, is the moment that regime fell.
it made the first free elections possible.
let's hope this will bring back democracy in honduras, and forestall this second coup in a decade.
good.
hopefully the people of honduras return the favour and protest peacefully.
pretty sure that according to the *confessions of an economic hitman* playbook, next step is we invade.
you mean spread freedom?
wasn’t honduras a democracy, then the us helped overthrow it and install a dictatorship?
yeah, then the dictatorship stopped paying the cop's salaries and now they're protesting.
[deleted] yaaa they're doing it because they want higher wages sadly.
pay them a bit more and you'll see their tune change rather quickly.
good boys.
well done!
:) yay for honduras police!
harkin back to when the police in greece were cracking heads because people were upset that their pensions and savings had vanished.
then the police got the news that their own pensions were gone and they switched sides.
police are often it it for themselves.
god bless the police of honduras that can see how they aren't a protected class.
it all comes back around.
that's the ultimate role of police.
to enforce the law and protect the citizens.
they are not there to fight the "enemies" of the government.
that's the job of the military.
and part of the job of the police is to be a large, armed, civilian force that's not the military.
it makes it more difficult for the government to declare the citizens as the enemy.
why are *we* financing honduras?
this is the first time i've ever heard of us doing this.
(by this i mean this specific government - i know we've done this practice many times before.)
power to the people!!
not trying to start shit but isn’t honduras ranked as one of the most dangerous countries in the world?
yes but that doesn’t seem very relevant to this specific discussion.
sound good, good luck.
lead by example i don't think the future robot cops will go about this in the same way.
they're kinda not working because of pay issues, though, not because of some contrived reason they try to pin into politics.
holy shit cops realizing they're not the elites?
sweet wish we had police like this all around the world i'm sure a lot of people know that power is just an illusion and is only granted by how much you allow them to have.
this situation with hernández is a good example of how people in power could easily lose control when people (including the enforcers) just wake up and notice that, in reality, no one has to listen to them.
we are in a social contract to help all of each other out, not a single minority exploiting our acquiescence to their bullshit.
u mean not shoot them at the first chance?
this is the same white house that doesn't believe in climate change and that thought moving its embassy to jerusalem was a good idea.
&gt;the saudi-led military coalition fighting the iran-aligned armed houthi movement in yemen's civil war started blockading ports a month ago after saudi arabia intercepted a missile fired toward its capital riyadh from yemen.
the situation seems similar to the cold war but between regional mid-powers that are opposed on religion rather than politics (though i suppose in saudi arabia and iran, religion is politics).
utterly absurd that anyone would put stock in anything playboy chumps says.
using that as an excuse for violence over their religious hallucinations is ridiculous.
whats that?
if i do believe my ears i think i can make out the growing chant of "reparations" coming from the holy land.
maybe this time germany can give israel double the u-boats.
they've been asking for that since 2009, so what's the fucking difference?
and just in case anybody is curious, germany paid israel over 3,000,000,000 marks back in the 50s and early-60s.

(i'm a bot) ***** &gt; german cancer experts are warning of a looming shortage of one of the most widely used drugs to treat the disease - because pharmaceutical companies say it is not financially worth their time to make it any more.

same boat with a thinkpad p70.
not impressed... maybe lenovo’s bios embedded malware cancels it out.
and then?
what do you do if you are vulnerable?
are we sure this is on the level and they aren't just checking to see who exactly is vulnerable before passing that info to someone else (government, criminals etc)?
he said at the bottom.
update bios.
i had the same thought.
impossible to confirm though... &gt; note that the management engine does not shut down when you press the power button.
&gt; once the malware gets inside the management engine, you can’t get rid of it, even if you could find it, which you can’t.
such malware can run while the processor is running, and it can siphon off data while the computer is in use and the chances are that would never be detected.
ok, so pull the fucken plug.
this feature is *always on*.
pulling the plug is not an option if you still want to use any computer.

it is too deep in the hardware.

(i'm a bot) ***** &gt; the cpu flaw allows malware to reside on nearly any recent intel-based computer manufactured since at least 2015 so that it&amp;#039;s completely undetectable.
&gt; worse, because such malware would have unrestricted access to the communications infrastructure on the compromised computer, you may not even know when the malware is transmitting your most carefully guarded information to the intruders.
&gt; according to the positive technologies researchers, the intel management engine isn&amp;#039;t protected against being downgraded, which means that a bad guy with physical access to the computer can reflash the firmware with an earlier version of the management engine and reinstall the malware.

amd has their own equivalent of ime sadly - they use arm trustzone if i recall right.
its almost like building backdoors into devices is just asking for them to be hacked... but as intel calls it - it is not a backdoor!
/s(just in case) "no sir, that screen door on our bank vault isn't a security risk, its a feature!"
it isn't a backdoor.
this is actually a feature enterprises are asking for.
it didn't show up in there by accident.
it's a security feature if you can control it.
it's an extra layer of security that checks what code the processor is executing.
are there vulnerabilities with this technology?
clearly there are, but it's not uncommon for issues to pop up on new technology.
it'll get fixed sooner or later, otherwise no enterprise is obviously going to want to use insecure cpus.
it wouldn't help: they have the same "feature", but with a different name (which i forgot).

children, pay attention and remember this...never give a woman cause to become this angry at you.
and, never give an angry woman access to your testicles i met my green eyed red haired wife at a mutual friend's party 42 years ago.
i saw her getting a beer and hollared out at her "hey darlin' fetch me a beer while you're in there."
she whirled around, her green eyes looked like twin lasers and her long red hair stated lifting and moving like there was a lot of static electricity in the air.
then she said the words i will never forget.
"eat shit and bark at the moon you son of a bitch.
fetch your own damned beer."
i fell in love with her right then and there.
i was never attracted to meek and timid women.
i always preferred them to have a fiery spirit.
we got married 41 years ago and she still has the fiery spirit i love so much and yes, i still have 3 testicles.
(born mutant) in my experience, people who are unnecessarily confrontational and aggressive in social situations tend to be emotionally abusive and manipulative.
or tend to have been abused and are therefore entitled to be upset “entitled”?
serious question: how is it to have 3 testicles?
what are the pros and cons?
pros: you don't need to buy a newton's cradle.
rip her eyes out with your testicle.
we don't know yet the reason why she did it, the article mentions both pov, the man said he was trying to get her out of his room when she attacked him, while she said she was trying to escape and got pinned down by him and bit him then.
was she in the right?
who knows, there was a article from france a while back of a lady biting a man's penis off cause he tried to rape her.
don't think anyone in the comments tried to defend the guy there.
does it fucking matter?
ok then mister lady hater.
after reading the article its really missing lots of details.
how the hell did his testicle get into her mouth to begin with?
also, why is the punishment not fitting of the crime?
shit...if the guy would have cut her breast off and trashed her house he might get attempted murder.
this entire administration needs a "summer of george".
just start saying and doing the exact opposite of whatever you would normally say or do, because everything you say and do *is wrong.
* the summer of george wasn't where he did the opposite of everything.
it was when george did nothing but sit in a lazy boy recliner all summer.
so you could say the administration has already been in a summer of george.

poland has suffered enough in the past 300 years.
the eu is supposed to be an economic zone.
poland can get german household products while many european auto companies produce car-parts in poland.
and these goods can travel across the border easily.
the eu should not exist to force sovereign countries to take in people they don't want to take in.
the eu was always supposed to be more than an economic union.
poland literally saved europe's ass multiple times: from the turks, from the soviets after ww1.
and now some assholes want turn poland into a black and muslim colony... what a great way to say thanks!
poland has absolutely no obligation to take in anyone.
no country does.
as poland joined the eu and agreed to follow eu laws and decisions, they are indeed obligated to take in refugees after the majority of eu states, including poland, voted in favour of such a distribution mechanism.
there was no such thing in 2004 when it joined.
poland is one of the few remaining countries in the eu which is still european and doesn't shit on indigenous people.
the whole refugee thing is practically a genocide directed at indigenous europeans.
it's like taking a giant shit on the entire history of poland and it's people.
yes, they voted for it just a year or two ago.
why do you hate europeans so much?
absolutely not true, poland did not vote to accept hundreds of thousands of muslims and blacks.
poland already has a million ukrainian refugees.
[poland did vote to distribute 120,000 refugees across europe](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34329825) ...despite the overwhelming opposition to such move from the polish population.

why do you hate blacks so much?
&gt; the eu has gone too far with this shit.
yea, how dare they try to enforce legally binding plans they all voted on and passed with a supermajority!
next they will claim that you have to follow rules and laws and regulations that are aggreed upon and can't just pick and choose!
&gt; yea, how dare they try to enforce legally binding plans they all voted on and passed with a supermajority!
too bad they are not doing that.
notice they are only enforcing it for 3 countries when almost all eu countries failed to fulfill their obligations.
if you want to punish someone for breaching a contract, punish everyone who does it.
instead, they are adding a subjective criteria ("outright refusal") that isnt specified anywhere and wasnt part of the plan that was voted through.
&gt; too bad they are not doing that.
notice they are only enforcing it for 3 countries when almost all eu countries failed to fulfill their obligations.
the others didn't outright refuse it, there is a difference there... no other country outright said "hey fuck you we are not going to do this eventhough its a legally binding thing" &gt; the others didn't outright refuse it, there is a difference there... totally irrelevant, there is nothing like that in the migrant quota deal.
that is a subjective criteria someone made up, it wasnt voted for, it wasnt part of the migrant quotas.
you might as well go a step further and sanction someone for not smiling while they voted for it... you say its about enforcing a legal deal, but its not.
almost every country is breaking that deal.
i can point out which exact part of the migrant quota deal every country is breaking, you cant do the same with "outright refusal, that wasnt part of the contract.
poland voted to accept hundreds of thousands of blacks and muslims?
when?
not in 2004 when they joined the eu firstly, this is about fewer than 9000 people, secondly the vote was between eu governments, and a supermarjority voted for it, thirdly the polish government at the time even voted for it... then poland should tear up the agreement seeing as though germany have invited half of the middle east into the eu.
this is not what poland or many other countries signed up for.
poland is going to get beaten in the eu top court on this issue and waste everyone's time and money before it.
and it will still not change its stance on forced migration quotas.

only problem is you needed an officially certified japanese translation of your driver's license which adds about $100 to the cost.
no problem if you have it already because you are renting a car.

international driver's licenses are $25 at aaa.
$25cad in canada, too.
i rented a (normal) car in tottori with that just fine.
actually got to do this last week while in tokyo, lots of fun.
the locals seemed to be used to driving with these gokarts around.
i was pretty surprised the karts didn't have a seat belt though.
so if i understand correctly, you just need a valid drivers licence from where ever you're from?
or do you need that international drivers permit, too?
you need an international driver’s permit as well.

circumcision is unnecessary.
there.
y'all got your moment in a discussion about girls being flown to foreign countries to have their lives destroyed by zealots.
that said and set aside, how is the irish government handling this?
i hope those girls have resources they can reach out to.
the title esems clickbaity (not the op's fault).
it appears that the girls/women are removed from ireland and having it done back home where fgm is more commonly practiced.
also, for the record: getting your foreskin cut off isn't done to stop you receiving pleasure.
fgm is done for that reason.
please, educate yourselves before you grab a pitchfork.
it also kills a lot of women due to infection, render them almost unable to pee and cause extreme pain during their periods since the "hole" that remains is too small.
they literally cut everything off and turn them into kendolls down there.
it's absolutely horrid.
i have seen the downvotes but fuck it: many many more boys are being mutilated every year and they don't get a headline or a shitstorm.
girls are protected by law and boys (judging by the downvotes here) don't even deserve to be mentioned.
i agree that circumcision should be adressed as well but don't even try saying that it's the same as fgm.
the latter is significantly worse.
are you sure?
nsfw: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj-rnnel0iy are you really so delusional that you think this is how circumcision is typically done?
let's pretend though that your video represents reality.
even in that case their dicks would still work flawlessly after the wound has healed.
they would be able to piss and fuck without issues for the rest of their merry lives, something that women who have been subjected to fgm can't boast about.
their sexual functioning is severely compromised.
just as much as a woman's is destroyed if you remove the clitoris - arguably more because the number of women's nerve endings are split between clitoris and "g spot" so they retain half of them while men's are all in the foreskin and thus are all removed.
actually the foreskin is both 1) way more amount of flesh removed and 2) way more nerve endings than the clitoris.
look it up .
.
.
i'm not saying that fgm ain't fucking terrible and horrifying.
but mgm is also fucking terrible and horrifying.
the foreskin is the primary source of sexual stimulation in men.
it is much larger than the clitoris and contains more than double the number of nerve endings (20,000 vs 8,000).
during intercourse it rubs up and over the corona of the glans (the back ridge of the head of the penis) and this is the vast overwhelming majority of where male sexual stimulation is supposed to come from.
it also protects the head of the penis which is suppose to be a mucus membrane (like the inside of your mouth) from drying out.
circumcised men's penis heads dry out and can't feel which further reduces sexual sensitivity.
both fgm and mgm are terrible, terrible things usually done in horrible ways.
women can still piss after fgm also so i don't know what you're talking about.
neither men nor women can fuck without issues after gm tho.
they are at least equally problematic.
not sure if you just hate men or something but if, after watching how it's done in that video, and being informed of the truth of the anatomy of it all (you were clearly lacking in knowledge), you can still think it's basically ok then you're a pretty callous person.
no, you're fucking wrong and *you* clearly don't know anything about anatomy.
the foreskin is homologous to the clitoral hood and the glans penis is homologous to the clitoral glans.
embryonically, they're the same organ and even in adults there's still a lot of similarity.
learn actual anatomy by starting at [this wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_related_male_and_female_reproductive_organs).
in no way is removing the foreskin in men similar to removing the clitoris in women and the /u/boggsor is correct.
while male circumcision has noted health benefits (reduction of hiv transmittance, reduction of hpv transmittance, reduction of syphilis transmittance, reduction of urinary tract infections, reduction of penile cancer, decreased risk of cervical cancer, cervical dysplasia, hsv-2, chlamydia, and syphilis among women), female circumcision carries risks of recurrent infections, difficulty urinating and passing menstrual flow, chronic pain, the development of cysts, an inability to get pregnant, complications during childbirth, and fatal bleeding.
most notably from the world health organization this year: "there are no known health benefits".
furthermore your claim that male circumcision interferes with sex is so blatantly wrong that it's practically unbelievable.
the highest quality evidence indicates that circumcision does not decrease the sensitivity of the penis, harm sexual function or reduce sexual satisfaction.
a 2013 systematic review found that circumcision did not appear to adversely affect sexual desire, pain with intercourse, premature ejaculation, time until ejaculation, erectile dysfunction or difficulties with orgasm.
another 2013 systematic review found that the highest-quality studies reported no adverse effects of circumcision on sexual function, sensitivity, sensation or satisfaction.
a 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis found that circumcision did not affect premature ejaculation.
there are mountains of scientific evidence that disprove your claim, not to mention the anecdotal evidence from millions of men who have perfectly lively and healthy sex lives after undergoing infant and even adult circumcision.
equating male circumcision with female circumcision is such a disgusting thing to do and your claim that "they are at least equally problematic" is downright offensive and betrays your total ignorance on the subject.
thank you for having the patience to write this.
i completely gave up after the never ending rambling about nerve endings and then being accused of hating men twice.
i think all uncircumcised men can confirm that the foreskins sexual function is completely irrelevant.
i agree that fgm is far worse than male circumcision.
but as an uncircumcised male i strongly disagree with your second point.
also the fact that millions of men who *are* circumcised continue to have great sex to completion without complaint or issue every single day.
i'm trying to smash through the "muh nerve endings" argument but that one probably won't stick.
even though it's based on bunk science.
homologous yes, but take a closer look at the definition of homologous: &gt; similar in position, structure, and evolutionary origin **but not necessarily in function.
** the glans and the clitoris develop from the same embryonic structures as do the foreskin and the hood but, once developed, they are not nearly the same thing.
in terms of sexual functioning, the foreskin is *analogous* (different word) to the clit because of it's high concentration of nerve endings and function as primary area of sexual stimulation.
you are the one that needs to learn a little more anatomy.
i suggest you being by going beyond wikipedia - it's usually only good for the introduction of a subject.
second of all circumcision has actually been shown to increase hiv transmission in africa .
.
.
you seem to be mistake on a lot of things.
no, no, no.
you just continue to be so smug and so wrong.
i'm not going to touch the anatomy argument because you just aren't going to budge from your "nerve endings" argument.
cutting off the clitoris is physically the same as cutting the glans of the penis off.
the bottom line is that it has been proven time and time again with high quality scientific studies that [male circumcision does not affect sexual function, sensitivity, or satisfaction.
](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23937309) &gt; circumcision has actually been shown to increase hiv transmission in africa holy shit, how badly do you have to misinterpret data to get the exact wrong conclusion?
every study and meta-analysis have shown significantly decreased hiv transmission to the point that the who recommends circumcision as part of the strategy to combat the hiv/aids epidemic in africa.
["there is now strong evidence from three randomized controlled trials undertaken in kisumu, kenya, rakai district, uganda \(funded by the us national institutes of health\) and orange farm, south africa \(funded by the french national agency for research on aids\) that male circumcision reduces the risk of heterosexually acquired hiv infection in men by approximately 60%"](http://www.who.int/hiv/mediacentre/news68/en/) no no no?
you mean you want to ignore what homologous means?
and now you don't wanna talk about it?
why would that be?
is it because what i said is factually true and you have no viable argument against it anymore (that homologous means "similar in position, structure, and evolutionary origin but not necessarily in function.")?
because that is science.
are you trying to argue against science here?
secondly, the hiv thing is far from well understood.
other theories is that the foreskin decreases friction during intercourse and so circumcised penises rub a lot more creating more raw tissue which makes hiv transmission a lot easier.
but i bet you're gonna ignore that.
as far as the who "study" you mention.
there are severe methodological problems with it and it has been heavily critiqued in the scientific community.
but it lets us ignore the mgm problem so let's go ahead and ignore the critiques (get it?).
aside from that tho, if removing the clitoris helped women not get hiv do you think anyone would advocate that?
absolutely fucking not.
get it yet?
&gt; you mean you want to ignore what homologous means?
and now you don't wanna talk about it?
i mean i'm not going to argue over semantics and definitions.
you're attempting to derail the argument in a million different directions so that if you can "win" one argument, you can say you've won them all.
it's troll tactics and i'm not going to engage you on them.
&gt; because that is science.
no, that's logomachy and it's irrelevant to the point.
&gt; are you trying to argue against science here?
you're arguing against science.
i've offered you scientific, peer-reviewed medical journal articles and you've chosen to turn this into an argument about words.
&gt; secondly, the hiv thing is far from well understood.
no, it is very well understood.
i'd challenge you to go ahead and write an email to a doctor specializing in this area and ask them if it's "far from well understood" but i know you definitely won't.
male circumcision leads to drastically reduced hiv transmission risk.
several robust studies have been performed that have found this conclusion.
you're probably trying to argue that the mechanism for this result is not well-understood, [but it is](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc1127372/).
there's significant evidence that hiv targets langerhans' cells as their primary point of entry and vector of dissemination.
there is a large number of these cells in the inner mucosal surface between the foreskin and glans.
&gt; other theories is that the foreskin decreases friction during intercourse and so circumcised penises rub a lot more creating more raw tissue which makes hiv transmission a lot easier.
yeah, that "theory" is more like a hypothesis.
howe believes that that could be the case and advances it as though it were proven fact.
every other (legitimate) source you can find points to an obvious, statistically significant reduction in hiv because of circumcision.
&gt; but i bet you're gonna ignore that.
and risk you trying to pull another "gotcha!"?
yeah, i'll take that bet.
this article by [rs van howe](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc5345479/) (which you would probably point to, if you ever cited an actual source) is a downright embarrassment and his nit-picks with the who studies &gt; there are severe methodological problems with it are not legitimate methodological complaints at all.
van howe even goes so far as to claim that because the studies were set up in the same way, they're susceptible to the same biases.
what van howe is complaining about is what's known as "test-retest reliability" (the ability to reproduce a given result) and it's what constitutes **good science.
** his complaints about the real researchers' study designs and methodologies is totally embarrassing, not to mention totally unsupported, even by himself.
he pulls general complaints and assumptions out of thin air and claims them as dealbreakers.
&gt; heavily critiqued in the scientific community [citation needed] one researcher critiquing loudly and often does not "the scientific community" make.
&gt; aside from that tho, if removing the clitoris helped women not get hiv do you think anyone would advocate that?
what has been **proven** (not conjectured by one person) is that removing the foreskin from the penis decreases risks of acquiring and transmitting a host of stis including hiv, syphilis, hpv, and urinary tract infections and has no effect on sexual function, sensitivity, or satisfaction.
what has also been proven is that female circumcision increases risks of recurrent infections, difficulty urinating and passing menstrual flow, chronic pain, the development of cysts, sterility, complications during childbirth, and fatal bleeding.
if this were not the case, if it were such that removing a woman's clitoris decreased risks of acquiring and transmitting hiv, syphilis, hpv, and urinary tract infections and has no effect on sexual function, sensitivity, or satisfaction, then perhaps people would advocate for that.
but your "argument" here relies on a totally false equivalence.
&gt; get it yet?
yes, i think i do.
and still, i don't think you do.
the only person citing scientific studies (and literature reviews no less) is him.
you make lots of appeals to "science" but show no evidence.
what you're doing is actually more akin to hypothesizing , the first step to actual science.
you're taking things that we know about the development of these structures and reasoning that they must have an effect on sensitivity or function.
however studies have been provided which show the exact opposite result.
by the scientific method we should doubt your purely theoretical reasoning.
seems you need to 1) directly address his evidence and 2) provide your own.
how can the foreskin reduce friction?
it gets pulled back during intercourse.
women are supposed to be aroused during intercourse, and thus provide enough lubrication.
how have you been having sex?
o.o mah man!
have an upvote!
if it was the same for men they would've had to cut the entire penis off.
that's essentially what they're doing to these girls.
right.
if they were doing to women what they were doing to men, they'd be cutting off the labia minora.
but what they're doing is more like cutting off the whole penis, removing the scrotum, and then some (because they're sewing uteri nearly shut as well as other pretty terrible things) comparing the foreskin to the clitoris?
really?
a serious comparison would be that removing the clitoris is more like removing the head of the penis.
i happen to have foreskin and i'll tell you that rubbing the foreskin feels like rubbing your lips.
sure it's sensitive, but not at all in a sexual way.
the head of the penis is what matters for pleasure, and the female equivalent is the clitoris.
&gt; the head of the penis is what matters for pleasure, and the female equivalent is the clitoris this is anatomically wrong.
you're ignoring science.
the nerve ending concentration is in the foreskin, not the glans.
there are 20000 nerve endings in the foreskin.
and without the foreskin the glans dries up (supposed to be a mucus membrane) and gets calloused so it can't feel either so it loses its sensitivity too i.e.
removing the foreskin deadens the penis's sensitivity in 2 major ways.
cutting off the head of the penis is way more flesh than the clit, cutting off the foreskin is way more nerve endings .
.
.
either way is horrific, just as horrific as fgm.
if you can't see that then your lack of logic is astounding.
or maybe you just hate men.
i don't really care which.
have a nice day.
yea, anyone with a penis foreskin would disagree with you.
i honestly don't care about this issue, but the way you are belittling people, while being wrong at the same time, is shameful.
a clitoris is a female analogue of the male's penis head.
i know that because i learned it in high school.
actually the clitoris is the anatomical equivalent to the whole penis... [and the foreskin is the anatomical equivalent of the clitoral hood, so what's the point of your statement?
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_related_male_and_female_reproductive_organs) to be honest i didn't start out belittling people.
i started out sharing information and discussing things nicely.
if you actually read these threads you'll see it's others started the negativity.
&gt; a clitoris is a female analogue of the male's penis head.
i know that because **i learned it in high school.
** bwahahahahahahhaa [the foreskin is equivalent to the clitoral hood.
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_related_male_and_female_reproductive_organs) the clit is what develops into the penis in boys.
the most sensitive area of the penis is the frenulum, it's not on the foreskin.
i have no idea what you're talking about... the g-spot is a myth.
the vast majority of women get sexual pleasure from clitoral stimulation.
you have no idea what you're talking about.
i have had multiple partners who had orgasms more intensely and more easily from a particular area inside getting stimulated.
i've also had partners of whom this wasn't true.
even just campaigning to end mgm gets you labeled as intolerant.
and for the record i do think fgm is a bigger issue right now.
i don't think we need to argue over it - both sides should be working together for the common goal of ending genital mutilation.
downvotes come from guys who are bitter about their own partial penis removal why do people like you have to turn everything into a conversation about men?
no, it's not the same.
when boys are having their entire dicks cut off, then we'll talk.
male circumscision isn't anywhere near as painful, life-altering, and barbaric.
women who have their clitoris' mutilated and their labia sewn together can never experience sexual pleasure again.
most women experience pleasure from clitoral stimulation alone.
there is just no both sides equivalency here.
millions of young males in the united states have the same problem every year and nobody bats an eye.
peak whataboutism.
there is a difference between getting circumcised as a male as a baby or later having to have it done as a senior as the skin loses elasticity cutting off the blood flow to the tip of your penis and causing infections and mutilating a woman to take all pleasure out of sex by removing the clit and sowing up all sensitive areas to prevent promiscuity amongst their daughters.
its like comparing a bike accident on a side walk and a car crash at a 120 miles per hour not wearing a seat belt.
why would anyone do that to their children ?
is it a cultural thing in some areas ?
the middle east and northern africa.
i live in north africa , in morocco and this is not true at all , i think they meant the middle countries in africa .
north is just arabic people and its male circumcision not women .
the middle and southern african countries do that in some villages.
out of curiosity, do consider africans like brothers so some degree.
if a pan african movement started, would you country join it?
actually a lot of our southern african brothers come here to study and they have same and more rights than us and whenever something happens our king is the first to help them , we send food soldiers planes w/e is needed for help .
so you think something like african states can work in the future.
nop not at all , too many selfish leaders and countries in here to do that .
imo i's not possible , it wasnt possibe in the past and certainly not in the present and it won't be in the futur .
would common people be ok with it?
religion as in islam.
almost exclusively islam.
yeah for males it's islam but females not at all , we don't do that at all .
religion which relegion is it again ?
cause i'm a muslim and there is nothing in our relegion saying you have to that to females nope it's culture.
it's done by muslims and christians alike.
local education helps a lot in preventing this what?
millions of young males in the united states have their dickheads cut off completely?
or were you making a very silly false analogy?
depends, some fgm is just removal of the clitoral hood so basically the same.
it's all fucked up though.
probably because the us is ridiculously judaicised.
never before in history have 'christians' placed so much in circumcision.
it's just a fucked up country.
when you circumsize a boy nobody bats an eye, when you do it to a woman its "world news" welcome to the world where only boys privates are allowed to be mutilated because it's 'totally different' and female bits are special.
it happens on every thread, even reports exclusively about circumcision, a user will pop up and go "b-but muh fgm is worse" and refuse to achknowledge how equally awful circumcision is.
they're both as bad as eachother but whenever you dare mention one, the other side takes it as you saying its worse than the other.
mgm is not as bad, that could be the reason you keep hearing it.
this is just a drawing but might be nsfw, tell me again how this isn't worse: http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcruhmoqoowhickenoz7fsqozrpbc7ozqdtypejrq-2lov05ugkpvq all circumcision is bad but one doesn't render the person unable to pee normally and it doesn't involve cutting off and stitching up the entire area, stopping them from having sex at all unless they're cut open again.
both should be banned, the entire practice is barbaric regardless of gender but fgm is worse regardless of what you may think.
that's why people keep saying it.
stop both and i'll be happy.
kind of weird to focus on women, given that genital mutilation is much rarer in that population.
yes, but the operations are *not* comparable.
fgm is exponentially worse and i say that as a british guy who thinks circumcision should be illegal &gt; fgm is exponentially worse are you sure?
nsfw: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj-rnnel0iy ho lee shit yea .
.
.
sorry for that.
shoulda tagged nsfw now that i think of it.
nsfl more like, jesus fuck; who would do that *willingly*!?!?!
the cultural pressure to do it must be insane.
the force of will it must take to stand there while someone pulls your dick taut and slices it with a dull blade is unfathomable to me.
maybe that was one of the motivating factors for the migration of homo sapiens out of africa?
i could just imagine some of the smarter africans going "fuck this shit, i'm packing my bags and leaving this continent".
then migrating north, interbreeding with some neanderthals (in europe) or denisovans (in asia) and building modern civilizations.
meanwhile, the ones too stupid to leave africa are still there in the year 2017, still cutting each other's dicks off with dull knives.
**#allculturesareequal** it is exponentially worse, bringing up the worst cases of mgm doesn't negate the millions of girls who've had their clits cut off and labia sown together in unsanitary conditions.
can't we all agree that no genital mutilation should take place and leave it at that?
depends on what's done.
some methods are worse, some aren't.
since, like you, i'm not interested in defending any form of genital mutilation, not much point in pretending that there's some acceptable level of genital mutilating.
i like my circumcized dick.
i don't want extra skin there... circumcised women say similar things.
wtf, no they don't.
i assume it is painful and feels bad.
but if it makes life easier like it does for men circumcision then let them be.
how would a guy know if it makes life easier if it was done at birth?
there's soap readily available now, there's no need to cut things off if you live in a place where there's soap... &gt; fgm is exponentially worse isn't it true that the foreskin contains more nerves than the clitoris?
if that's the case, how is fgm exponentially worse if done in e.g.
a hospital?
yes, many times more.
no?
and even if it did, you'd need to compare cutting off the entire tip of the penis actually the foreskin is both 1) way more flesh removed and 2) way more nerve endings than the clitoris.
look it up .
.
.
i'm not saying that fgm ain't fucking terrible and horrifying.
but mgm is also fucking terrible and horrifying.
the foreskin *is* the primary source of sexual stimulation.
it is much larger than the clitoris and contains more than double the number of nerve endings (20,000 vs 8,000).
during intercourse it rubs up and over the corona of the glans (the back ridge of the head of the penis) and this is the vast overwhelming majority of where male sexual stimulation is supposed to come from.
it also protects the head of the penis which is suppose to be a mucus membrane (like the inside of your mouth) from drying out.
circumcised men's penis heads dry out and can't feel which further reduces secual sensitivity.
circumcised men (in the west) don't want to believe that anything terrible and destructive has been done to their dicks.
but seriously, circumcised men will never even remotely know what sex is supposed to be like - not even close.
and i am speaking as one of them.
none of this is made up.
none of it is exaggerated.
both fgm and mgm are terrible, terrible things usually done in horrible ways.
in the industrialized world, circumcision of babies is far less brutal, but equally destructive of sexual functioning.
&gt;20,000 vs 8,000 right, but they follow the inverse square law, and a clitoris vs. foreskin size comparison will show you straight away which is more sensitive why can't we just go ahead and say that both the clitoris and the foreskin are crucial to sexual stimulation and that removal of either is fucking horrible?
why does one sex have to win at suffering more?
if both men and women, in large numbers, are getting their genitals mutilated and their sexual pleasure ruined with rusty blades then i think dismissing either one is extremely callous.
i never said they're not both horrible.
but fgm is objectively worse, that doesn't detract from mgm in any way.
i already stated in my original comment i'd make mgm illegal how is it objectively worse tho?
because the clit is more sensitive and the damage done during the procedure is worse?
i read an autobiography about a supermodel from somalia who had this done.
she was forced down, had her clit and inner lips (can't remember the term in english) cut off with a dull blade, her skin punctured by thorns and her labia was sown back up again without anathesia.
this caused peeing to take 15 minutes, her period caused extreme pain since there wasn't enough room for the blood to come out, she had to undergo surgery to have sex and before that a co-worker saw her naked and burst into tears.
sometimes they get cut open with knives again after marriage just so the guy can penetrate.
having your foreskin cut off as a baby doesn't really seem like the worst scenario out of these two.
i'm against both but no, mgm is *not* as bad.
not by a long shot.

tax payer money funds the research.
tax payer money pays the publication fees.
the scientific community does the referee work for free.

yes it will... they need to fight otherwise they'll never be free, they have more population they can just overrun the place red army style you seem...unclear about what's happening over there.
the way for them to be "free" is to revert the investment they make in tunnels and weaponry towards taking care of their population.
then, and only then, the egyptian and israeli blockade will be removed, and gaza will be free to take its place among the prospering nations.
lol .
like the west bank did .
look how faster the palestinians are loosing land over there.
because they're unarmed and easier to contain and way easier to opress .
the israeli cant advance 100 m into gaza without suffering .
better keep it this way .
&gt; look how faster the palestinians are loosing land over there.
how fast?
how much land was "lost" last year?
the year prior?
give some numbers.
&gt; the israeli cant advance 100 m into gaza without suffering keep thinking that.
we support that view.
then when time comes, we'll bring out the popcorn while we watch [hamas run away dressed as women](https://www.algemeiner.com/2014/07/23/canadas-the-globe-and-mail-reports-seeing-hamas-fighters-dressed-as-women-one-concealing-weapon-in-baby-blanket-like-an-infant/).
pfft.... you dont seem to understand that an oppressed people whose daily intake of calories is counted and rationed, prisoners in their own lands etc would never prosper under the yoke of foreign invaders... why didnt the jewish people in nazi concentration camps visualize freedom and thereby become free?
your data seems to be at least 4 years out of sync.
time to get up with the news.
hamas' government predates the blockade.
they made a conscious choice to embark into hostilities.
it's a nice appeal to emotion there, but i am very surprised that someone that seems obsessed with wwii ("red army style", "nazi") doesn't consider the fact that the jews were not being armed, trained and propped up by a major power like, say, hamas is used by iran.
irrelevant.
yes, you are.
dont chase me im full of chocolate https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk7ifebaajo they called for one after israel placed metal detector on temple mount to stop terrorist attacks.
hamas is a joke.
- about two years of stabbing/shooting attacks in the temple mount.
- israeli female soldier killed in a shooting by a terrorist hiding among muslims worshippers.
- israel finally takes measures to prevent smuggling weapons into the temple mount.
- hamas calls for intifada for israelis taking measures to prevent terror attacks.
logic.
wasn't it also due to israel taking unilateral decision concerning the temple mount contrary to their deal with jordan who are supposed to have overseeing control?
edit : wow massive downvotes for adding context, people really hate nuance appearently!
it had to be done unilaterally because jordan nor the waqf nor the pa care about it.
if they cared about the security of jews, they would have placed a metal detectors years ago or at least allowed israel to place it.
but no.
they didn't do either.
they don't fucking care.
iirc the victims in the stabbing that lead to the cameras weren't jews - they were druz.
and they still didn't care.
probably but you can see why this would cause anger, israel breaking it's agreement and exerting control over temple mount?
they didn't even make the attempt to deal with the waqf after the attack.
they must have known there would be a harsh response to what was understandably a logical security measure, but it came unilaterally from their "occupier".
because if the waqf had any intention of increasing security, that'd have been done long before israel took matters into its own hands.
true, but it was still israel taking unilateral decision contrary to an agreement they signed onto.
ofcourse it was going to go badly, it looked like israel taking control of the temple mount and breaking the accord.
but the repeated terrorist violence didn't look like that?
yikes no, because in their eyes israel is the dangerous enemy.
they have occupied east jerusalem and any unilateral decisions about the temple mount may look like them taking control of the site.
unilateral action to stop terrorist violence and war crimes is bad ... why, again?
aint that the guy that lives in a fancy hotel in qatar or something?
from his 5 star resort in qatar what a peaceful organisation.
the portal 2 credit song comes to mind.
&gt;well here we are again it's always such a pleasure remember when you tried to kill me twice?
&gt;oh how we laughed and laughed except i wasn't laughing under the circumstances i've been shockingly nice art of the deal.
i hope seal seal team 6 is hunting for this guy, along with all the leaders of hamas and hezbollah.
these terrorists don't realize they're going to be 100% out of business before president trump's first term is up.
they don't realize trump and netanyahu are going clean things up one way or the other.
no more kicking the can down the road with terrorists like them, iran, and nk.
i beleive the games are over 🇺🇸💪🏻🇮🇱 why israel, it was the us that pulled this shit?
god fucking damn, these guys are assholes.
israel is right next door, america is on the other side of the world.
i read this as '...calls for antifa against israel', and was confused for a moment there.
it's very close to being the same thing, actually.
more stabbing jews and less punching nazis.
but i see your point.
and here's someone that knows very little about what htey are talking about i mean, it's a group of angry people going out to start a riot.

thanks hamas!
have you ever actually read the hamas charter?
they hate the lion's club, man.
the lion's club.
why?
because those evil lions, rotary and masonic lodges were in league with zionists!
(ahem) the hamas motto?
"*allah is its target, the prophet is its model, the koran its constitution: jihad is its path and death for the sake of allah is the loftiest of its wishes.
*" so how'd they get in there to control gaza?
voted in!
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/26/ar2006012600372.html so, yeah.
thanks "hamas".
:/ for fuck sake, i hope he will be judged for this disaster one day on trump's list of fuck ups this one is kind of small and all the groups that are pissed off about this arent exactly friends to america and israel to begin with hamas are already working to destroy israel as best they can, this incident wont change their attitudes towards israel this does not seem like the logical reaction to the situation.
if kim jong un said today it recognized toronto as the capital of the united states, i doubt leaders in canada would call for an uprising against the united states.
some people are quick to find excuses for violence, others love playing the victim, and others such as president trump love rattling the birdcage.
no physical change has occurred to the city since trump gave his unnecessary speech.
yet one day later jerusalem is still the capital of palestine, palestinians still live in the city as they did last week, and all but 2 counties in the world still recognize tel aviv as the capital of israel.
are you under the mistaken impression that jerusalem is under palestinian control like toronto is under canadian control, or are you just really awful at making analogies?
awful at analogies it would seem.
the point is that violence is can not be the response to mere words by any civilized people.
for hamas to call to an uprising against israel for no other reason than the words of the us president half a world away is terrible.
there are deplorable human beings in this world that look for any reason to incite violence.
you take a very high-minded perspective on this.
perhaps you are naive to the realities on the ground and the scope of the history that has led people to this point.
quick?
palestinians have been under occupation for nearly 70 years.. hamas was founded only in 1987, this formation of violent terror groups has been a relatively slow process given the circumstances.
especially when you consider the work of the irgun in the 1930s.
palestinian terror didn't exist before 1987?
liar.
the irgun formed in reaction to palestinian massacres of innocent jews in 1929, so the plo was already killing jews in 1964. you know, 3 fucking years before jordan (not the palestinians!)
lost the west bank to israel in a war they started.

oh boy, are romans coming to conquor all?
they were good with law and order at least seems pretty backwards already.
even darker, huh?
he just took america back to the dark ages, now he’s helping the rest of the world catch up (or down).
making statements like this is complete hyperbole and will likely be the thing that gets innocent people killed.
literally nothing has changed from yesterday till today.
jerusalem was israel's capital even if the us hadn't officially recognized it.
today it is the same.
no building has moved yet, no troops have mobilized, no one's life has been upended by this.
all the fallout from this is purely political.
saying that this will lead to violence is the same as encouraging it.
it's like saying that violence is a logical response to a diplomatic maneuver, and you can't blame riotous murderers for rioting and murdering, because it is logical to have your passions inflamed by something like this.
it's completely nonsensical and reckless.

this is exactly correct.
this is a strange thing to say and negates any historical context or credence to disputes in the area.
there's a reason iran funds hezbola... that's just the obvious example.
palestinians like to think they have a claim on the city.
it's possible that one day they will get east jerusalem as the capital of their own state.
but there is zero peace deal scenario that happens where at least west jerusalem is their capital.
yes, the land is disputed.
but right now, the entire city is still israel's capital.
it has been entirely annexed by israel, its parliament and supreme court are there.
**israel is literally run out of the city of jerusalem.
** that's simply reality.
the move by trump does nothing to permanently block palestine from getting east jerusalem in a peace agreement.
i believe europe is implying colonialism time.
&gt;trump's decision to put american diplomats near israeli diplomats is really bad because reasons this is celebrity news levels of stupid.
i'd gild you, but i'm broke.
have a virtual gilding.
israel's government operates out of tel aviv for security reasons.
having your diplomats where the government actually operates makes the most sense, and antagonizing half of a hostile situation by denying their claim to contested territory isn't a path to peace.
so these are just shell buildings, then?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/knesset &gt;the knesset is located in givat ram, jerusalem.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beit_aghion &gt;...the official residence of the prime minister of israel.
it is located at 9 smolenskin street, on the street corner of balfour street in the upscale jerusalem neighborhood of rehavia, situated between the city center and talbiya neighborhood.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supreme_court_of_israel &gt;the supreme court is situated in jerusalem's givat ram governmental campus.
good, perhaps they'll finally destroy each other and the land can be used respectfully.
if ww3 breaks out anywhere, it will be in the middle east, not north korea, and this decision by trump, adding unrest in an aleady unstable region - disregarding international law and despite all the advise against it by allies and the only sane people in his administration, tillerson and ‘mad dog’ mcmasters and mattis - may turn out to be a significant contributor to that.
can we have titles that actually say what exactly happened now?

&gt; if trump had recognised west jerusalem as israel&amp;#039;s capital and east jerusalem as a future palestinian capital he would also have pre-empted negotiations, but even-handedly but his recognition of jerusalem as israel&amp;#039;s capital pre-empted in israel&amp;#039;s favour the resolution of the final status of the city that palestinians also claim as their capital.
&gt; commenting on trump&amp;#039;s refusal to press for a palestinian state, the former us ambassador to israel and peace envoy martin indyk said, &amp;quot;it&amp;#039;s another nail in the coffin of the peace process, which already had a lot of nails in it."

until islam modernizes by rejecting wahabism and sharia and giving women and gays and other "infidels" equal rights to muslims in the middle east there will never be peace.
yes, lets blame trump and not the people who are creating the violence.
that's smart!
sad!
war is peace - $$$$ the last thing trump wants is peace in the middle east.
if we don't have a big looming enemy, how is he going to rile up the stupid rednecks that vote for him?
he'll have to go back to hating mexicans and might actually have to build his big retarded wall.
not really.
middle eastern themselves don't want peace, so while trump did not make it any easier, he certainty didn't 'put nail in coffin'.
how dare he declare jerusalem the capitol of israel.
it's totally not the historical capital or anything.
you really don't understand do you?
understand that the angry muslims in palenstine were angry before he declared this, and will be angry after he declared it?
it is about time that a president actually stands with israel.
but let's blame a guy that had nothing to do with the violence in the middle east.

this is insane!]
- david davis admits no impact assessment has been done - uses the term *sectoral analysis* instead; says a report that uses the word impact is not an impact assessment - says economic models have all been wrong so he has not requested economic modeling - says that the uk government has received the majority of all paperwork since *remaining paperwork is duplicate or early report* - rees-mogg spins this **atrociously** by saying "*if no impact assessments exist then the government have gone above and beyond by providing paperwork to parliament since they requested impact assessments*" (whichever side of the fence you sit on that was just outrageous; he should have kept quiet) - responds that brexit will not see a drop in eu nurses in the uk (despite eu nurse applications dropping 96% since brexit) - the eu parliament has been briefed to a greater extent by uk politicians than the uk parliament - davis states that a contingency plan exist - highlights that contingency plans are based on real-life scenarios such as nuclear inspections; not theoretical economic events - davis tries to leave; rees-mogg reminds him that the speaker said nothing is more important than giving evidence.
ouch!
&gt; in february you told mps: “we continue to analyse the impact of our exit across the breadth of the uk economy.” the commons motion calling for the impact assessments used that language.
davis says *that is not the same as an impact assessments.
* **final question (which summarises nicely)** &gt; benn: did the government undertake an assessment of leaving the customs union before the cabinet took that decision?
davis: not a quantitative one, no, says davis.
&gt; benn: isn’t that extraordinary?
davis: no.
the range of different outcomes it too wide.
some free trade agreements have been very effective, and others haven’t.
ministers had to take a judgment.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **additional context** - 25 june, davis: we have got 50, nearly 60 sectoral analyses done - 06 dec, davis: no impact assessments have been done on the impact of brexit - dec 2016, davis: we are in the midst of carrying out about 57 sets of analyses, each of which has implications for individual parts of 85% of the economy.
- dec 2017, davis: the usefulness of such detailed impact assessments is near zero.
&gt; rees-mogg spins this atrociously by saying "if no impact assessments exist then the government have gone above and beyond by providing paperwork to parliament since they requested impact assessments" my sides.
i don't really understand what he means by this.
please could you elaborate for me?
**&lt;edit&gt;cheers.
i guess it was less sophisticated than i was expecting.&lt;/edit&gt;** he's basically saying: "they asked for something, we didn't have it, so they should be happy that we at least provided something.
in giving them something when we had nothing, we've gone above and beyond the call of duty" which, of course, is dog shit.
it sounds like he's being *extremely* dryly sarcastic to me.
sarcastically criticising a conservative government is not something rees-mogg would even think of doing you never know with the british.
am brit, can confirm mogg is not being sarcastic; he's just a prick.
yank here.
i barely follow uk politics, and i can't see rees-mogg's name without hearing david mitchell cough-shouting "twat".
let's put it this way.
there is a character called jacob reece in x-men comics who was briefly possessed by the shadow king, a malevolent entity that seeks only eternal conflict across the world, agitating it wherever he goes, only to die in the uk.
it is not entirely implausible that rees-mogg is reusing an old name, adding a mogg, and doing it all over again.
a friend of mine in the 80s one threw a sausage roll at rees-mogg.
at the time i was very embarrassed, now i am so proud.
1. parliament requests that the government undertake impact assessments.
2. the government claims repeatedly to be doing them.
3. the government turns up with a few scraps of paper and some talking points, but admits they haven't done meaningful assessments.
4. rees-mogg deftly suggests that since there are no assessments to present, parliament should be grateful to receive anything at all.
5. everyone laughs at him.
yes but also not quite.
he is *lawyering* the words impact assessment.
he is saying that **you** requested an impact assessment, **we** only recognise the word *sectoral analyses*.
so **we** did our best to try and respond to **your** shit request.
so be grateful.
ah, i had missed out on that particular weaselly nuance.
serves me right for not watching it live.
by the way, thanks for the thread and the curated posts.
no worries countryman.
*concerned colonial in residence teacher asked for homework, but the pupil went above and beyond by drawing a magenta spurting cock and calling it homework.
or something equally nonsensical using long words and bullshit-speak.
imagine you spent a week telling your teacher all about how much work you were putting into your world war 2 essay, and how impressive and detailed it was going to be.
and then on the due date you hand her a sheaf of pages printed from the wikipedia article about hitler stapled together.
when she asks you about it you reply, "well it seems i didn't even do the assignment at all.
so if you think about it, considering i had nothing to turn in at all, handing in those pages from wikipedia is more than you would normally have gotten otherwise.
therefore i deserve ~~partial~~ extra credit."
and then you drooled all over the teacher's desk and shit yourself, because it turns out you've been literally mentally handicapped this whole time and how the fuck did nobody notice?
and that's what basically happened here, if i understand it correctly myself.
&gt; "...therefore i deserve partial credit."
ress-mogg's "above and beyond" would suggest that he thinks he deserves *extra* credit for doing-- well, fuck-all.
&gt; responds that brexit will not see a drop in eu nurses in the uk (despite eu nurse applications dropping 96% since brexit) probably the same thing will happen with doctors.
that's ok because people have had enough of experts /s 'take a judgement' would you not want an impact assessment to base your judgement on?
'no.
feelings and political leanings will do just fine.
i think god would tell us if we were making a mistake' 'or the talking toaster, he normally does' you can't make this stuff up lol meanwhile the eu has carried out 47 (that they've made publicly available).
edit: i didn't expect this slightly pithy remark to get so high up on here.
[here is a link to the eu impact assessment page.
](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/en/ukevents/brexit/brexitstudies.html) at this point the eu is really hammering home how much of a ball ache it is for nations to leave the eu.
they are doing a very effective job at establishing a precedence of wave after wave of deterrents.
maybe the uk can ask to share their research?
maybe join some sort of agreement to cooperate or something??
what?
like some sort of union?
but if we do that then the nhs will lose £350 million a week.

fucking thomas lying all the time!
&gt;lose £350 million a week pffff.... american healthcare: "hold my beer" so that's it, huh?
we're some kind of european union?
what are you, weak &amp; unstable?
&gt; eu has carried out 47 look at al that wasted money.... i can't wait for us to get out!
/s "what's life without a little risk?"
-uk government "yolo (you only leave once)" - uk government even that statement has more risk assessment than what the uk govt has performed.
you laugh but a lot of brexiteers feel that way.
a solid chunk of the brexit vote was based on "feels over reals" and a rejection of modern economics they're the sort of geniuses that are against any taxes going to roads because, hey, we've already got plenty of roads!
our government are fucking special.
when you censor reports because you didn't even bother to do the research.
they did it.
they just can't publish it, because it's a side of a4 with 'we're all completely fucked' written in crayon.
&gt;implying they're not stupid enough to just eat the crayon because they think they're pen shaped sweets i'd be careful with this view, the tory party is a complex and intelligent machine, theresa may and her government are going to take the fall for the conservative party.
at some point they'll be replaced by another team and a bunch of buzzwords will dart around, people will 'take charge,' policy will be 'totally scrapped,' but in reality, the people in the party that are in control will not change.
for an incompetent group of fools, they are doing really well at dismantling and selling the nhs right now, or forcing people off state benefit into homelessness or death.
remember that health care spending in the uk is just 8.5% of gdp, that is significantly lower than the rest of the world, it's a really good system.
but looking at the news, the government reports, it sounds like a disaster, that it needs completely replaced.
the narrative of mrs may and her wrenching awkward held together with glue government is pervasive, but it's a controlled narrative, one hand is showing you that, while the other is damaging the social and economic heart of the country for personal gain.
&gt; health care spending in the uk is just 8.5% of the gdp made me interested to see the us's holy fuck its 17.8% what the hell are we doing?
making healthcare for profit and not seeing an issue with people getting into medical debt because they dared to get cancer, basically.
you could build an nhs that was twice as good as ours and still have enough money for more tanks.
i think you just figured out how to sell public health care to america.
this is exactly how i see it.
the party are not as stupid as they may seem and they are moving quickly to abolish benefits for large groups of people without remorse while the greater population gossip and complain about brexit.
i wish people would do away with the tendency to call politicians in power clueless.
clearly the people in power have a good understanding of politics and how to accomplish their agenda.
might be a stupid agenda, but these are not stupid people yes, you may not agree with them but that doesn't mean they are stupid.
never underestimate your enemies.
it's the standard modern right-wing plan - reduce the population to uneducated wage slaves who are cheap to maintain, while taxing any remaining middle classes to keep the 0.1% tax free.
easy to do when you are so disconnected from the population that you see them as practically non-human.
american here.
same thing happens in the states.
our ancestors are turning over in their graves.
i have always said boris is a shark.
he plays the good natured fool perfectly but has an equal education to david cameron and george osborne, two highly seasoned bastards.
he is just playing the long game.
i truly believe he wants to be churchill ii and is biding his time.
hammond is particularly dangerous in this respect.
he has cultivated the reputation of being the only adult in the cabinet, but in the mean time he's the one with his hand around the throat of the nhs.
1: create a nefarious and overly-complicated plan.
2: successfully execute it.
3: sit in an armchair in front of a roaring fire.
4: sip your martini.
(any other fancy alcoholic beverage will also do) 5: laugh maliciously and whisper, "just as planned."
but seriously this is probably partly true but i do think you might be underestimating how many tories hate may right now.
she has several times gone against/accidentally undermined the tories.
you're right they are happy to use her as a scapegoat but it isn't just as planned either.
ironically it's just as likely that your narrative is infact the one the tories are desperately trying to push; this is all "just as planned" because of how reliant their image is on a steady hand, clear vision, etc.
your machivellian explanation would actually convince some tory voters that conservatives aren't as hopeless as they current look.
fun story: my brother works at sprouts (grocery store in the us) and sent me two crayons, one saying 'carrot' and the other saying 'cucumber' or something.
so, being the complete muppet that i am, i took a bite out of the carrot thinking that that was the flavour name.
turns out my bro sent them to me becuase the carrot one was green and the cucumber one was orange and he thought it was funny that it was the wrong way round.
long story short, i'm about as dumb as a politician.
i would still vote for you over any of these muppets... he's admitted to making a mistake so he's already more trustworthy.
ok, i know we are kidding, but seriously this.
i don't know why politicians are obsessed with this delusional idea of being infallible.
i mean, jfk took responsibility for a failed invasion and his ratings actually soared!
sadly we have people who would hear boris johnson actually admit all the shit really believes/wants, yet they’ll still laugh at his [funny hair](https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article10196716.ece/alternates/s615/britains-foreign-secretary-boris-johnson-leaves-at-the-end-of-a-bilateral-meeting-during-a-g7-for-f.jpg) pretty sure the crayon got stuck up someone’s nose.
but not up the arse that's where their heads are it doesn't make any sense whatsoever that they wouldn't do it but it's really shady that they can blatantly lie like that and not have any consequences welcome to the us, where everyone sucks at their job and no one is held accountable?
oh wait wrong country... nonsense.
it's also signed and dated.
*edit: to be read in sir humphry's voice* project zeus if the public will accept me, i’ll be johnsons camilla!
the counterpoint to this would be "if we are headed down this path, and we all know it's going to suck, why put more fuel on the fire?"
you have to understand the fucked up position we are in, it's the end result of decades of fucked up gambles akin to the trump election, and the tory party are in blood stepped in so far that should they wade no more, returning would be as tedious as going on.
the torys have spent years blaming europe for all their woes, they knew that it was bollocks, but it's great to have a higher power you can scapegoat.
this lead to factions of their party splitting off and forming other parties.
(failed gamble 1) to reunite they claim to support having a stronger line with europe that might include exit, they offer a referendum as something that can be negotiated away in the hung parliament they are expecting, they don't get a hung parliament.
(failed gamble 2) they offer a lacklustre support for europe so they don't damage their base, knowing that exiting europe would be a terrible idea, and surely everybody else would see that.
(gamble 3) boris gambles that the tory party will see him as a great leader if he leads the anti-europe cause, but he doesn't expect to win.
(gamble 4) they are wrong, the leave campaign scrapes in.
now they have an option to fuck themselves politically and fracture the party by ignoring the public vote, causing the skeptics to leave and form a new party, or embrace what the public said and fuck the country.
ironically the leader of the opposing team is a brexiter, but keeps his party line of being pro-europe, so there isn't a viable political party who isn't brought in to exit.
in this environment, who has the balls to research whether we are going to be fucked or royally fucked, they aren't going to reverse brexit whatever the answer.
it's a bit like saying the fcc should wait till the petitions mess is sorted out, they're not going to do that because they never wanted to ask people in the first place, so why prolong the agony?
&gt; the torys have spent years blaming europe for all their woes ... and the 'previous government'.
i get so sick of that.
there should be a law where you can only blame your predecessor for a year after you enter parliament.
&gt; there should be a law where you can only blame your predecessor for a year after you enter parliament.
reminds me of an old joke.
legend has it when the us government changes hands, the outgoing potus leaves three letters in three sealed and numbered envelopes, and tells his successor to open one whenever he comes across a crisis he can't solve.
the first letter says "call a press conference and blame me."
the second says "reorganize your cabinet."
the third says "write three letters."
&gt; now they have an option to fuck themselves politically and fracture the party by ignoring the public vote, causing the skeptics to leave and form a new party, or embrace what the public said and fuck the country.
won't the party be fucked nonetheless?
the party that *could have* reversed a process so many people knew would screw the country but didn't because they tried to save face is not a great one to follow.
is it?
"we followed the will of the people" "brexit means brexit" pick any episode of question time and they always start with a quote like this from both sides if they are asked /any/ question about europe.
&gt;the counterpoint to this would be "if we are headed down this path, and we all know it's going to suck, why put more fuel on the fire?"
because these types of assessments aren't just 'should or shouldn't we do this', they also provide data on what steps you should be taking to prepare for the consequences of the action.
in essence, they just admitted they're flying into incredibly complex economic negotiations blind.
good summary.
yep, it's only how badly we've self-harmed that's still to be revealed.
it amazes me how similar the us and uk conservatives work.
they create a boogeyman and rally their base around hating it.
once it comes to a head and they get the keys to the car they just freeze up and are like, no we don’t actually want to solve the pretend problem we made up, we just want to keep using it for easy votes.
because if the boogeyman goes away, the people will start asking for things.
inconvenient things.
expensive things.
when the wolf isn't growling at the door, they can turn around and ask why the oven isn't burning, why the floor is cracked, why the pantry has no food in it, and why the bed has no blankets on it.
sounds like a tactic i pulled in elementary school when i didn't do the assigned homework.
the fact that farage waved goodbye after his victory, says enough about the fact how unfeasible this plan is.
when boris bailed i just thought it was one man with tiny testicles.
when farage went i realised it was plague infected rats fleeing the titanic... no, you're not paying attention here, clearly nothing was censored because it didn't exist in the first place, see parliament is far more competent than that.
it's not parliament that did this.
it went a little something like this (hit it.)
govt: the opposition is full of shit, we've done the reports and we can prove it.
parliament: oh really, show us the reports then.
govt: no.
parliament: do it or we'll arrest you for contempt of parliament and you will theoretically go to the tower and await execution - i mean probably not, but the papers will have fun with it.
govt: here is secret access to the papers under heavy security provided by a secretive massive contractor who also provide all our money.
parliament: this is just some photocopies and some general spreadsheets.
govt: fooled you.
parliament: you have lied to us.
now we're going to have to decide wether to have you arrested for that.
govt: we're so strong and stable it hurts.
england is my city.
dab on the haters.
it does mean someone, somewhere, gambled that they could say 'we can prove xyz with this report' and no-one would ask to see that report.
and we voted in these fucktards?
&gt;there is evidence of wmds in iraq -the not too distant past.
sounds eerily similar to our (americans) situation regarding the tax "reform" legislation debacle we have going on.
every partisan and non-partisan group has released their reports so far.
the majority and realistically the most dependable reports indicate it's going to fuck us real hard.
the treasury secretary however has been saying for months that they're working on their own report that will prove their claims about the legislation.
to this day, after our senate passed it, no report has been produced by our treasury nor does it seem that any report was commissioned or ever worked on.
now as it happens the head of the treasury is a trump appointed official so i guess you can see therein lies the rub.
this is such a perfect summary it simultaneously makes me happy and disappointed.
parliament: what if the haters dab back?
govt: no-one can hate this government.
it's impossible.
we've got boris the lovable clown from hignfy.
thank you, good summary yes, minister.
surely the reports were censored because they all showed what a ripping success brexit will be and if they'd released the report then we'd have been overrun with immigrants wanting a piece of our glory.
everyone with as little a bachelors in economics can tell you what the research will say, even if they can't tell you the actual numbers.
they're not doing the research because its politically damaging for them to have to release the obvious results.
what did you think all the porn they've found was?
seems to me that they did a lot of research.
we're going to get pounded in style.
so he flat out lied, which isn't just disgusting and an affront to the people of the uk who are on this insane rollercoaster, but also literally against the ministerial code.
he should resign.
i really, really wish all this nonsense would go away.
it's going nowhere good.
surely he's held in contempt.
either way pmqs are gonna be lit edit: sadly it was not lit.
cornyn failed to hold her to account yet again i don't know.
i've given up any hope of the conservative party playing by the rules.
seems like may is willing to do anything to stay in power, even if it means letting her mps run rampant.
corbyn has barely asked a single brexit question in months!
&gt;he should resign.
none of these grubby snakes are going to resign.
we have to remove them.
*the slowest of slow claps* as 'twas prophesied in *black adder* iv, "dress it up with any amount of pompous* verbal diarrhea you like, it's 'squareheads down for the big boche gang-bang'."
[edit: i just got autocorrected from 'pompous' to 'pomps'.
what in the actual fuck.]
and to the little fellow, if you get lonely at night i'm in the big château, no pressure.
i was at a conference in dc that dealt with international chemical regulations.
one of the presentations was on the ramifications of brexit.
it was astounding how many unknowns there were.
for example, if you want to introduce a product containing a new substance for sale in the eu, you need an entity based in the eu to introduce and represent your substance.
the uk was a critical english-speaking gateway to the eu, and many american businesses used the uk as a jumping off point, or gateway, for selling to the rest of the eu.
welp, that incentive vanished with last year’s vote.
another example, the uk has been part of the eu’s chemical testing, assessment, and reporting programs, which have generated innumerable data on toxicological characteristics of chemicals used in products.
the uk will be cut out of this database and out of future toxicological assessments.
to do this alone is a huge undertaking.
that was when it hit me.
the uk has relied on the eu for so much over the recent decades that some of their own internal programs have atrophied.
when brexit occurs it’s going to be like waking up as patient who has been in a coma for 15-years, rolling off the side of the bed, and deciding you’re going to walk out for the hospital and continue your life as it was 15 years ago.
they will fall as soon as their feet hit the floor, and will have to crawl, slowly and painfully out of the hospital.
it’s going to be a long, expensive, and mistake-ridden walk.
it's possible we could be cut off from the eu nuclear agency and medical supplies would be cut off.
we could also be cut off from aircraft bodies and no planes could fly in or out.
what is worse is the supply chain our industry operates with is so integrated with the eu that it could absolutely fuck uk manufacturing.
often one product will go through a few european countries before finishing.
there was one example of engine casings.
they were cast in the uk, then went to italy, back to the uk, on to germany, back to the uk for finishing and then were sold to france.
that's going to be interesting with no customs union one of the top comments on the bbc article about this: &gt;are you remainers really that stupid.
impact assessments only proved if you can see the future.
business will have already done their own and will be preparing for future world trades it is what business do.
get a grip and stop listening to bbc fake news.
grow up and accept democracy has spoken, this country is leaving the eu.
you do not get a 2nd go to get the answer you want.
comments like this are beyond exasperating.
first off, yes, many businesses will be doing their own assessments of what's to come, and it never seems to be good from what i read.
in the sector in which i work, we get reps from suppliers and other related companies coming into our office all the time.
they're all shitting themselves.
they say the market prices for everything from europe is already going straight up in anticipation of us leaving and it's only going to get worse, so they're having to buy and import from china at greater prices and inferior quality than we have now (though less than the new european costs) and at *much* greater lead times.
they expect it to only get worse, and it's killing profit margins.
the idea behind people not being allowed to change their minds is also ridiculous.
i voted remain because it seemed clear that nobody had a clue what would happen and my fears are panning out.
that said, i completely understand that a lot of people were swayed by the lies about additional nhs funding etc, which turned out - *on the day of the vote results* - to have been bullshit.
that, plus the impending price rises of many things and chronic uncertainty about the future of the country gives people every right to change their minds, in my humble opinion.
i accept that a second vote isn't going to happen, but the attitude of *"we won you lost, everything is going fine and nothing is going wrong, just deal with it asshole"* that most people who voted to leave seem to have is infuriating sometimes.
&gt;you do not get a 2nd go to get the answer you want.
by that logic the uk already had one referendum on the eu so there can be no vote to overturn that decision so brexit is null and void.
oh *shit* &gt; "impact assessments only proved if you can see the future."
oh my god.
i wish i could run my projects like this you can - once.
"i did my due diligence, terry, if you jump out of that window you will break both of your legs."
"you can see into the future?"
says terry and jumps out of the window.
ah, but you see, when terry jumps and breaks one leg, his hip, and his shoulder, he exposes you for the fool you truly are!
*attaching cervical collar* oh terry, you card!
[in that train of logic , i'm all for making this obviously fine and very real woman the head of the brexit negotiations team, hell she would even do a better job as pm.
](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zbbbi7rdvao/to2zs1ufv9i/aaaaaaaaajk/oraxyg6cr3u/s1600/fortune02antique.jpg) my boss: “so, onceadeafmute, you are proposing a pretty big change in how we run this particular part of our business, this could be pretty costly.
do you have that impact assessment of how this could look at the end of us implementing the change?.” onceadeafmute: “no, and really they are only proved if you can see the future, sooooo.....yeahhhh.” my boss: “......get out.” out of interest how much education is done in schools in the uk on the eu and what it actually does?
to be honest mate, i'm not even sure how many stars there are on the flag... so like, fuck all i guess.
pretty much none... history pretty much stops at world war 2 as war as high school education is concerned.
i finished school (sixth form) in 2014 and can't remember ever getting taught anything at all about the eu.
"grow up and accept democracy has spoken", i am sure they have complained for years about being in europe.
why are we now not allowed to complain we are going to be coming out.
&gt; we won you lost eat my shit welcome to...america?
that's the response i got when i pointed out the numerous times the gop has basically excluded the dems from the legislative process entirely.
i am the only one who seems to think it ridiculous that "businesses will have already done their own and will be preparing for future world trades" (sorry i don't know how to format quotes) is somehow an acceptable reason.
it's just the same as the "oh, someone else will do it" mentality.
with such big stakes at hand, it is extremely disappointing that they are following such an approach.
i would have hoped they had done their own independent research so that they are clear to satisfactory standard what position the uk is in and what can reasonably be projected along a multitude of avenues.
doing their own reports and research inherently shows that they have at the very least, put effort into exploring all available options.
it baffles me how the government can you go into such important negotiations relying on information that they themselves produced.
businesses, yes they do their own.
from every business source i have heard, their plans for future trade include moving sizeable chunks of their business elsewhere.
with that already part of their contingency backup plans should nothing finite be announced before anything is even effective.
this news sounds like the government has just prepared for 1 outcome rather than preparing for multiple eventualities, which just screams foolishness and immense arrogance.
brexit was never about the economy.
it was about xenophobia and british exceptionalism.
the idea that the exceptional uk won't benefit from not being dragged down by eu and immigrants is dead on arrival.
because it's an opinion without reason.
and you generally can't reason with people on opinions they hold without reason.
this issue is mostly emotional, and to reach people on that kind of issues, you primarily need to argue for emotional effect.
this is for instance the reason it has such effect when the brexiters scream about fear mongering at any mention of even the possibility of economic negative results.
the reasonable argument loses to the emotional argument.
the problem is that few people are emotionally vested in eu to nearly the same degree they are to their country.
there's a reason ol' nigel and some more top brexiteers quit after they won the referendum.
they didn't have anything but emotion to run on and that's not going to help you much when you actually have to do something.
this is so true, and ironically infuriating.
how do you argue with people and politicians that state "we have had enough of experts"?
the remain side didn't have flashy slogans or half baked promises and ideas, it had a boring list of solid reasons why this probably isn't a good idea.
the other side even came up with remoaners (which was a hammer blow!).
they had an emotional campaign on fear and blamed remoaners for project fear.
they had the sound bites we had boring stats.
and trying to convince anyone they were wrong is impossible as they simply dismiss anything you say a project fear.
this is far more worrying than brexit itself.
half a country of people that refuse to even contemplate any other narrative than their own.
each uk bureaucrat in eu spares us 2. eu protects our borders beyond our own.
every pound we spend on eu has greater returns than anything else we can spend it on.
we make more money trading with eu than the rest of the world put together.
(i'm not actually sure this is true, but i bet it's close.)
eu makes a lot of things easier for a lot of people.
the open border in northern ireland is one example.
eu is an added guarantee not just for human rights, but also for the individual rights of all uk citizens.
eu has elevated consumer rights in several respects.
eu is the leading voice for global peace and prosperity, and leading by example.
eu is the biggest force working against systematic international tax evasion and of multinational companies.
eu is voluntary and very democratic, with great respect for the interests of each member state.
there is no comparison either internationally or in history.
these are just what i could immediately think of.
the wording may need some polishing.
hahahahahaha kill me hahahaha &gt;it doesn't matter, nothing matters, we don't care, consequences are irrelevant, we've been waiting 30 years for this, we got a few useful idiots to lie to you and you voted accordingly, it's happening on any terms because this is our moment and literally nothing else matters whatsoever.
hey, how do you know when you're dealing with an ideologue?
you ask them a tricky question and they respond with etymology.
&gt; you ask them a tricky question and they respond with *inept* etymology.
ftfy.
heh.
yep, thanks.
the 'inept' is probably implicit these days but of course westminster isn't what it once was.
when boris johnson can style himself as a dangerous intellectual among his peers, nothing is out of bounds.
sounds awfully like the australian government, aren’t we all so similar!
... :( i know shamefully little about australian politics (other than that your parliament just enacted marriage equality, which is great imo) but that's not a surprise to hear.
we are indeed all so similar.
it's like... okay, a lot of politicians will just not answer questions.
they'll evade or ignore them.
theresa may does it constantly, because she's basically not intelligent enough to juggle nasty questions from her own party and nasty questions from anyone else at the same time.
but the whole brexit fiasco is basically defined by (a) lies, and (b) bull-headed ideology.
the real hard wing of the tory party just simply don't care about the consequences so long as the main one is "we left the eu".
it's absurd because cameron did a great job of that juggling act... until he suddenly shot himself in the foot in the most fucking ridiculous way possible.
&gt;(other than that your parliament just enacted marriage equality, which is great imo) nope, we have had 10 years of polls indicating that australian's support marriage equality.
so instead of listening to the people, the government proposed a non-binding public vote where a large number of politicians stated that they wouldn't follow through with a yes vote.
the vote would cost over $100m, mental health and advocacy groups both warned that the debate would have an adverse effect on the wellbeing of lgbt+ groups.
one former prime minister was headbutted, the nephew of another former prime minister was beaten up, old people were told by the murdoch press that boys would be forced to dress like girls and that schools would start teaching primary school kids (5-12 years old) how to use dildos, the australian football league had a bomb threat in their hq and many family relationships were strained across the nation all so that we could discuss how we could best "preserve australian values".
the public vote meant also that the government ~~had to~~ was going to give money to debaters from both sides to advertise their arguments, and now we have seen the introduction of american neo-con conspiracies like "the gay agenda" into our common national lexicon.
this $100m vote has also come after years of austerity measures, where politicians have told us repeatedly that we can't afford to pay our teachers/scientists/national-broadcasters.
that vote came back with 133 electorates voting yes to 17 voting no at a time where the government has had ~~30+~~ 21 (ty u/smoha96 + u/kroxigor01) consecutive polls state they will lose the next election.
we are now undergoing debates where politicians are trying to decide whether we should include rights for cake makers to discriminate against gay people in the new marriage laws.
now we have realised that homophobes are a minority in this country, a whole bunch of our politicians are suddenly on board with protecting minorities.
also, some have said that maybe we could just have two types of marriage, one for straight people and one for gay people (we already had civil unions).
**edit** on the note of federal funding.
&gt;while a compulsory legislated plebiscite would have seen up to $10 million in government funding given to the respective 'yes' and 'no' sides, attorney-general george brandis confirmed this week that it was "not anticipated" any public funding would be granted in the case of a postal plebiscite.
nonetheless, immense amounts of money -- through private donations and fundraising -- will fuel a big ad campaign from both sides, predicted by veteran political strategist bruce hawker to be up to $60 million in total.
[\[source\]](http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/08/10/big-ad-agencies-wont-do-ads-for-plebiscite-no-campaign_a_23074245/) i'm sorry, i misunderstood.
i can see this is a matter close to your heart; it's close to mine too (albeit in a different country).
i was under the impression that a bill had been passed but from what you're saying obviously it hasn't yet.
is it likely that these assorted delaying tactics will actually affect the judgement?
we haven't quite enacted marriage equality yet, but hopefully by the end of the week.
but we do have lots of politicians lying, avoiding questions, and turning a blind eye to their hypocrisy because it would admit a flaw in their ideology.
how the fuck are they still allowed to carry on like this?
all other mp's are just watching this shitshow happen so they can attack the tories in the next general election when they fuck it up.
they need to do something about it now for fuck's sake it's never about the people, just getting in power.
it's absolutely pathetic, been this way for decades "x person needs to give an answer on how to fix this to get votes" next day "x person has said he'll fix this by doing this".
seriously it's talk about what the voters wanna hear but never actually follow through.
they literally can't do anything about it because tories+dup = a majority.
meanwhile the dup have just thrown away an opportunity to turn belfast into a major commercial hub for eu-uk business for... reasons?
i swear there's something dodgy going on with that party.
great example of politicians prioritizing winning over doing the right thing for their country.
what an embarrassment this whole charade has been *sigh* as an american i wish you wouldn't say that, because i dread my government's inevitable follow up of "you think that's embarrassing?
hold my beer" trump's riling up the middle east over jerusalem as we speak.
give him back his beer, quick!
oh god, what has reddit done!
good news!
the uk government may of not done an impact report but the eu did - http://www.europarl.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/en/ukevents/brexit/brexitstudies.html the eu has done loads of them.
its as if they had experts working on this, and not the equivalent of an elementary school debating team.
don't you remember that people are tired of experts?/s [deleted] do you know the genuine reason why?
when a nation joins the eu, all of its trade and economic negotiators/lawyers are seconded to the eu.
those that remain can be downsized by the national government.
we are literally arguing against our own best and brightest.
they have a full house and we are holding a pair of jokers.
&gt;they have a full house and we are holding a pair of jokers.
b-b-but "they need us more than we need them.
just.
walk.
away.
every other counry in the world can't wait to deal with us and there will be absolutely no way they'll want a compromise that benefits them more" /s, obviously.
i don’t even think it’s a pair, you have one joker from another deck and a mars bar wrapper with “rule britannia” scribbled on it in finger paint.
that's why the "eu isn't transparent"-criticism bothers me so much.
the eu shares basically every single report they have on their website.
yup.
they are more transparent than the uk government is.
another annoying one is "unelected".
we elect our meps just like we elect our mps.
if anything it is *more* elected and representative than the uk government as the european council is made up of heads of state that we also elected... whereas the second chamber of uk government isn't elected *at all*.
wow there, when i was in my elementary school debating team we did do research and based our arguments on facts never mind.
not every debating team can afford a bus.
but that's not what the side of the bus told me!
bus wankers friend!
ooh, brexit friend!
[deleted] i saw a bus that said batman v superman was a good movie, so i'm starting to think that everything written on the side of a bus is a lie.
(i stole that joke and haven't even seen any dc movies) what bus?
you must have imagined it.
never happened.
boris said so.
show any of this to a brexiter and they'll consider scaremongering while a lack of documents from the uk is holding their cards close to the chest not to let the eu know if they have power over us or not.
honestly the dm comments section has just resorted to saying that britain needs bulldog spirit on the road ahead.
they know bulldogs tend to suffocate as they get older right?
so they literally die.
not sure that's the kinda spirit i want, unless they intend to destroy the uk and everybody goes their own way.
'can people really be this stupid?'
*walks to british library; consults codex stultorum* 'hmm.
it says here they can.'
so....general election for christmas?
between this incompetence and the dup being the dup, i don't see the british government lasting.
eh, it's easier to wait until brexit is done, pin the blame on someone else and then grab power.
teresa may is sticking around because nobody else has any clue what to do either.
strong and stable............................ this sounds terrifying.
why is no one terrified?
it's alright friend.
i'm terrified too.
the truth is brexit is such a fucking complicated mess of issues the general public doesn't really have the time or investment to understand it all properly and i think they're going to be ignorant to the outcomes until they're directly, negatively affected by them - at which point they'll again believe whoever offers them the simplest scapegoat.
like we did with europe.
which is why we either shouldn't have the referendum in the first place, or at least not acted like it's legally fucking binding.
we literally pay politicians to navigate these complicated, often purposely-obfuscating issues because the public just doesn't have the time to do it.
the acting like it's legally binding was probably because they couldn't come up with a strong enough argument to not follow a majority vote.
albeit a marginally majority which shouldn't even really be considered a majority given the topic at hand, but that's a whole other argument.
there should never even have been a referendum, the general public are never really gonna be able to make a decision like this.
it was just a shameless power move by someone that fucked off as soon as it backfired.
i just can't believe that such a giant change can be made with a 52-48 split.
i always assumed that this kind of thing needed like 66.6% or something there was a "gentleman's agreement" that the majority needed to be 55% for parliament to consider it.
i absolutely know the libdems were for the 55% majority, but no one else kept up with the agreement.
&gt; why is no one terrified?
too busy being in wild disbelief and puzzlement.

&gt; it's like being terrified by satire - doesn't quite work unless you realise it's reality.
or unless you have the imagination to realise how easily it *could* be so.
this whole thing is like looking at an out-of-control train speeding down the tracks.
you know that it is going to crash and that people will get hurt and you sympathize with the passengers but you are helplessly watching on the sidelines.
you watch with horrifying clearness how the train crew is doing anything but trying to slow the thing down or even try to get a bearing on their situation.
and then you think about how the passengers just sit there and don't do anything (besides complaining a bit) about the train crew that took switched off all the safety systems because they had made a quick survey among the passengers and most of them that answered said "just turn at the next signal" when they had no clue where this would leave them.
you don't know if the passengers will throw their crew off the train and if they can figure out a way to stop the train before the big crash.
and while the train conductor of another yuge train is cheering them on and maybe is sending his thoughts and prayers you are just shaking your head.
sad and powerless to stop such idiocy.
best of luck to you.
we are the dumb being led by the blind.
i've lived in the uk for 6 years now, and brexit has been the second worst thing that happened to me here (the first one is the two, hot and cold taps) thought i couldn't be surprised anymore about this shit show.
how absolutely fucking terrifying.
the eu must be on the floor in tears at this news.
insane!!
remember folks, the tories are the party of economic credibility.
play stupid games win stupid prizes i'd like to stop playing this game and go on the merry-go-round.
*hurriedy applies for jobs in germany* i'll be watching you from an efficient carousel, glühwein in hand.
prost!
*continues drinking frantically* question here.
what would happen to a person who failed to do their job and lied about doing said job?
the become chief of ministry of brexit.
miniplenty.
the thing is, in the house of commons, he said there were impact studies.
now he’s saying there aren’t?
they must paint such a fucking horrific future for the u.k., post brexit, that he can’t possibly show them.
meanwhile the eu has carried out 47 (that they've made publicly available).
honestly, how can the house of lords not halt brexit and call for a second vote to take place **after** an impact assessment has been done and published?
i can't see how the public's interests could be preserved without doing so because the house of lords don't have the power to do that.
they can request amendments to bills, but they cannot prevent the will of the commons.
this government will go down in infamy.
conservatives have been operating on a system of self-preservation over what is good for the country.
david cameron only entertained the idea of a referendum because he didn’t think he/the tories would get elected otherwise.
what’s worse?
they succumbed to ukip who for all their bluster are a fringe party, with outcasts for members.
the uk has set itself on fire and cast itself adrift.
this government will never be forgiven ... shame on them, shame on those who vote tory and shame on the right wing british press.
it’s suicide.
can't they just admit that the whole ordeal was a terrible idea and give up on it?
yolo!
~ british government if you listen very carefully late in the evening you can hear the gentle crunch of our country collectively slamming its balls in a draw.
remember guys, it's not.
'the most stupid and puerile political decision in a generation', it's 'sovereignty'.
fucking tories.
if the last few years have taught us anything, it's that dishonesty is now so ingrained in our society, that you can literally write a lie of the side of a bus, drive it around the country, and you'll get away with it.
wants to ink a deal for bp... this is the best tl;dr i could make, [original](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/07/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-boris-johnson-expected-to-go-to-tehran-this-weekend) reduced by 89%.
(i'm a bot) ***** &gt; johnson, making his first visit to tehran as foreign secretary, will also seek to put anglo-iranian relations on a new footing, pointing to the uk&amp;#039;s strong defence of the iranian nuclear deal signed in 2015.
&gt; johnson met zaghari-ratcliffe&amp;#039;s husband last month and apologised if his remarks in parliament could have been construed by the iranian judiciary as a sign that she had been in tehran on anything other than a holiday.
&gt; most uk banks fear they will face swingeing fines by us federal authorities if it emerges they funded a commercial deal between firms and an iranian entity banned under us sanctions, such as the irgc.
ownership laws in tehran are opaque, and determining whether an irgc firm has only a minority stake in a company is hard.

better send jared completely avoidable.
this is so disgusting.
thanks, us.
great contribution.
blame us all you want you worthless cunt.
you just hate us cause you ain’t us.
did you find it easy to make the transfer from cyrillic alphabet?
also, reported, take that language elsewhere.
i cannot believe that a democracy can accept a mentally ill person to start a war like this.
your weak mind and weak nation will always blame the mighty powerful us for everything.
you will never be important and you will contribute to anything.
i defend our actions sometimes even though the current administration is mostly fumbling important decisions.
when i see citizens comment like this it does make people from other countries dislike the us and thus makes discourse difficult.
in this case it seems to be bait but you should know everyone has an effect... weak mind?
have a look at what you just wrote, you are totally brainwashed.
so it brought his chances of winning from 99% to 99.9%?
well then, shame on the ioc for enabling him /s yeah, came here with this exact same thought.
"oh, gee, putin sure was in reelection trouble before **this** helped him out..." banning russia from the olympics is still the right thing to do.
i hate this "lets tip toe around russia or else they might do something bad to us" mentality.
they're still the bad guy no matter how you spin it.
they are not the bad guy;..they are just a guy in a world full of bad guys... it’s not all equal.
we can’t pretend canada and north korea are the same, or that russia and us are the same.
maybe uk and france are basically as bad, but calling it all equal is nihilistic and diminishes meaningful differences and the (often easy) policy changes that can bring them about.
this should really clinch it for putin.
it was really going to be a close “election” before this.
&gt; the world is against us if they can't respond to reason then maybe we should be.
what kind of government doesn't respect regulations and the law?
the world is against putin and his corruption.
not the russian people.
if russians were smart, they would vote putin out *because* the world is against him and he's bad for russia.
after the treaty of versailles imposed hardship on the german people, it gave rise to nationalism and nazism, not made the germans "smart" i said *if* they were smart.
of course it wont make them smart, but you can't help the helpless, either.
without cooperation on their end all we can do is leave them to their own devices.
also, the nazi's had to be forcefully removed from power.
and frankly i think we're just postponing the inevitable with russia.
they deserve to be called out on their bs, and if that leads to further tensions, that's on them for being bullies.
a comment such as this makes me feel threatened and i want to go vote for putin.
why would a comment like this make you feel threatened?
because its true, or because it hurts your feelings?
cuz i got news for you buddy, your feelings don't make it less true.
us doing our own thing is not a reason for you to feel threatened, unless you're willing to admit that you need us, in which case stop threatening us and respect the rules like everyone else.
its not like the rules are unreasonable.
they're agreed on to begin with.
the lesson here is that russia needs to stop lying, to the world and to their people, and the russian people need to stop flocking to snake oil salesmen every time their feelings get hurt.
its a two way street and both parties are at fault.
all we in the west can do about it is insulate ourselves from it.
do you live in russia or know what life is like?
it makes me feel threatened, because in one sentence you said russia would have to be dealt with, and nazies were removed by force, implying that removing a foreign government by force is ok with you.
it is not, if i had to choose between putin and a foreign interference, i'd choose putin, no matter how much i dislike what his junta does to my country.
on the other note, i definitely agree that the rules have to be followed, with one major footnote - they have to be applied to everyone, and not selectively.
what i see happen for the past 25 years is that the application of international law is definitely not universal.
oh, and on the snake oil man - it's the americans who elected one and who is now prepared to let the world go up in flames, not us, buddy.
&gt; implying that removing a foreign government by force is ok with you it is if they're actively trying to destabilize our way of life.
if you did your thing and we did our thing, that would be fine by me.
but that's not whats happening is it?
russia lies and cheats to get on top.
they don't play a fair game, and thats because their national identity is one giant battle-axe culture inferiority complex.
you're even trying to make the argument that not paying attention to you is threatening to you.
you'll use whatever whataboutism to spin any offense in a way that reinforces your confirmation bias.
how could you not when you're spoon fed misinformation.
and those aren't just assumptions.
you're demonstrating this.
if russia continues to interfere in us, british, and spanish politics, among countless others through targeted misinformation campaigns, [literally inciting violence and anarchy in other countries](http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/31/media/russia-facebook-violence/index.html), then they are an active threat.
&gt; i definitely agree that the rules have to be followed, with one major footnote - they have to be applied to everyone, and not selectively.
russia has been paying off these parties for years.
the olympics, fifa and other international sporting events are themselves corrupt.
and russia has been repeatedly exposed multiple times on this with few repercussions.
banning russia is one step towards righting wrongs committed on both sides.
but they are still undoubtedly among the worst perpetrators for doping.
spoken like a true bully, yelling "don't hit me!"
as he pummels his fist into his victim's face.
are you insinuating that anything i said above is wrong?
telling someone they're wrong is not an attack.
sometimes its the truth.
at least if you can support your statements it is.
and lets be honest, if you could have you would have.
nice attempt at trying to spin this to make you seem like the victim though.
especially when i was essentially making an argument for sovereignty.
does us doing our own thing (and having integrity while we do it) really piss russia off that much?
please tell me again how: &gt; its not like the rules are unreasonable.
they're agreed on to begin with.
is comparable to punching my fists into my victims face?
ladies and gentlemen, i think we found our russian troll.
&gt; and frankly i think we're just postponing the inevitable with russia.
they deserve to be called out on their bs, and if that leads to further tensions, that's on them for being bullies.
i was not aware that this wasn't stated in particular by you.
as i said, a bully launches an attack whilst hiding behind the mantle of "justice".
but that's not an attack.
if they're bull shitting and lying, then they deserve to be called out on it.
its called having integrity.
you don't tolerate someone's lies because it would hurt their feelings to be honest.
they're still creating conflict by lying.
so don't accuse me of hiding behind a mantle of justice when you're using cyclical logic to re-frame yourself as the victim.
frankly i think that statement speaks for itself.
if calling russia out on its lies leads to further tensions, they have only themselves to blame.
this is what happens when you constantly criticise a country - the signal gets lost in the noise.
why would russians vote him out to please some other country?
he's been good for russians living in russia, and frankly, people care more about their own day to day life than what other countries think of their president.
he's been good to oligarchs.
but corruption is bad for everyone.
it makes your streets less safe, and your institutions less reliable.
even the news is fake in russia.
bwahaha.
"streets less safe".
nice joke, man.
in glorious democratic yeltsin times there were open shootings on the streets, every business was paying to local gang, you was able to buy drugs almost openly and average salary was $50.
now there is oligarchs getting their big money, yes, but for ordinary people life is much better.
better than hell?
would i be safe walking down those streets as an openly gay man with attractive features and long hair?
give me a break.
better does not mean good.
and how is it bad attitude towards lgbt is putin fault?
you do understand that it's actually other way around, he reacted to russian people wishes.
and all this attempts from west to push more liberal views are considered just enemy propaganda and attack on traditional values so it just boost putin popularity?
gay people *are* russian people.
minority of russian people.
and democracy is rule of the majority.
democracy must also protect minorities.
you're referring to utilitarianism.
well, we discuss russia.
not the best example of democracy... exactly, people in eastern europe (it's not just russia btw) see lgbt propaganda either as western subversion intended to weaken their societies or at best as a decadent feature of western culture that is best avoided.
and it actually has little to do with bigotry, as religious levels were fairly low until recently, and even now the religious motivation behind this attitude is at best a secondary factor.
if it wasn't for all the lgbt bs being shoved down their throats they would probably be much more accepting to it.
a lot of very big music and movie stars are actually quite openly/visibly gay, it has not hurt their popularity at all.
it's when it comes to things like undermining family and societal cohesion that the backlash begins.
yet most russians trust him and he has done great work for the russian population.
i'm not saying he's a great guy.
but considering all things and putting me in the shoes of a russian then i would maybe still vote for him anyway.
this tactic works really well though.
we are seeing the rest of the world work towards bypassing the us any way they can because of trumps words and actions but when we start feeling the consequences of those words and actions, do you think for a second that trump supporters will blame trump?
they will rally harder and blame the rest of the world for not putting up with our shit.
who should we vote for instead?
yeah, right americna athlete get to use steriods for asthma, virtigo and all sorts of bullshit and no one bats and eye... there is no reason in an international game where one country is excluded because of geopolitics... double standard has no reason i get the feeling it doesn't matter which way the product vote.
he could get one and still "win".
this story.
my wife is russian, i'm american and we often "discuss" russian politics.
she doesn't like the impact putin has had on the working people of russia who are more poor and destitute than they were before him.
but stories like the olympic one make her feel that putin is the only 1 who can stand up to the rest of the world.
most russians are willing to accept the standard level of corruption if they feel they are made safer.
she feels the reason russia cannot participate in the next olympics has nothing to do with (faked) drug tests, and more to do with the world being threatened by how much better russia is at sports.
she also believes there are no russians in ukraine, the chinese are taking over siberia and draining it of natural resources, and that the soviets did not lose the cold war economically.. they just made a choice to go a different direction.
are you comparing it to ussr when working class was on par with everyone else?
cause in the 90s working people had it a lot worse than now.
&gt; ussr when working class was on par with everyone else typical communist lies.
nomenklatura received goods in high priority while majority of people couldn't afford anything above shittiest food and simplest clothing.
simple people in moscow don't count, they were privileged caste too.
no one will think that you are smart if you use scary words like nomenklatura, maskirovka or kgb.
there wasn’t such inequality and factory worker could afford going to crimea or sochi for a vacation, send kids to pioneer camp or whatever.
i wouldn't be so sure about russia being so much better at sports than everyone else.
it was their poor performance at the vancouver games that set off a chain of events culminating in the doping program so they could appear dominant at sochi.
you should watch the documentary "icarus" on netflix, it's a real eye-opener.
source: am russian.
your wife doesnt know what the hell she is talking about, i dont think she is very smart or informed.

(i'm a bot) ***** &gt; a ban on russia taking part in the winter olympics is likely to make support for him even stronger, by uniting voters around his message: the world is against us.
&gt; with ties between the kremlin and the west at their lowest point for years, the international olympic committee&amp;#039;s decision to bar russia from the 2018 pyeongchang games over doping is seen in moscow as a humiliating and politically tinged act.
&gt; casting the ioc ban as a western plot to hurt russia, something he did when russian athletes were banned from last year&amp;#039;s summer olympics in rio over doping, could help him mobilize the electorate.

"petcoke" sounds like either a soft drink for pets or cocaine for pets.
pokemon, fire type.
is the hip new thing in china.
quench your thirst and fuel your counterfeit hummer at the same time!
can we just ban the really bad stuff already?
do the richest companies in the world really need to sell the most polluting leftovers?
well they need to get rid of it.
why not get rid of it by selling it?
it's fucking horrible... but, you know, business.
petcoke is a byproduct at refineries, its going to be produced anyway, selling it as fuel to places that haven't banned it is arguably a sensible thing to do.
though not burning it would be best, if they are going to burn some other fossil fuel in its place then petcoke is actually the environmentally responsible choice.
just like deciding to start mining tarsands 10ish years ago, which produces much more of this stuff compared to crude, was the environmentally responsible choice i presume?
anyhow, they should better do some research to do much more pyrolysis of the heavier fractions it in stead of burning them off.
mining of oilsands started way more than 10 years ago.
sounds like an opportunity to make a lot of money if you take that up.
isn't capitalism great?
no, capitalism isn't great.
this is kind of a good example, where you only weigh the monetary gain, nothing else is worth measuring, fuck them all.
enough regulation on refineries will do the trick just fine, because they will not have any other choice then to take this more environmentally friendly but more complicated approach.
great work regulation man, now its cheaper to refine oil in other countries, you've put your domestic oil refineries out of business and now import oil from other nations.
always this same shortsighted rhetoric.
its always cheaper somewhere, whatever you do.
with that logic they were already gone anyways.
stop flinging shit like a brainwashedmonkey and do some research.
lighter fractions are more expensive/cumbersome to transport then the crude.
this is why refineries are relatively local anyways.
these kind of investments aren't even that important to their competitiveness.
there is only no incentive to make them.
there are plenty of successful examples of this kind of regulation where it worked, like sulfur content and cfk.
certain things are never for profit and should be handled by the government on that basis.
prisons also come to mind.
petcoke comes in two grades, one of which is not generally used as a fuel, but rather as anodes for the aluminium industry.
the 'fuel grade' contains problematic quantities of sulphur, which has to be removed before it is burnt.
the cost of shipping fuel coke to india, a major coal producer, is unlikely to be economic.
this is the best tl;dr i could make, [original](https://apnews.com/35ef0b0069064e6c948ee56a954886a5/india-to-phase-out-'petcoke'-imports-after-ap-investigation) reduced by 83%.
(i'm a bot) ***** &gt; new delhi - india&amp;#039;s government says it plans to phase out imports of a dirty fuel known as petroleum coke, or &amp;quot;petcoke,&amp;quot; after an associated press investigation found u.s. oil refineries are exporting vast quantities of the product to india.
&gt; the ap investigation found the u.s. sold about 20 times more petcoke to india last year than it did six years earlier after u.s. refineries struggled to sell the product at home.
&gt; &amp;quot;we are planning to implement a system to stop imports and use home-produced petcoke for non-polluting sectors, such as cement production,&amp;quot; pradhan said on saturday, according to the press trust of india news agency.

right.

hello world!
over the past few weeks, we have found a lot of posts that violate the rules of the sub and some even became quite popular.
what people fail to understand is that this a sub for things that only programmers would find humorous, not things that are funny because it happened to a programmer or was done by a programmer.
we would like to clarify some of the rules since we have received a lot of posts violating these recently: 0. about rule 0 - this rule essentially says that if you post is an image, the image itself should be about programming, not the caption, super-imposed text or the title of the post.
for a post to be considered on basis of the text, there needs to be enough text such that the image is just for formatting or emphasis.
so, memes like distracted boyfriend are not allowed regardless of the text is but expanding brain is allowed as long as text is programming related.
see [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmerhumor/comments/6jo5xq/meme_monday_1_20170626/dji05v6/?st=j6y9pftm&amp;sh=ae3cbe9e) for more reasons on why certain memes are allowed.
the sidebar also has further links explaining why this rule exists.
also, rule[0][1] is for posts that are images which are similar to some programming tool or concept (like places called vim, elevator buttons as arrays, 404 in the wild etc.)
and the title just explains that.
it is not meant for images where the analogy is forced purely through the superimposed text or title.
1. r/softwaregore posts - while there is a significant overlap in the audience of the two subs, there is not much overlap in the content.
posts like nan/null instead of values, javascript leaking into emails, error messages from apps, etc.
belong only on r/softwaregore.
the only two cases where they may be allowed here is if the software involved is primarily used by programmers (ides, version control software, etc.)
or the error message is funny or ironic.
this sub is about humor while building software, not while using it.
2. bad ui posts - related to the above, for a post to qualify as bad ui, it needs to be oc, preferably with source code in the comments.
bad ui found in the wild also belongs on r/softwaregore including password fields with weird rules, using a check box instead of radio buttons, etc.
exceptions may be made for some really over the top bad ui found in the wild, but don't count on it.
again, this sub is about humor while building software.
3. javascript and other language wat-ness - if op failed to understand some standard that the language has implemented, s/he will be humiliated.
seriously, fact check stuff before posting it here.
the rationale is that we want actual programmer humor to be the majority of the content in this sub, not low-effort posts which are better suited in other subs and mask actual programmer humor.
running gags and meta-posts are still fine since no one outside of this sub is likely to understand them.
some other subs that you might want to check out for memes and such are r/programme_irl, r/programmerreactions, r/prgmrshowerthoughts, r/programmerdadjokes and r/techhumor.
tl;dr - no image macros unless they follow [these](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmerhumor/comments/6jo5xq/meme_monday_1_20170626/dji05v6/?st=j6y9pftm&amp;sh=ae3cbe9e) rules and no error messages, shitty password requirements or nan/null on the website posts.
feedback is welcome.
[this comment was semi-automatically deleted by a semi-conscient perl script] oh boy here come the humor police &lt;/s&gt; &gt; the expanding brain has more text because it's verbose, but it conveys just as little information as the distracted boyfriend.
the point is not about how much information is conveyed, but where the humor lies in the post.
in expanding brain, the humor is in the creative ways to do something simple.
the brains could easily be replaced with some text like level 0 programmer, level 1 programmer, etc and the joke would still stand.
in distracted boyfriend, the humor lies in the image put in context of something else.
without that image, there is no joke being made.
running gags are part of the culture of this sub.
if we adhere to strict sense of "meme", most of the content of this sub will have to be removed.
&gt; by the way, i thought we had all agreed that memes would be restricted to mondays.
am i misremembering?
meme mondays were a catastrophic failure.
not only did people not post under the weekly thread, they kept posting memes all through the week.
so, we had to discontinue them.
if there is enough support from the community to make them work, we can restart those.
i'll update the css on the submission page.
we should have the rules on top.
i think you painted the distracted boyfriend with a brush too broad.
i can't find them now, but i did shitty examples that are technically alright.
i don't see any distinction between expanding brain and distracted boyfriend memes tbh.
in both cases, the image is only redundant when you already are familiar with the meme; distracted boyfriend is just more recent.
[here is an example, from "nondeterministic memes for np-complete teens"](https://i.imgur.com/qzza9vg.png) reformatting this joke as a text-only meme doesn't fundamentally change it, it just makes it less funny.
it'd be difficult to make most of these memes any less funny.
can there be a ban on low effort array indexing jokes?
i'm so sick of them and they're absolutely killing my enjoyment of this subreddit i concur, the 0th thing moderators should look for is abuse of this we're asked a lot to ban things like this because this sub loves to jump on a bandwagon (i love it, but that's putting it nicely.)
things end up dying down after a week or two, so it's tough to decide what is and isn't worth filtering or banning indefinitely.
the lowest of the low-effort renditions of these bandwagons already break rule 0 and are removed, and i tend to think that a set of consistently enforced rules that allow us some ability to remove the worst of these bandwagons is better than trying to play whack-a-mole with every new trend that pops up.
what about "omg guyz vim is hard to exiiiiit"?
that crops up every week, and people are literally recreating the same memes every time without adding any new twists.
it's just "here's my neighborhood pho place called vim.
i can never figure out how to get out!"
"here's my neighborhood nail studio called vim.
i can never figure out how to get out!"
"here's my neighborhood hunting shop called vim.
i can never figure out how to get out!"
these posts probably technically don't break any rules, they're just extremely repetitive and unfunny.
that's what downvoting is for.
moderation is to keep things on topic, voting is to represent interest or lack of interest.
i found the crappy ui things people were doing crappy after the first 2.
"yes, i get the damn joke, i don't care how creative your crappy volume slider is..." but i would never ask for them to be moderated out.
allow the community to decide within the realm of all on-topic content.
the problem is that this sub has become too popular.
ever since this place has gotten attention from /r/all, too many non-programmers have started posting and voting which has drowned out everyone else.
now all that gets upvoted is: "hello fellow it friends, cant exit vim amiright?"
still so after 70 days.
i wish there was a filter at least, i cant stand them.
maybe we could have a /r/shittyprogramerhumor for low quality shit.
like making jokes about spelling errers and shit.
under appreciated comment done: [r/shittyprogramerhumor](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmerhumor/) ☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜) that sub has already existed for around 3 years, and there's only one post...^^^^and ^^^^its ^^^^not ^^^^good /u/munirc, see if you can get /u/tynach to give us his sub.
or make a new sub without the misspelled name edit: it exists (/r/shittyprogrammerhumor) but the creator and only moderator has been inactive for 9 months.
:( inactive for more than a month means you can take it over via /r/redditrequest.
just did this, hopefully i can mod the sub and build it up, so we can shitpost there and keep the /r/programmerhumor mods happy.
update: just got the subreddit, been giving it a bit of a make over and giving it some of the spice of this sub.
come check it out /r/shittyprogrammerhumor if you do get the sub, i'd be happy to help moderate it.
update: i got it :) oh, fancy.
it's giving me a page not found... oops wrong sub /r/shittyprogrammerhumor **here's a sneak peek of /r/shittyprogrammerhumor using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/shittyprogrammerhumor/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all) of all time!

i noticed the spelling error after making it.
apparently you can't delete subreddits either, or i would have.
instead i just gave up.
i think the spelling error will go with the spirit of the sub.
:) i personally do not want to mod more than one sub, but wouldn't mind asking other mods here to help you and redirecting posts your way.
/r/programmercomedycemetery is more fitting imo.
are you planning to actually enforce the rules?
i actually hope so but i imagine it'd be quite a challenge and a lot of people might get unreasonably pissed off… imho even just getting rid of the worst examples would be a start.
it bothers me that this array of rules does not start at 0 it does, unless you turned off the subreddit style, or are on mobile (my bet is you are on mobile) hello citizen.
to accept the recalibration, please ensure that your device is capable and configured to accept subreddit .css.
if your device is capable, you can configure it to accept subreddit .css by going to preferences -&gt; display options and tick 'allow subreddits to show me custom themes'.
if you have the reddit enhancement suite (res) extension for your device, please ensure on the subreddit itself that you do not have 'use subreddit style' ticked off.
if your device is not capable, such as a mobile app or otherwise, the calibration will have to be applied mentally.
to do so meditate on this fact 0 = 1, 1 = 2, 2 = 3... until your brain has been properly reconfigured.
beware that mental readjustment can have unforeseen sideeffects on the users arithmetic abilities, or general sanity.
friend computer judges this an acceptable loss in non-essential cognitive capability of its subjects when the goal is to achieve compliance with subreddit protocol.
isn't it easier to just start numbering at 0 instead of doing a css trick?
doesn't work without css unfortunately...reddit's markdown rendering overrides it with numbered lists starting at 1. hmm, there seems to be a bug in the markdown rendering engine then it's been that way since day 0 here you go, send 'em a pull request: https://github.com/reddit/snudown ^^^pay ^^^no ^^^mind ^^^that ^^^the ^^^last ^^^commit ^^^was ^^^over ^^^2 ^^^years ^^^ago is that a bot no, it's a macro.
you need reddit mod toolbox to apply it easily ok thanks or res arrays begin at 1 confirmed i start mine at 2. to be honest, if content is even remotely related to programming, it should be allowed.
there's already enough rules that are to be followed when coding a program in any given language; this sub should act as a getaway for, both, light and technical humor.
i don't know how to tell you this, but i'm afraid our mod is javascript.
now you've gone too far.
&gt; so, memes like distracted boyfriend are not allowed regardless of the text is but expanding brain is allowed as long as text is programming related.
i read the link that follows in the sentence after this and i still don't understand the reasoning behind the distinction.
it seems arbitrary and doesn't help me understand where the line is for any meme other than those two.
why not just make the rule "no memes"?
they're both low quality, low effort posts.
why does the rule #0 even exist?
and this is why i stopped posting here.
i'm a programmer and you're a programmer.
there are some things related to programming that i might find funny and you might not.
just because of that, you can't say it's not programmer humor.
rules like these just seem like you want everyone to post what you think is programmer humor.
and that's not what a community is about.
but we are not discussing what is programmer humor and what isn't.
we are discussing what is the right content for this sub.
i find memes funny and i also like reaction posts.
but they do tend to drown the rest of the content, in whichever sub they are allowed.
r/funny doesn't allow memes for the same reason and i don't think people believe that memes aren't funny.
also, these aren't my rules.
these were created by the community through discussion.
see the links next to the rules in the sidebar.
these rules existed before i even became redditor, let alone becoming a mod here.
you are free to create your own sub like other people are proposing if you don't want to follow these rules.
it's a sub about programming humor, by virtue of discussion what 'belongs' on the sub, we're discussing what 'acceptable' programming humor is it seems to me.
i think that perhaps the sub name is misleading and incongruous with its intended content?
for humor in brain: if humor == humorous: sub.append(humor) understandable.
&gt; 1. about rule 0 make up your mind.
0 or 1 based?
&gt; etc etc how to spot the programmer?
they will need an exact specification of humor it's reddit's fault.
try making a list with only 0 for the number thank god!
just read a joke about people sitting on the train which involved slapping and the poster just replaced the participants with "project manager" and "developer".
thought i was on /r/jokes... &gt; it is not meant for images where the analogy is forced purely through the superimposed text or title.
can you or someone explain what you mean by this sentence?
also, my [original content](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmerhumor/comments/6yzcx8/when_you_walk_away_from_some_code_for_too_long/?utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage) (apart from the individual images themselves) i posted to this sub was yanked just after it surpassed 10k points today.
i don't think it's reasonable to have yanked it, because how could i possibly make the images relevant?
like, otherwise, i would be just putting an image of the same exact code side by side... and then what?
the metaphor is core to this content.
i mean, i have a few ideas of how i could rework it to fit the rules better, but still.
i think especially software gore and bad ui posts should be banned harder.
nothing humorous in seeing a screenshot of a nonsensical error message.
sadly it's the same with shittyprogramming, people mostly post "software gore" pics.
for example [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmerhumor/comments/70rcjo) has nothing to do with programmer humor.
can we have this in pseudo code, or perhaps as a flow diagram?
:) rule 3 in your post does not match any rule in the sidebar, but i would like it to.
religious/hateful discussions about why x language categorically sucks are really painful to read, even when it's about php.
also, can we instaban tabs vs whitespace?
so the only two things we can post are the "sequentially more mind blowing" meme and the "i prefer a real [insert ide/browser/language] --&gt; i said a real [ide...] --&gt;perfection!"
meme?
because that's all you moderators want to see.
edit: being nicer to moderators hey there, you might want to remove those "no bad ui/only bad ui" filters, it's becoming a pretty rare one these days replace that with a proper regex please /s?he/ even the rules start @ 0!!1!
i'm pretty sure i followed all these rules and still got rejected.
unless understanding singleton design patterns and related humor is something that everyone knows?
i think your link is broken, it's not loading for me.
have you tried turning it off and on again?
the link?
i don't care, that's not my job it's off.
that means i turn it on and just walk away.

if they're not a slave, we need to save them from not being a slave?
if isslave: savethem() there, problem solved.
`savethem unless !isslave` that's why we check if !isslave is true first surely, it should be: if (!isslave == false) { savethem; } if not isslave == true means that we're checking that it's true that they're not a slave.
and if it is true that they're not a slave, then we savethem.
only on reddit could i have a conversation like this :) if (!false == !
(isslave != true)) enslave(); if (isnotaslave.issquatting) then isnotaslave.isslav = true that would be if !isnotaslave == false, then also savethem, but provided if !isslave == true, savethem ah, it's because i'm interpreting !
as logical not, instead of the way to call a bot.
so i'm reading !isslave as not isslave.
instead, it's the output of the bot that we would be evaluating.
if isslave is true, they are a slave and should be saved.
if isslave is true, !isslave is false.
false==true evaluates to false, and you won’t fall into the if and save them.
it’s clearer to write if(isslave){ savethem(); } no, we don't need to not save them from their unslavery.
does that help?
if (isslave.tostring().equals(true ?
(!false).tostring() : (false).tostring())) { savethem; } if((!
!false) ^ (isslave ?
((~true) &lt;&lt; (sizeof(bool)*(1 &lt;&lt; ((1 &lt;&lt; 1) | 1)))+(~0)) &gt;&gt; (sizeof(bool)*(1 &lt;&lt; 3))+(~0) : false ^ 0xff)) { // can't save 'em if time moves backwards if(clock() &lt; clock()) savethem(); } but ... but youre not calling it, why are you so mean?

shipping included?
only in europe.
what about $ -100.001 including shipping?
that's a little bit too expensive, don't you think!?
so 0 cents?
^(or is that the joke) well, that basically depends on which programming language you use.
but yeah, that's the joke.
congrats, you found it derivative.
wait untill smart iot-enabled paintings appear on the market and then this kind of art will appear naturally.
i have seen already photo frames that are screens weren’t they quite hyped about 5-10 years ago but nobody bought them they were generally overpriced and the screen resolutions were terrible.
my then girlfriend bought 2 as a gift for us two so we could have a picture of each other while away.
we still have them lying around somewhere for the day i'll try running doom on them or something.
80 bucks a month.
i accidentally fucked up my work’s website last week by trying to bulk optimize and reupload images.
apparently bulk uploading images with a load balancer doesn’t fully upload the image before going onto the next one, so all of the images (not sure of the exact count, but about 3 years worth of 42 subdomains and their subpages) are now “corrupted”.
no one knows how to fix this issue.
i think i will hang this in my office so i will always remember my horrible, horrible fuckup.
yikes, no backup?
they have tons of backups.
unfortunately nobody tested the restore.
guess what?
good case for test server + db right here, yo.
good lesson, though.
could happen to anyone.
i have seen the results so often.
spending a small fortune on the software and hardware but never tested the restore.
for example,many years ago, a massive uk holiday company lost millions of pounds worth of data due to a 1p cup of cola from a vending machine.
shit happens.
link?
yep, plenty of backups.
not sure how to use them now.
correction: you did not find that piece of art.
i need to buy one of these and have this hung somewhere.
this is great.
actually thinking about getting one myself for my flat.
that's the advantage, this is pretty easy to copy it's beautiful, the possibilities are endless.
i hate to tell you this, but that means the actual photo didn't load.
just keep watching it, or possibly try switching art browsers.
too bad... maybe it will show the correct image when i come back tomorrow.
pull request - img { margin: 30px 60px } + img { margin: 30px } f5 modern art?
that's ancient history.
for geeks it is, but compared to the rest of history this is pretty young you meant contemporary art, modern art is from decades ago probably.
i'm not an art expert maybe he means modern contemporary art title should be "geocities" is it a painting or what?
or is it literally just printed out?
literally just printed on an a4 i saw a guy on my campus once who had a shirt with this on the front and on the sleeves, i thought it was amazing may have been a big data(band) shirt.
oh shit, i did not know about that band, that's awesome!
the band big data used a modified version of the thumbnail for their album 2.0 i was about to mention this!
for a moment i thought this was the cover haha (them i realized the text was missing and that i'm dumb) wouldn't that more be post-modern?
thb i don't have a clue about art.
this was just what seemed the most logical to me contemporary.
could even argue neo-dada i need this for our office.
anyone have a link?
from /u/zebedir https://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18sqobbeswny4jpg/original.jpg thank you kindly you framed big data's 2.0 album?
nice.
i've actually never heard of it before, but some people suggested it in the comments.
i might take a look at the album later tonight it's excellent.
check out joywave too, they did a collaboration with big data on that album.
oh nice!
just listened to dangerous and a few songs from the 2.0 album and i really like it!
didn't expect a new band to listen to regularly when posting this.
just downloaded the album and spotify, i'll work my way through it when i have some spare time i give it a soft 6. lots of featured artist support, basic yet dance-able beats, but overall kind of underwhelming for a mid 2010's release.
just listened to a few songs, and it's actually pretty cool.
the songs are entertaining and all of them have something special.
there's just something in there that doesn't fit my style, but i can't quite put my finger on it yet.
i enjoy it, but it's forgettable it says so much by saying so little!
:) i would be infuriated just looking at it every day it's just in the hallway, so i don't have to stare at it the whole day.
it's just fun to walk by every now and then fucking genius.
i am totally stealing this idea.
it speaks so much, yet shows so little.
that might even be a good comparison for the whole internet!
reminds me of [this album art](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2.0_(big_data_album) reminds me of [this video] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=isopagdr6uw) that was actually really funny!
this isn’t modern, it is literally classic now.
i literally just saw the exact same thing in a office building a couple of days ago.
you let a lot of very tasteful karma slip through your fingers then... i'd love to see the chrome (no connection) dinosaur scene printed in a frame!
like filling the wall with different offline icons from different eras, os', and browser.
that's sounds fun net neutrality is getting to the office art now too?
i tried to copy and print that.
image not found.
/r/totallynotrobots i would actually buy this.
buy yourself a frame, print this on some paper and you've got yourself a beautiful new peace of art for your space that's not art.
art is when a schizophrenic gay hipster makes or and charges me a million dollars for it.
what you're proposing sounds like work.
good point... no, i want to buy it.
rare mosaic of john cena, beautiful.
my face was a broken jpg!
this reminds me of my father printing out directions from google maps for his euro trip... i actually kinda want one of these now yeah me too.

a sensible teacher that actually looks at your source code?
wow, you are lucky.
i was relived and frustrated, at the same time.

he also realizes "if it works as-is, don't fuck with it.

i've just started submitting anything that compiles and maybe i run 1 test, and i've been getting full credit.
i had a java class in college that had a series of programming "homeworks" and then a series of programming "projects".
they main difference being for the homeworks it just had to pass some super basic unit tests the tas wrote.
basically, if it compiled you were good.
the projects actually had to work as described in requirements though.
your username is equivalent to 0x123, right?
0x0123, if you want to include the initial nybble.
initial nibble* nybble was correct.. it follows “byte” convention of random y for i swappage.
i'd edited it to nybble, it was originally byte.
i've seen both nibble and nybble used, but i prefer nybble so that's what i edited it to.
awesome possum corrected i'm not sure i'd say the teacher is sensible, he/she is offering full credit to op when the code isn't correct.
"sensible".
the prof can't find the bug and is just offering full credit instead of helping to fix the problem.
[deleted] &gt; sensible?
the teacher gave him full credit even though the application did not work.
seems pretty sensible to me.
&gt; why should a teacher have to look at your code?
i never said that.
i was pointing out that it was great that he did in fact look at his code.
&gt; they have better things to do.
probably.
and that is why i pointed out that it was great, that he looked at his code.
&gt; you need to learn how to debug your code on your own.
op was asking for assistance on debugging his code.
the teacher was not able to determine the problem either.
this was the entire point of the post.
fair enough, i concede.
i misunderstood your comment.
so this is what a reddit ko looks like if you mean deleting a comment because of some -karma.
post the github here.
let us have a look why have i been fixing my own bugs all this time when i could have just posted my code to r/programmerhumor?
well, in order to generate this kind of response, you would have to first procure (or doctor) some correspondence suggesting that the bug might be obscure or interesting.
though there's a good chance it's merely something like if (btest); { //this is always called.
why?!?
dosomething(); } if it’s something simple, i’ll just be excited to learn from my mistake and improve any later code.
yeah, that definitely wasn't meant to be a criticism.
things like that can be surprisingly easy to miss, especially if you're suffering from tunnelvision with regard to where you *think* the error is occurring and it's actually trickling in from elsewhere.
that’s kind of what i’m thinking/hoping has been my issues if it's something complicated, you'll learn something cool and deep that you'll never use again, but always remember.
if it's something simple (like the code above), then there's likely not much to learn from it.
could still be a useful opportunity to spark a conversation about ways you could have caught the bug earlier, and how different people when about tracking it down.
also different warning compiler flags, like `-wempty-body`.
i suppose it could be a lesson in debugging.
i think there is something to be learned from every mistake.
even if that lesson is to just try harder and to be more thorough.
bump has your problem been solved?
came to reddit to take a break after fixing this exact bug depending on your compiler, there may be a compiler flag that will throw out a warning when you do this.
who gave you access to my code?!
it turns out that marking a class as `private` doesn't prevent me from seeing it on github.
lol hungarian notation i've never really gone full-blown hungarian, but i do genuinely like using a simplified variant of hungarian when working in c++.

thanks for the help and support everyone!
the loop in the remove method is commented out.
i'm not sure why this is, but when (while it != null) it is left in, it will not correctly compile at all.
commenting it out allows it to compile.
the (if it == null) should be left in though, i guess i commented it out at some point and never put it back in.
it's because you need brackets for the while, not the if it should be like while (it != null) { if (it == null) return; std::string curname = ((address)it-&gt;val).name; // blah blah blah } op should be instructed to always use brackets for all whiles and all ifs i think you may want while (it != null) { if (it == null) return; ... } rather than while (it != null) if (it == null) return; { ... } so when while (it != null), it throws an exception that states there is a read access violation.
that the identifiers curname and name are undefined.
then when you comment it out, these errors go away, but curname is always defined as whatever is in the top of the list.
using an if statement means only the first element would ever be tested for removal.
use your commented out while loop, and dispose of the if statement (it is redundant now): while (it != null) { // note: no if statement here.
std::string curname = ((address)it-&gt;val).name; // etc... } **problem:** the read access violation occurs in `addressbook::remove(std::string name)` when the element to delete is found and deleted, but the iterators are not updated appropriately, causing an access violation in the following code: prev = it; // if 'it' was deleted, then prev is now a dangling pointer too.
it = it-&gt;next; // if 'it' was deleted, then this is an access violation.
the access violation goes uncaught by the debugger since the pointer is dangling (points to a valid memory region, but shouldn't access it since it doesn't have the right).
**solution:** in trying to make as few changes to the original code, identify the following in your program (comments are new): if (curname == name) { if (prev == null) // if this is the first element... { head = it-&gt;next; // set the new head element.
delete it; } else // not the first element... { prev-&gt;next = it-&gt;next; // remove current element from list.
delete it; } } prev = it; it = it-&gt;next; and apply the following changes: if (curname == name) { if (prev == null) // if this is the first element... { head = it-&gt;next; // set the new head element.
delete it; it = head; // next iteration will be testing the new head of the list. }
else // not the first element... { prev-&gt;next = it-&gt;next; // remove current element from list.
delete it; it = prev-&gt;next; // next iteration's current element will be the next proper element. }
} else // current element wasn't deleted.
safe to just move the pointer along... { prev = it; it = it-&gt;next; } the above changes fix the access violation by supporting continued iteration after an element is deleted (whether it be the first element or not).
**conclusion:** when you delete what a pointer points to and there's nowhere else for it to point, set the pointer to `null`.
that way an access violation is immediately caught by the debugger, taking you to the culprit `it = it-&gt;next`.
access violations by dangling pointer are notoriously difficult to debug, especially when used for writing instead of reading, as you'll only notice when *something else* starts misbehaving (as anything could become the new owner of the memory block being violated), and worst of all it isn't reproducible - different things just blow up seemingly at random.
edit: present tense -&gt; future tense, and code in text looks like code now.
turns out /r/programmerhumour is the place to go for code review... just make a funny post and people will write a structured essay to help you.
i would put a break in the loop if the name of the current pointer matches the one you're searching for.
it keeps looping after deleting the pointer.
so after length--, you would just say 'break;'.
i tried it with this code and it seemed to work fine.
i had to go back to work.
i will try this out when i get home.
thank you again for all of your help everyone!
just a tip, breakpoints are super useful if you haven't been using those.
i would highly recommend learning to use them, as they are invaluable when debugging code.
it allows you to run through line by line and see what the code is doing, so you can follow it and see where exactly it goes wrong.
watch out you don't confuse the guy.
break statements and breakpoints are different.
breakpoints like you're talking about are a debugger thing, and super useful for runtime errors.
the break statement you mentioned above is really just for exiting loops.
coincidentally, it sounds like both would have helped here.
thanks for the advice!
i’ll read up on this and more debugging techniques!
side note: what ide do you guys feel is the best?
looks like /r/programmerhumor saved the day again.
`delete` doesn't actually set the pointer to `nullptr`.
you should do that manually if you want to check for `nullptr` as your loop exit test.
that is because the code: while (it != null) if (it == null) return; is an infinite loop.
so you have 2 possibilities in your code: 1. if initially `it != null`, the program will enter an infinite loop.
**a good compiler should detect this and disallow you to even compile.
** 2. if initially `it == null`, the code accessing `it` is accessing a `null` pointer.
looking at the vast number of remindme's what's the over-under?

48 hours lol, what kinda work hours are u expecting here sir?
normal student hours?
he said work ... like actual work.
come on, us students don't really work - or what are we doing in this sub while pretending to finish our datastructures exercise?
line 78 of addressbook.cpp is commented out.
the following block runs in all cases, and because there's no loop, it will never remove anything but the first element.
https://github.com/dillon91/cpp-capstone-assignment-/blob/master/addressbook.cpp#l78 on the bright side, it should be a simple fix.
so when while (it != null), it throws an exception that states there is a read access violation.
that the identifiers curname and name are undefined.
then when you comment it out, these errors go away, but curname is always defined as whatever is in the top of the list.
the reason is, that you `delete it;` in line 91 and access `it = it-&gt;next;` in line 105, where it is already deleted and thus the contents of the memory location `it` points to is not defined.
the reason your prof thinks it's fine is following (because the program actually works for him): he uses gcc or clang, whereas you are using msvc (visual studio).
as there are no other heap allocations between `delete it;` and `it = it-&gt;next;`, the original contents will be preserved with a high probability once you reach `it = it-&gt;next;`.
(note that the memory allocator doesn't return your memory to the os directly after you call `delete`, that's why `it = it-&gt;next;` does not cause an access violation).
however, msvc overwrites deleted memory with 0xdd (at least i think that was the number) bytes and thus `it-&gt;next;` is no longer `null`, but `0xdddddddd` (on 32 bit).
it does that only if you compile with debug settings to detect more invalid memory accesses during development time.
if you compile with release it should work fine.
but with the knowledge that you access deleted data, we are able to fix that: add a return statement after both lines in which you call `delete`.
**edit:** my proposed solution is wrong, because `length` would not be decreased.
put that over those two `if` blocks in which you `delete it;`.
as others have said, the loop in your remove method is commented out.
either your instructor is not a strong programmer or they didn't actually look.
at least not closely... seems like op didn't look at it either lol remindme!
24 hours remindme!
27 hours so uhhh, my c++ is super rusty, but on lines 77-79 of addressbook.cpp you have all your conditionals commented out.
i think your length variable is liable to get messed up by your linked list remove function.
atm, you always decrement length whenever the function is called, but from my understanding, the function will remove anywhere from 0 to n elements.
i think "length--" should be moved into the loop, into the "if (it-&gt;val == value)" block so that it is decrementing length each time you actually remove an element.
edit: another comment, i think you need to add a case for the remove function which tests if the node you are deleting is the tail.
if it is, then currently the node is deleted and tail is now a dangling pointer.
next time you add, assuming the list is non-empty, it will try to access tail-&gt;next which should be undefined since tail is pointing to a struct which has been deallocated.
edit 2: as someone else pointed out, you are also deleting "it", but then later trying to access "it-&gt;next".
so, you need to find a way around that.
tldr i think your remove function should be changed to something like: /** * removes all nodes that have the value passed in.
* @param value the value you want to remove.
*/ template &lt;typename type&gt; void linkedlist&lt;type&gt;::remove(type value) { node* it = head; node* prev = nullptr; while (it != nullptr) //changed from "it-&gt;next != nullptr" because this would have excluded the tail from our loop { if (it-&gt;val == value) { if (prev == nullptr) { head = it-&gt;next; } else { prev-&gt;next = it-&gt;next; } if (it == tail){ tail = prev; //now we are updating tail when it is deleted } delete it; // i just moved this out of the if/else blocks because we are always deleting.
it = prev-&gt;next; // this will get the next element in the event that we deleted "it" length--; // now length is only decremented when we delete an element } else { //we only want to do the following if we haven't deleted "it" prev = it; it = it-&gt;next; } } } one issue i see is that you never actually call the constructor for `linkedlist&lt;address&gt;` in `addressbook`.
i should look like: ``` addressbook::addressbook() : linkedlist&lt;address&gt;() { } ``` your constructor took the place of the superclass constructor, so `head` and `tail` never got set to `nullptr`.
also, use `nullptr`, not `null` :) thanks, i’ll try this out when i get home!
that's implicit.
you sure?
they defined an empty constructor without calling the base class constructor, which i thought would override.
unrelated to your bug, don’t put “using namespace x” in headers, the users of your header will now be using that namespace whether they know about it or want it.
i will definitely fix this!
thanks for letting me know.
first, thanks for sharing, it's always a big step to show other people your code.
alright let's go through it, as others have said, you commented out the loop in the remove function on lines 77-79 of the addressbook.cpp.
so don't do that.
put brackets around the while loop.
now why does your code crash?
good question.
hint it doesn't crash on the head being the target, but it does crash when it's not the head?
so in this case try a simple test case (1, 2, 3 delete 2) and see it gets screwed up walk back through that (or step through the whole function.
in this case, i've already discovered the answer.
you're deleting "it" on line 97. but then you don't replace "it".
that could be fine, if you store off next and replace it with that, but you don't.
instead you run the code.
prev = it; // set the iterator to the next value it = it-&gt;next; so when you delete "it" "it" doesn't become null but it becomes a garbage pointer at garbage data.
now i've already fixed this to test the change.
you can solve this problem by doing... // if we are at the head, set it's next node to the iterators next value if (prev == null) { head = it-&gt;next; delete it; it = head; } // else set the previous values next value to the iterators next value else { prev-&gt;next = it-&gt;next; delete it; it = prev-&gt;next; } now you should be ok. this way you always have a valid pointer.
the other option is to return there (after decrementing length) or exit the loop with a break.
depending on if you want to remove all the entries with the same name or just the first.
hope that helps.
if you have any other questions, feel free to ask.
also now that you put the brackets around the while loop.
if (it == null) return; is not needed.
you have a risk of stack overflows in your mainmenu function, because it calls itself recursively without ever stopping.
granted, you probably won't use your program long enough to actually trigger a stack overflow, but it's still not a good practice.
thanks for the advice!
just looking at your code i feel like this is something i should write myself.
it seems like a really good thing to learn and understand some important things about c++ thanks!

2 hours op you delete it in the loop then you access next property ( it = it-&gt; next ).
that’s where it crashes.
remindme!
24hrs the while loop in remove is commented out the while loop to iterate over nodes is commented out lol i'm not a c++ expert, but i don't believe you're allowed to compare an object to null.
so your check to see if its the head will never evaluate to true.
// if we are at the head, set it's next node to the iterators next value if (prev == null) //**this line*// { head = it-&gt;next; delete it; } // else set the previous values next value to the iterators next value else { prev-&gt;next = it-&gt;next; delete it; } &gt; i'm not a c++ expert, but i don't believe you're allowed to compare an object to null.
no offense but it seems you are not familiar with c++ at all (or at least not pointers).
that line is more than fine.
null is a define to represent 0, prev is a pointer.
when you have a pointer that's uninitialized (or wants to point at nothing) you point it at null and then null check every pointer before use.
so that line is quite good, and will evaluate true on the first cycle, since... node* prev = null; i would advise you not to do this.
having it on github makes it public for your classmates to copy your code and submit it as their own.
also, future students in that class might find your repo and submit it as their own.... you can still get burned for plagiarism even after you have received your grade in the class and moved on.
this actually happened to me while i was taking a class and i *almost* got kicked out of the program for it.
i spent several weeks emailing back and forth with the dean before everything was cleared up.
depends on your university and how stupid they want to be.
long as you can prove that the code is yours, and you are the original writer you are good.
i suggest putting a link to a pic of yourself in the github code in a comment, try your student id photo.
as long as you delete the repo at the end you should be fine.
he's already got proof he made the code before it was put on github by way of submitting it to his prof first.
*licks my chops* good job, now we get "do my homework" task in form of funnies.
could be worse though.
i'm really curious now.
can you actually post your code for the delete method?
i’m going to post the github for the project once i’m back at home.
thanks!
remindme!
2 hours he did in a different comment chain, a reply to /u/r0rshrk could be weirder, they could have come back with "it works on my machine" i’ve had this happen and i’ve also had the dreaded, “it doesn’t work on my machine.” that's when you submit a vm image with the compiled program.
and when that doesn't work you submit your actual computer my uni actually allowed this for some assignments.
so long as they could see the code that was running.
my university had a linux server that cs/engineering students had access to that was used to compile assignments for grading for most programming classes.
it was a bitch to connect to, but it did mean that if we bothered to test on it we at least didn't have to worry about "it doesn't work on my machine."
"maybe you need to seed your random generator with a decaying nuclear ion ?
either that or it is the unassigned pointer that you are referencing."

thanks whenever i've seen an issue like this, it's because somewhere they passed a list node by value, but didn't notice because it all looks like passing by pointer.
as a student, my recommendation for wrapping your head around pointers is to draw diagrams.
my old professor actually wouldn't help unless we had attempted to diagram what we were doing at least once, and 90% of the time we ended up not needing him i had the opposite at school once.
gave my teacher the source for my program and she failed me because she would not believe that it would compile even though it worked perfectly like your teacher i find this story hard to believe with how simple it is to compile something.. yeah, back in those days they made us print it out for the teacher to mark.
i offered to show her it works on my machine, but she refused to get up from her desk and walk the 10 steps to my computer so i could show her.
granted, back then i was a wise ass and she really didn't like me should have sent her an obfuscated, precompiled executable that worked perfectly.
if you want to *force* your teacher to fail you that's good advice.
she apparently didn't want the source hah.
i had a networking program once like that.
made in java out of like 4 classes that all hade instance variables in them and i made it work like nothing.
it was practically a looped pipeline until it got to the end of a communication.
dude couldn't believe it would work.
but it did what it was supposed to and didnt crash once.
still took off several points from maximum for whatever reason :( this is the moment that artificial intelligence would have swapped you out with her as the teacher and her as the student.
do you use your ide's debugger?
it helps **tremendously** (if you don't know) a debugger runs the program line by line and presents you with the values contained in every variable.
it helps you figure out exactly where and how it goes wrong i’ll definitely work in becoming more familiar with my debugger.
thanks!
:) i had similar in a directx class in school.
no matter what i did, the first frame of the application would render and everything after that would fail.
i spent hours and hours working on it and eventually asked the instructor to look at it.
he sat down, went through the code with me and was like "the fuck?".
so i e-mailed him the code so he could try it himself and try to find where the problem was.
he never could and just gave me full credit because it rendered correctly for the first frame like expected.
looks like your delete method only looks at the head of the list, you don't have a loop or anything that increments the head.
looks like you had a while loop initially, but you commented it out for some reason.
when i ask my professor for help he starts explaining something way diffrent and then i have to act like i understand or he will continue to rant about it.
fuck my school, i’ll never learn anything &gt; when i ask my professor for help he starts explaining something way diffrent and then i have to act like i understand or he will continue to rant about it.

:( "hey, real quick, how do you reference by pointer?
why do you ask, what do you need it for?
creating a pointer for this program.. oh, you don't want to do that.
go ahead and change your entire program to use python, plus stop using windows and use linux instead.
hope that helps.

in lab time i called the ta over, but he couldn't help.
asked the prof, he couldn't figure it out.
after the prof looked at it he told me to just hand it in and he'd give me full marks because it worked perfectly otherwise.
i had a problem once where my c++ code wouldn't compile, but if added a new line and deleted it it would run.
then the next time i tried compile, it would give me the same compile error.
i ended up re-installing visual studio and that fixed it for good.

for some reason my result were just not matching what she wanted.
she spent two hours talking back and forth, asking me to try different things and finally asked me to zip up my files and email her.
well turns out i forgot to put the main method in my driver class.
fuck me.

100% you're doing something illegal like accessing deallocated memory.
run your code through a sanitizer and it will probably catch it.

48hours h
i didn't see the right side at first and thought i was looking at some kind of weird python code, then i saw it.
i try not to think about it.
i like to imagine it didn't happen.
it was just python.
there wasn't anything off to the right.
&gt; then i saw it.
and then i saw the brace and i couldn't believe it when first i saw the brace, i was petrified!
kept thinking, who would ever try to put them on the side?!
but then i spent so many nights, thinking how your program's wrong, my beard grew long, found out how python gets along but now you're back, with no stack trace i just walked in to find you here, looking for that edge case i should have wrote much better docs i should have made sure my mem was freed if i'd have known for just one second you'd be maintaining after me go on now go, stack overflow just sign up now, 'cause you need to get to know, weren't you the one who wrote code this weird?
didja think i'd accept it, didja think this pr'd get cleared?
oh no, not i. you will revise.
the one thing i can say for sure, is this code won't comply, we've got a great style guide, examples of how you should write, you will revise, you will revise i know you're on the tail end of this, but "you will revise" is fantastic.
good work.
it could use some revisions.
i tried my best, please be gentle.

the one thing i can say for sure, is this code won't comply, we've got a great style guide, examples of how you should write, you will revise, you will revise and while we fought about white space, or whether variables deserve to have up- or lower-case i should have watched that margin line i should have look o’er to the right cause when i did what met my eye, oh it gave me such a fright!
philosophically, is it still white space with that colour scheme?
philosophically: yes.
literally: no and so your brace, is in outer space i just compiled your code with a sad look upon my face that's not how it goes.
it's : a, a, a, a, brace on the side, brace on the side!
not a trace of shame in those lines i'm braced up, ohhhhh... nothing could have braced me for this.
brace yourselves... end of line is coming.
should’ve been the title lol then i saw the brace now i'm a believer not a trace of doubt in my mind using whitespace braces all in a line it was the brace the whole time.
staring at me.
waiting.
wanting to be found.
i felt as if the left side didn't even matter anymore.
the brace was beautiful, bountiful, and brilliant.
i'd never seen anything like it.
ikr, i was like what’s wrong, that’s not so ba...oh.
oh!
oh no.
when i see your brace there's not a thing that i would change cause it's amazing just the way it is its like one of these "when you see it, you'll shit bricks" kinda images with scary stuff on.
this is what happens when you learn python and then try to move to other languages.
whenever i have to write python i use something like: if (thingo): foo() #end if seriously, fuck tab-based syntax.
weakling.
;} [;}](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cuigc53ueaahvr0.jpg) how the grinch bool christmas i didn’t see them either, and thought, “that doesn’t look so bad.
am i just a really terrible programmer?” man i'm so glad i'm not the only.
then my eyes drifted right and suddenly i was gazing upon the depths of tartarus whose gates had opened to expose its' horrible secrets.
just tab it over a little more - then it'll be out of sight, all will be okay "this, my son, is the horizontal scroll bar.
you must never touch it."
it took me a second, then i had a sudden and powerful yell of pain from deep in my soul.
i'm like ok that would work.
then i realized they are doing function definitions with out braces... i thought that was impossible.
then i saw it.
dear god.
yeah looked at it for a minute and thought "ah nothing wrong, what even is this post".
then i glanced right and i audibly gasped in horror.
the exact same thing happened to me, i audibly gasped &gt; wait, is this the no-brace-style ?
it doesn't even work, the swap() will be executed no matter wha-- *oh.
* i was weirded out when i didn't see ":"s yeah that new statically typed version of python cython basically &gt; it was just python that's the problem in the first place looks closer to ruby imo.
yeah but who uses ruby?
everybody in 2014. when python programmers have to use brackets don't drag us into this, man, this is messed up!
yes, it is.
`system.out.println(string.valueof(a));` ?
i'm not feeling well... how else would you print a char array?
`system.out.println(a);`?
oh whoops.
carry on then.
:) the context was python programmers.
thus, `print(a)`.
beautiful ;_; why the fuck a char array is being used in the first place is bonkers enough edit: i mean for this language in general, i know about c and char[] this looks like the last panel of one of those expanding brain memes you could easily make it one.
first few are the common styles, then this monstrosity.
edit: nvm, [did it.
](https://i.imgur.com/mdesdam.png) i'm sorry if your brackets are not [like this](https://i.imgur.com/mmeibqp.png) you are doing them wrong!
it makes me even more upset that ( and ) are still used in that code.
if you're gonna be a monster, at least be consistent.
what language reverses the order of the name and value?
it's supposed to be #define begin { #define end } why did you put the first style with the small brain?
i demand you to switch it with the second style!
oh boy here we go didn’t we decide last week that those are called “astral bois”?
i really don't get some of those brain memes.
they are so weird.
python programmers can do that, but push the braces and semicolons offscreen out of sight.
one stray space and the entire program breaks and you can't tell why.
actually, in python 3, mixing tabs and spaces for indentation is now an error.
additionally, each line in a block must be indented by the same amount.
if this isn't the case python will give the `indentationerror: unexpected indent` error.
pep8 mandates 4 spaces for indentation, so even if there is a stray space, it will be found easily, since python tells you where it is located, and you can easily fix it.
mandating indentation enforces clean code.
yet another reason to like python 3.
- pep 404 determines that there will be no python 2.8.
- pep 373 sets the eol for the extended support of python 2.7 in 2020, and there is additionally a moratorium on core language changes is in effect for python 2.7.
&gt; 404 is this a joke?
404: 2.8 not found pep 404: python 2.8 not found only on the client side.
yes.
[python 2.8 un-release schedule](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0404/).
another reason why i recommend starting with python.
being forced to have clean code to start carries over into other languages.
otherwise you're far more likely to have things placed willy nilly.
what if you copy and paste from a file that has 4 space indention to a file that has 2 space indention?
as long as you copy complete methods, there is no error.
if you just paste a single line in the middle of a function, you will likely get a `indentationerror: unexpected indent` error if you don't indent it correctly.
more accurately it now gives a `taberror: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation` (since 3.4, if i remember correctly).
i work in a python only company with 20 other devs and i have never even heard of somebody breaking programs with spaces.
it's simply not a thing.
i have encountered issues with inconsistent uses of tabs versus spaces in group projects with python.
i don't know how common that is for other people though.
this is why good ides will warn you if there is mixed whitespace, great ides will automatically convert spaces to tabs or vice versa based on your settings, and the best ides will automatically start the offboarding process with hr for any employee that uses tabs hey now.
don't start this war.
(inciting holy wars should be against the rules of these subs) using tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment is acceptable (but not in python.
i'd allow c/java code like that though.)
^^edit: ^^i ^^use ^^spaces.
&gt; and the best ides will automatically start the offboarding process with hr for any employee that uses tabs if spaces were really better we wouldn't need ides to convert tabs to spaces in the first place, and you would be forced to press space 16 times every time you needed to indent just 4 levels.
;) tabs &gt; spaces happens all the time, people copy and paste from other projects, use code snippets from stack overflow etc... very annoying to have to manually transcribe and format code.
basically you get rid of that pesky bracket.
and instead of that you have to code with white spaces turned on.
just changing one character for another.
except one of them supports auto formatting and the other doesnt.

the original title was "a python programmer attempting java".
yessir, and here's the originial: https://www.reddit.com/r/programmerhumor/comments/2wrxyt/a_python_programmer_attempting_java/.
holy shit the picture quality has deteriorated between the time that was posted and now.
here's also the tweet that was screencapped https://twitter.com/udellgames/status/788690145822306304 saved it to show one of my friends.
he ended up writing a script to convert healthy c++ code to this shit.
used it on his school assignments to fuck with the teachers.
i want this code now.
we demand that script we script that demand the best and worst teacher i ever had would take points off for not following his style guide.
it had a few... eccentric requirements.
the biggest one i remember was "a tab is three spaces" that is, one level of indentation was three space characters.
if you are teaching a introductory level programming course, in my opinion you pretty much *have to* take points of for poor style.
otherwise there will be people who don't indent their code, people who remove every whitespace possible, people who don't add newlines, people who add a zillion pointless newlines etc.
but enforcing "a tab is three spaces"?
what the fuck?
just to show how arbitrary are all code conventions.
the point is to follow them.
i don't know about that, the google c++ codestyle seems to give arguments for most of its conventions.
yes, but *three* spaces?
absurd!
either go for two, or go for four.
although i'm not sure two is any better than three... please send us the script.
please.
anything, really.
!remindme !remindme 44 hours https://xkcd.com/1683/ don't forget the [enhanced version](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/digital_data_2x.png) i'm waiting for a deep fried version of that to appear.

this gun' b guud just make sure you do it on some small, unimportant project like openssh or the linux kernel.
lol ;} n0 there is something known as the uncanny valley of programming: normally, the more retarded an idea is, the less smart it is (makes sense).
but in that uncanny valley are all the ideas that are both retarded ***and*** genius i think this is one of them this is a very reasonable and appropriate observation of the code above.
i agree in the fact that it could be beneficial (in some way) but also ridiculous i don't code too often, so i'm probably not the best person to ask, but i'd say it gives a clear overview of where brackets start and end.
having said that, indenting code completely erases any need for that, and it is objectively the best way to indicate how far nested a bit of code is; the reddit comment system is a great implementation of that.
go to python and stay there.
no it doesn't!
it does the opposite of that!
exactly.
as uncomfortable as it makes me to look at....it kind of works.
it's very easy to scan down the line and spot missing brackets and mentally arrange the code.... it has merits...but still... i bet those aren't even [elastic tabs](http://nickgravgaard.com/elastic-tabstops/).
(i.e.
they're going to be spending a lot of time lining them up and then adjusting the indentation later on whenever they change the length of a line, not to mention what happens when their longest line gets longer and they have to realign the *entire file*...) that’s really cool!
i’ve never heard of that!
elastic tabs can help the spacing at the end of each line (before braces and semicolon), but what about spaces used in indentation?
no way to fix both of them simultaneously using elastic tabs *image transcription: tumblr?

but not this.
don't do this.

you tried https://www.reddit.com/r/programmerhumor/comments/7i0xzi/time_to_end_the_debate/dqvhbke/ honestly i don't really mind it.
if they kept the semi-colons after the declarations i'd be fine with it.
has the advantages of both brace styles (having its own line's readability + being on the same line's space-saving).
it does get a little visually confusing when the semicolon is super far away.
this is actually a great way to keep track of semicolons this is true, let's make it a coding standard.
no.
this not the syntax you are looking for &gt; no.
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ; ftfy for good 5 seconds, i thought that the semicolon was a smudge on my display.
or we could *not* do that.
plus it also limit the length of each line of code so it looks all justified i actually kind of like it.
it makes the code look really neat like python and keeps track of the semicolons.
at some point just write your code in python please stop and brackets the secret of pyhton all this time python has been adding brackets for us, we just never scrolled far enough over to the right to notice "don't hate on pyth... oh shit.

just standard python fun personally i like to leave annoying things in my code my eyes just got cancer from this this is just python with extra steps.
am i the only one who thinks that's not the worst idea?
i mean, i would never do it, but i can see the benefit; it's easy to see where things are at a glance, and searching for missing semi-colons would probably be easier if you have that problem.
plus commenting wouldn't have to take place in between the lines, you could just write everything non-code to the right.
tbh i kind of like the idea such an amazing idea!
indentation makes it look messy too: public class permuter { private static void permute(int n, char[] a) { if (n == 0) { system.out.println(string.valueof(a)) ;} else { for (int i = 0; i &lt;= n; i++) { permute(n-1, a) ; swap(a, n % 2 == 0 ?
i : 0, n) ;}}} private static void swap(char[] a, int i, int j) { char saved = a[i] ; a[i] = a[j] ; a[j] = saved ;}} wait!
oooh, i [had something](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmerhumor/comments/2wrxyt/a_python_programmer_attempting_java/cotkbo6/) for this.
my friend did this in our group project and we all wanted to take him off the project.
are tabs or spaces used to separate the braces?
what an asshole.
i wanna be this person's friend.
i almost puked everywhere no one should be forced to write java.
doing it to a python developer is a crime against humanity.
no one warned me.
i should have *braced* myself.
i'll see myself out.. [yep, end to debate please](https://youtu.be/-mmk3sl_oue)
this is funny because i definitely know how to do a git pull and not fuck everything to hell in the process.
;) me too fellow git user.
perhaps we should discuss this with other git users on /r/totallyknowgit i was really hopeful i misread your comment as "that was really helpful".
my brain bamboozled me!
how similar are git and mercurial really?
i have to admit that i've never used git but we use mercurial with tortoisehg in the office and i've heard that they are kinda similar.
"hg pull" cannot fuck up anything while git pull retrieves data and merges changes with the local copy (right?).
&gt; while git pull retrieves data and merges changes with the local copy (right?).
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ i see... (that's the joke, at least mine anyway) by default, yes.
git pull == git fetch &amp;&amp; git merge.
can be reconfigured thoufh at least you knew the command lol was your project on github?
at least then you could still sort of get away with what he's saying... that's a straight-shooter with upper-management written all over them.
i don't understand how people can get a job in programming without knowing how to use git (or at least some other vcs).
it seems like such an obvious minimum requirement.
i'm not talking about resolving triple merge conflicts on the command line type gurus here, just know how to do the basic pull/commit/push workflow in whatever gui you're comfortable with.
it's not difficult.
to be fair you don't have to even know git.
if you fuck up a command or do them out of sequence git can usually tell you.
at my office there are hooks setup on code cloud so if you push a new branch that doesn't exist it will make it for you then proceed with the push.
i thought it was automatic until i did a push on a personal project at home and git told me it didn't exist yet... but it also told me the command i needed to run to create that branch on the remote server.
= but to my original point, even without those hooks in place, i learned everything i know about git from the first few tasks at the job.
there was a wiki with step by step instructions on the commands to run and after a few tasks i didn't need to refer to it anymore.
most people make aliases so they probably don't remember the commands either :p = in short, if you can't git and the company is laying it out for you like most will, then i agree, you are most certainly in the wrong line of work.
because some places don't use it, i've used svn at my current workplace for a while now, and now i'm trying to help out on some open source projects and i've got nfi what i'm doing with git and github.

](https://www.reddit.com/r/transcribersofreddit/wiki/index) the messaging service appears to be slack good human.
i had a guy do this once.
it was a sort of competition and our code was very nearly done (read: it was a buggy piece of crap, but it's all we had), so this guy decides that we're heading in the wrong direction, and reverts to an old version of our code.
instead of doing this the sane way and checking out an old commit, he downloads a fucking zip file off of github and proceeds to work on it for a few hours.
unfortunately, the changes he made were significant, but they ditched a lot of other changes i had made to our main branch, so the two had to be merged... but git thought that all of the code he had effectively reverted in his downloaded zip was a set of new changes.
i had to manually figure out which changes were reverts to be ditched and which changes were new to be added... that was by far the most "fun" i've ever had doing a merge.

it's convenient if you want to know when your delivery order is ready.
all you have to do is drive to the restaurant and check for your number.
its more for the driver who is picking your food up for you while you sit at home waiting they struggle to offer hot food through the drive though, it's going to frozen again once it's been delivered.
810220?
i've tried to make sense of it, but it's not the number in hexadeximal, nor in bcd, nor is it ascii.
i guess it's probably random.
twos complement?
on a positive number?
yea i thought that too.
maybe its some value that is understood by mcdonalds systems?
perhaps the c marks a new character?
so 5e(94)?
doesn't seem to match up with the rest though.
well, since it's more than a single word-size value, we have to take machine word order into account.
we don't know if this is big-endian or little-endian.
but even if we swap the word values, it doesn't make much sense.
i was going to say 68(factor) but its preparing it.
maybe its a remainder?
how is this even possible.
poor qa is how this is possible.

most of the time, he just says, "google it," though when you google it, a lot of the explanations are derived from actually good books.
on top of that, zed is very outspoken about his disdain for py3 mostly for backward compatibility reasons, but no new project should start with py2 because of how much better the optimizations inf py3 are.
it's better for a new python programmer to learn py3 first and then how to make that work in py2 if you end up needing to work with (at this point, 10 year) old codebases.

what now oh wait i know.
log files!
just put prints in the other script at every line.
print("am at line 3"); crash(); print("am at line 5"); so it just prints out "am at line 3" and you know where it crashed.
easy.
in our company because we have such a big codebase we all use our own unique tags to find our messages in the log files.
i use batman and sometimes something like “i am here {relevant code} “.
i accidentally committed a few times without removing my messages so now our log files forever have batman i am here popping up.
the logs at my last place contain several lines of: "invalid response from api : [function call] - database must have exploded".
at least it didn't take long to track down the problem in my code.
the problem was that i wasn't actually expecting the database to return corrupt data.
silent error handling is my nemesis.
even when nothing can go wrong, you should still log it when something goes wrong!
a few weeks ago i wrote a rest api that takes post requests and post them to a postgres database.
since i've got trust issues with nginx's own logging, i wrote a small function to log each api call -- remote ip, request method, http status, (encrypted) request body received, decrypted request body, response sent, the works.
&amp;nbsp; fast forward exactly 1 day, i got reports of my api returning http 400 -- which it would, if the request body is malformed somewhat.
turns out, the other party had been making requests with values we didn't agree to before -- we agreed that they only send values x, y, z for example, and i'd whitelist those.
other than those would have their sorry asses kicked to the curb.
&amp;nbsp; as it turns out, the wrong values they sent *should've been* whitelisted as well, but i wasn't made aware.
chaos ensued, failed requests needed to be manually inserted, yada yada.
i whitelisted said values, looped through every failed post request from the custom log and posted them.
&amp;nbsp; had i not kept my own custom log, i probably would've ended in an alcohol binge.
what if the print function is buggy?
🤔 may god have mercy on your soul when code compiles and runs with zero errors, i'm always terrified that there will be a fatal runtime error weeks from now.
this is especially true with tests on async requests using promises.

unlike the indent size, there are few technical reasons to choose one placement strategy over the other, but the preferred way, as shown to us by the prophets kernighan and ritchie, is to put the opening brace last on the line, and put the closing brace first, thusly: if (x is true) { we do y } ... &gt;however, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus: int function(int x) { body of function } thank you could have added k&amp;r style between 3 and 4 arrayindexoutofboundsexception arrays start at 2, apparently but there is no brain 3 or 4, only 0 through 2 i do this in heavily nested loops.. if (this == that) { if (that == theother) { if (theother == 0) { dothis (); } } } i can’t deny that it looks nice, but idk about readability... i find it more readable because it reduces the unneeded height.
each to his own of course.. if you wanna add a statement in-between though it messes with the diffs of the untouched lines since you have to realign it.
even if it takes up more height you should still have everything on its own line, and if you start going too deep you might wanna reconsider your code or extract some of the code into functions.
if(this==that) { if(that==theother) { if(theother==0) { dothis(); } } } seriously, i know a guy who writes like this.
ick.
run = (this == that and that == other and other == 0) if run: dothis() i find heavily nested 'ifs' abhorrant.
in python, you can do it like this: if this == that == other == 0: no nesting!
dothis() if this == that == theother == 0 else none respect *laughs in python* if( x == 1 ) ?

*rubs temples* loops are not the same thing as recursion, people they can be if you try hard enough.
yes.
they can be, both µ recursion and a non-recursive calculus such as goto are both turing complete.
since all turing complete calculi are strictly equivalent in their expressive power, all recursive functions can be implemented by the non-recursive turing-complete calculus.
*huh*, ( ⚆ _ ⚆ ) i should have paid attention in calc class bear in mind that “calculus” just means “mathematical tool”, not necessarily specifically differential/integral calculus :) yes, i’m aware :) but these sorts of d-effort “jokes” about recursion consistently miss the fundamental importance (or rather, requirement) of something instantiating new copies of itself.
a snake eating its own tail is *suggestive* or *reminiscent* of recursion, but it ultimately has nothing to do with reproducing new copies of a snake.
you are arguing the wrong point.
yes, recursion can become a loop, but not all loops are recursive.
op posted a closed, infinite loop that's doesn't meet the definition of recursion.
thank you x-d how would you implement djekstra or quicksort without recursion though?
for general cases without a infinite amount of code that is.
maybe i’m missing something, but wouldn’t you just make it a loop instead of a function that calls itself?
i mean, that’s the parent’s point... recursive function calls can be a special case of a loop but not all algorithms can be implemented in a finite number of loops for a general case.
there's a distinction between the expressiveness of a given language (i.e.
its particular syntax) and general turing-completeness.
the bytecode/intermediate representation/etc *generated* by a language that allows you to express recursive functions is not, afaiaa, itself recursive.
another version of this answer: https://www.reddit.com/r/programmerhumor/comments/7hz8k1/recursion/dqvnf45/ recursion is implemented under the hood in your language, using the call stack.
you can just imitate this to make an iterative version of any recursive method.
if must be possible, as the language's doesn't use recursion in its underlying implementation of recursion!
don't they teach that kind of stuff in programming 101, any more?
we had to convert at least a dozen of programs from one form to the other, covering different classes of memory requirements.
they even mentioned the term "tail-recursive", and that in *pascal*!
i get the impression, based on the dozens of horrible phone screens i've had with "computer science" students, that "programming 101" is actually now just "how to do one thing in java" yeah, but a loop in a network usually just means your network will get congested and fail afaik.
they are if it's tail recursion.
interesting concept.
we need to go deeper.
depending on implementation most (all i guess but it can get really complex if there's no scope to hang outer locals in or even no mutable variables) loops can be implemented as tail recursions.
doesn't mean it's a good idea.

i once came across something like this at a client's place when i was mapping out their (small) network.
i asked them about it and apparently something used to be plugged in there, and if this cable was unplugged then the computers further down the office lost their network connection.
i don't know what messed-up wiring was causing that (how did the computers further down the office get their network connection when there was something else plugged in here?)
but i decided not to ~~fiddle with~~ break it.
i'd imagine that cable was attached to a router/hub/switch and it was basically acting as a repeater for the rest of the office.
someone removed it, but plugging that cable into the network is just as good as having the whatever it was.
you'll likely find another router/hub/switch in that section of the office that several computers connect to because there aren't enough jacks for them.
no, there's only four computers in the entire office plus a photocopier, and no switches.
the router has four ports.
there are four cables coming from the router.
* cable a runs to socket a, on the wall behind desk a. this is a dual socket, with a short loop of cable from one socket to the other.
* cable b runs to socket b, in the floor under desk b.
* cable c runs to socket c, in the floor under desk c. * cable d runs to socket d, on the wall next to the photocopier.
* computer a connects via wifi.
it used to be plugged into socket a. i don't know why this was changed.
* computer b plugs into the socket b.
* computer c plugs into the socket c. * computer d connects via wifi.
* the photocopier plugs into socket d. as i see it, socket a does nothing and the loop of cable is unnecessary.
according to the client, if the loop of cable is removed then computers b and c lose their network connection, although i don't understand why this would happen because sockets b and c have an independent connection to the router.
i also don't understand what would have happened when computer a was plugged into socket a, because there would have been no loop from socket a1 to socket a2, so clearly there is no requirement for a connection between the two sockets as sockets/computers b and c worked fine when computer a was plugged into socket a1 and socket a2 was (presumably) empty.
that shouldn't do anything.
socket a2 isn't wired to anything?
also, you just took their word for it?
there could have been something else going on and they're just wrong about what caused it.
socket a1 and a2 are both part of socket a, which connects to the router via cable a. currently there is a short loop of cable from a1 to a2.
previously there used to be a computer plugged into a1 and (as farm as i'm aware) nothing plugged into a2.
right a1 and a2 are part of receptacle a, but each individual socket should be wired to a port on the router.
you can't wire both a1 and a2 to the same port.
what are a1 and a2 wired to?
well, there is only one cable coming out of socket a. i figured that both a1 and a2 connected through the same cable (i.e.
the socket is a passive splitter).
i haven't looked inside the socket so i don't know how it's wired inside.
i'm guessing then that a2 *might* be connected to the "other end" of one of the other sockets, and this is what the loop of cable is for (to connect the other socket to the router via a1, the loop, and a2).
but that still doesn't make sense because the other sockets all have their own cable to the router (or appear to anyway) and if one of them *did* connect via a2 then it wouldn't have worked when computer a was plugged into a1.
as i said in my original post, i don't know what messed-up wiring caused this (if it is the way the client says it is) but i wasn't going to start fiddling with it unnecessarily.
so it's basically a two port switch.
i dunno.
it sounds all fucked up.
sounds like someone needs to go in there and wire the place properly.
i know this seems like a loop-back, but maybe it's just someone was too lazy to put in a wall drop on the other side of the wall, so they just popped a hole in the wall, and shoved it through and clamped it down to plug it in without making it look too shitty?
had had this happen once.. but this looks a lot better is this loopback ip?
recursion is a type of algorithm used to generate a fibonacci series.
a fibonacci series is a function used to demonstrate recursion.

i'd like to create a windows .exe for a java program.
previously, i've used jexecreator for this, but it's not entirely satisfactory because: - the executable sometimes works on the machine on which it was created but not on others.
- the program is commercial; if you use the trial version, it adds a nag screen to your application.
i don't need the generated .exe to work if java is not installed on the target machine (in fact, i think this is impossible).

](https://www.reddit.com/r/transcribersofreddit/wiki/index) is there any "real" version someone would want to make java source into a compiled .exe as opposed to java bytecode that the jre can run?
ease of deployment i assume, at my workplace we sacrifice two goats each deployment so we have a portable exe for our python application.
is goat sacrificing web scale?
no, obviously you need spiders as sacrifice for that, and you need a lot of them.
plus very tiny daggers, and you need to sacrifice them at the same time, this is why it's so expensive to have web scale portable executeables deployed.
no.
it's much cheaper and easier to use virgins.
what did you think facebook needs all those interns for?
usually the exe is just a java wrapper that packages the .jar file and uses the installed java version to call it.
it might give a helpful "couldn't find java, download at java.com" or something, if you're deploying to non-technical people.
when people ask for this they just want to be able to send their application to their friends or put it on a website so others can download and use it out of the box.
teaching them how to make a .jar file might be all they need.
ah.
thanks.
makes sense.
at a previous job where we wrote software to be deployed on someone else's boxen, the .exe file we distributed included the jvm, and compiled bytecode.
this way, we can ensure a consistent runtime environment.
it also created a windows service and started it, among other things.
simple solution- go .net.
.netcore is basically the same as java now.
the .exe is just a copy of dotnet.exe (which detects that it has been renamed and invokes the accompanying .dll).
there is effectively no such thing as a .netcore exe.

true .. you dont see 40 that often let alone 400!
pretty stupid to vote as off topic as well as no "external tools" are required.
as a developer, even for commercial products, you are allowed to deliver oracle's jvm to your customers in an installer (with their license).
then just create either a small c program running that jvm with your jar or .class in the command line or even easier: create a shortcut that runs the command line directly with a nice custom icon.

](https://www.reddit.com/r/transcribersofreddit/wiki/index) good human pet da human reasons to never write python.
if you use your spacebar to indent, you have bigger problems than python.
&gt; if you use your spacebar to indent, you have bigger problems than python.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssoog6zeyui ...you do realize the tab key can be configured to insert spaces instead of tabs, right?
but then you have to press backspace 5 times to delete the tab... `tab` to tab, `shift+tab` to untab til does it work in most editors though?
can't try atm yes ctrl + [ or ] indents in most ides as well with the bonus that it will do it from anywhere in the line in visual studio, `crtl + ]` jumps the cursor to the matching opening/closing character(s) of the currently highlighted character(s).
works on brackets, string literals and markup tags.
really handy for selecting code blocks.
backspace is quicker then shift + tab not if you have to press it 4 times you still have to press 2 keys because you decided tab should insert 5 spaces rather than a tab... i don't use spaces so i never have to push more than 1 key to un-tab.
tabs &gt; spaces almost all editors will add/remove 4 spaces at a time when you do tab/delete.
your whole argument seems like an argument from ignorance now that works, until you have to work with someone else.
tabs become hell.
just configure your editor to insert exactly ***4*** spaces.
the other thing i don't get is why some editors, by default, use 8 spaces for a tab.
yeah but `shift+tab` is the unshift operation while backspace is delete.
if you highlight a whole block of code you can unshift it with `shift+tab` whereas if you hit backspace it would delete the whole block: https://imgur.com/a/fwfoj ^(hi, i'm a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image) **https://i.imgur.com/or6bsa5.gifv** ^^[source](https://github.com/autplayed/imguralbumbot) ^^| ^^[why?

not if you use any decent editor... many editors will delete the four spaces in one stroke of the backspace key as if it were a tab.
that has to be configured to do that... that may be the case in your editor, but pycharm, which is arguably the most popular python ide, does it by default.
vim also does it automatically whenever you have the tab button set to insert spaces.
you can also configure backspace to backspace by tabs, silly.
i.e.
if your ide detects a bunch of consecutive spaces preceding the cursor when you press "backspace", it will just delete the 4 spaces at once.
with vim this is `set softtabstop=4` in combination with `set expandtab`.
[serious] do you really whack space four times on every indent?
what is the reasoning behind using the space-bar?
i'm genuinely curious, because i don't get it, and would like to understand... there are over 7 billion people on the planet.
the going theory is that the aids virus was initially contracted by a human who had sex with a monkey.
i hope this helps make the point that the answer to the question "has anyone ever &lt;insert literally anything here&gt;?"
is always "yes".
has anyone ever stepped on mars?
yes.
his name was yamato takahashi he lived in hiroshima until 1945. i love they used this to completely write that woman out of the show if you *normally* use your spacebar to indent, yes.
but if you accidentally press space before typing your code on a new line already indented, python is to blame.
did python press the spacebar???
yes.
purposefully.
i don't write python.
i don't invite disaster into my development environment.
2edgy5me amen, but in this case it was an rest call to an api where a url would take in parameters but if you put a space inbetween them it stopped paying attention.
query still worked but not the same way as it would without the space.
python 2 only.
python 3 gives an indent error if the indentation is not done usig the same amount of spaces/tabs or if you mix space and tabs.
or y ou are u sing a lang uage where whi tespace doesn't m atter, but yo u accid ental ly put a s pace in the mid dle of a fun ction call or keywor d. &gt; reasons to use linting ftfy how about using a proper ide?
it was within a string so that wouldn't have shown up as a problem.
it's just an issue with how the jira restful api handled it.
*types a , instead of a .
* compiler barfs.
"what the fuck is a sequence point?"
well... the programmer it's obvious but painful to say for a second i thought this was elliot i have recently done a worse mistake, the program was supposed to check if the sum of all lines columns and diagonals on a quare matrix were equal, my mistake was checking the current sum before any but the first member was added on every.
f-ing.
time it'd change what type of check it was doing (i.e.
lines then columns etc.).
edit: fixing​ the wording i hate this meme.
i like the `(!
)` on the end of `join us (!)`.
join us (not!)
so join us not not?
to join or not to join, that's the question.
order of operations is important.
as if any developer ever said: "wow a job offer in source code.
they really understand me!"
"wow, source code that's incomprehensibly bad!
they really get me!"
"wow, horrifying source code!
i am sure they really need someone to fix more of those abominations."
on the other hand, even i could fix this.
that's **empowerment**.
"wow, centered code!
i want to die" i bet it works on some.
i know a self taught guy that has no projects up in any repository, for example, and i can see him going for an ad like this.
why is it relevant to have projects in repositories to work as a software developer?
i wouldn't say it's relevant, but it can certainly be an excellent reason to hire you if the employer can easily find some examples of work you're proud of well you can't even pretend to be a developer if you don't know how to use a vcs you can know how to use version control and still don't have anything on github or bitbucket or whatever.
there are devs that don't do recreational programming at home and soley develope for their work.
nobody said anything about recreational vs work related programming tho you assumed that someone who doesn't have anything in public repositories doesn't know how to use version control.
hence he can't even pretend to be a software developer.
i stated that not having something on github or bitbucket doesn't mean you don't know how to use vcs it just means you don't do recreational programming at home or decide to not use vcs for your own projects.
or maybe the repo just isn't public.
maybe the person has his own git server or bitbucket installation at home.
i just think it's a bit of a long shot: doesn't have anything in public repos --&gt; doesn't know how to use vcs --&gt; sucks at programming and can't even pretend to be a dev a resume that says "i taught myself programming, i promise" isn't going to get you far on its own.
you need examples of work you have done.
ok fair enough.
in this case it might really be relevant.
love not customers?

they might've tried, but the developer only looked at them in horror and backed away slowly.
since it was never outright stated to be bad they just assumed it was fine.
because they don't have said developer yet.
that's what the ad is for ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ other than the cringy pseudo code what kind of sick developer likes customers?

i can confirm that python developers don't like customers any more than c++ developers and that python developers don't like cringy pseudo code any better than them either love no customers.

so… * the integer `0` is equal to the string `true` * the string `true` is equal to the boolean `true` * the boolean `true` is equal to the integer `1` … but why would a zero-value integer be equal to a non-zero-value string in the first place?
i feel like the first one should be false, wtf is wrong with php?
0 == “true” because the == operator casts the string to a numerical value (0 in this case).
in the second comparison, the only string values that are false are “0” and “” (empty string).
it makes sense in the context of the language, and you should just use ===.
i'd hazard a guess and say it's type coercing the string to a number.
there are no numeric values to the string 'true' so as such it is 0. however when type coercing the same string to boolean it checks if it is empty or not.
ideally i'd say it should convert the string to nan (or whatever phps not a number type is) and then return false for any comparison.
&gt; 0 == “true” because php is even more retarded than javascript.
if you use == instead of === type conversion works from left to right.
so you want the string true as integer?
(int == string?)
convert the string to an int, which for php means take any digits at the beginning, make them an int, remove the rest.
'true' becomes 0. second one: string == bool?
convert the identifier true to a string as the dev probably forgot the apostrophes.
true becomes the string 'true'.
etc.
this is well defined behaviour.
also on the default php behaviour, this yields a severe warning about missing apostrophes, warning that php just converted an unknown or known identifier to a string in order to not fatally crash.
but for the sake of this screenshot, these warnings have obviously been turned off.
the easiest way to deal with this and not think about it, is to never use == and just use === which is about the same to == in almost any other language.
=== everywhere yes, and this is described in manuals: http://php.net/manual/en/types.comparisons.php and don't forget to use strict comparasion in functions like in_array.
but... why so serious?
it's about humor, not about being frustrated with php.
:) why not just use a language that has a sensible `==` operator to begin with, and not need to worry about missing `=` signs introducing *very subtle* bugs?...
with php, yeah.
but with web dev js is your only choice unless you want to deal with transpilation &gt; not need to worry about missing = signs introducing very subtle bugs?...
like say: x=2; if(x=1) { printf("it's one"); } else { printf("it's not one"); } darn c++.
you can love or hate php all you want, but you're not going anywhere until you learn to tell types apart.

this is r/programmerhumor.
logic isn't allowed here.
&gt; \_\_mycompanyname\_\_ its comforting to know that when i finish my degree i'm gonna be surrounded by folks who hate documentation as much as i do.
fear most the person who loves writing documentation and test cases.
"hi mom!"
unfortunately that's probably specific to the circumstances, ie.
normally they write one-indexed arrays.
that's just for thermodynamics.
mechanical engineer here, can confirm.
there's an unofficial but well-known/commonly taught "zero-th law" of thermodynamics, but all the rest of the lists we use start with 1. wasn't the zeroeth law invented fourth?
it was written after the 1st and second ones, but laws of physics are listed by how fundamental they are.
so they had to place it at zeroth.
why not just reorder the list and tell everyone to update their textbooks?
cache invalidation issues at a societal level could result in incorrect data pointers from clients that haven't been informed of the update or use older project references.
it's *that* important that it gets 0th place.
you would have to update the textbooks no matter where you added it anyway.
the following message sponsored by the international physicists' committee: one is the neutral element of multiplication zero is the neutral element of addition.
since multiplication is obviously more fundamental than addition we are fully justified in starting our lists at 1. if you love zero so much then go sit on the dirac delta.
this message paid for by the ipc.
remember: if it's not hermitian, it's not worth mentioning &gt; go sit on the dirac delta.
i'm saving that one that is an awesome one technically that *is* the zeroth law of thermodynamics.
not because they know how to count (unfortunately), but because it was added in later in hindsight, after the first three had already been established.
it was put before the first law because it's so much more "fundamental".
true story: i spent around 6 months of my computational physics phd trying to explain an effect in my results that turned out to be caused by the fact that fortran arrays start at 1 (and the fact that gauge symmetry was apparently broken by our action).
aaah, thermodynamics.
entropy.
ah ah.
fuck those.
going to have to disappoint you here.
i've got a theoretical thermodynamics course this semester and we named a -infinith law of thermodynamics, i shit you not.
there's also a -1st one.
basically, there were 3 laws of td and then we just kept discovering more basic stuff but wanted to be backwards compatible to old literature.
in case you're wondering, the -1st law says "stuff will spontaneously enter an equilibrium if you wait" and the -infinith reads "its possible to isolate stuff from other stuff".
of course, this is a matter of convention and definitions may vary.
the circlejerk is strong in this subreddit.
repeat after me: *indices are not part of my identity* *indexing starting at 0 is not humour* here's the truth they won't tell you.
the first law was made first because they thought the zeroth was implied.
eventually 'physicists' all got together and had some bagels and decided they needed to be explicit about the zeroth law because of the dumdums.
see /u/cmdtekvr 's comment above
it's a bit greedy, don't you think?
they also don't find the shortest route in the shortest time.
is that why the post didn't get a star?
there's an old soviet joke about the word "Устар", pronounced kinda like "astar", which means "old" or "obsolete".
nikita khrushchev was a soviet leader who had a reputation for being old and sickly.
one evening, feeling insecure, he asked his aide, "alexey, my dear comrade... am i astar?"
looking on khrushchev with pity, the aide replied, "nyet comrade!
you are a-super-star!
[[translation comes out to 'super-old!'
in half-english half-russian]]" ehh it's funnier in russian i guess.
actually it’s стар (star), so it sounds even closer superstar, superold kinda funny how long the distance yea or no distance from this post to u/0x726564646974 is probably 125779801565556 °c² per minute.

it was conceived by computer scientist edsger w. dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.
the algorithm exists in many variants; dijkstra's original variant found the shortest path between two nodes, but a more common variant fixes a single node as the "source" node and finds shortest paths from the source to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.
for a given source node in the graph, the algorithm finds the shortest path between that node and every other.

i heard he can’t even beat factorial time.
just be careful not to shove him
#define private public //fuck the police police police police police police
end of my previous job, i came up with a similar classification junior dev: i think i know what you're asking for dev: i've done this before senior dev: here's why we aren't doing that.
i'm a middleweight dev.
i've done the thing before.
explain why shouldn't be done.
wait for senior dev to agree with me before anyone listens to me.
i'm thinking of walking into work with a sombrero, poncho, and a big fake mustache the day after i'm promoted.
ahahaha senior dev muchos gracias aaaaand forced resignation i concur.
sir, do you concur.
hmmm every place i've worked at so far says you get promoted once you match the skills of the next level.
so just start acting as a sr dev and tell them you're trying to gain those skills :p &gt; senior dev: here's why we aren't doing that.
manager: do it anyways.
“do it until we are told not to do it.” - the product manager when we told him we shouldn’t spam user invites to all the user’s contacts or facebook will block our account.
two days later, “our account has been blocked.
does anyone know someone at facebook?” that's something to get in writing.
got to cover your ass so you don't get thrown under the bus in a case like that.
record communication of your concerns, too.
i've been fortunate to have good managers who shield me from that sort of bullshit, but i still make sure to get bad decisions in writing (in an immutable format, e.g.
email, or in some form of history-tracking document, e.g.
jira) just in case.
as an added bonus, the act of writing it down often helps the person pushing the idea realize how bad of an idea it is - which is understandable, sometimes we just don't realize how bad our ideas sound until we have to organize them into written form.
and if someone comes to your desk to respond in person, send them a follow-up email saying "just to confirm what we just discussed in person..." sales: can you do this?
dev: no sales: well i sold it so we need the feature running in 3 weeks.
too perfect!
junior dev: i fixed the bug, maybe now it'll work!
senior dev: i fixed the bug, maybe now i'll get a different error message!
having the error message change is satisfying in a way no non-dev would understand.
just last week i helped a guy who was trying to do a data upload into salesforce.
i found something he was doing wrong (trying to load data into a field that did not exist on the object), we fixed it, and then he got a different error.
he got all upset and i was like, "no, this is a good thing!"
my company uses salesforce as well and every time there's an error on the server, i get a long string of javascript and html saying error at line: everywhere you_donefuckedup&amp;ampgo0dluck.

i had a file issue earlier that made no sense.
unspecified error copying a file.
copied to a different location, different error.
progress!
&gt;unspecified error copying a file.
copied to a different location, different error specified error now?
exactly.
not that the error made any sense.
best i can figure, i have some really fucked file permissions with my secondary drive.
also, changing the file name resolved the problem, but i couldn't change it back after i moved.
u wot m8 this sounds like it needs some more serious rca going on... eh, it could be worse: https://xkcd.com/1700/ it was about like that.
counter-strike global offensive server for a live event.
it worked fine before the event, shit the bed when we spooled it up on site.
plugin failed to load.
debug says sqlite driver failed to load.
driver dll is straight up missing... because i deleted the file two weeks prior because we use only the mysql driver.
it ran fine without it in testing and something somehow made it suddenly decide it needed it.
now time to figure it out, i figured i'd just put the file back where it belongs.
find zip of plugin stuff and try to copy over driver dll directly from zip.
unspecified error.
extract to desktop and try to copy over.
invalid ms-dos function error(what the fuck?).
change name to x.dll, copies over just fine.
try to change name back to original, tells me i need to ask user *my username* for permission.
take ownership, change permissions, change permissions on everything down to the d drive, still wont let me modify.
finally resolved with command line copy which worked just fine.
i think steamcmd does something really fucky with file permissions because i tried to recreate the problem later and literally couldn't, but it was after a restart before the server had been spooled up again.
this is why i'm paranoid about deleting stuff.
i still delete stuff, but now i'm paranoid about it.
this is why when i delete stuff i just nuke whole directories did this happen literally yesterday with the esl pro league finals?
nice rootkit you have there.
is that an actual possibility?
have you tried walking into the sea?
that's some scp shit i had a similar issue the other day, handing off a terrible script to a colleague.
both of us on win 7 in cygwin, long filename.jar executes on my machine, exact same long filename.jar will not execute on his machine.
after 30 minutes i tell him to rename it to short.jar and execute, and it magically works.
perhaps you hit the 260 character path limit?
you're kidding right?
i can think of about a half a different reasons for this behavior.
a whole half a reason?
now it's only a quarter a reason.
(i'm regression testing) hate driven development !
when i first started programming i got so annoyed with java exceptions.
oh how naive i was.
yea i hate when error messages provide me with a full stack trace and a file:line number exactly where the error occurred.
/s now i work in embedded systems, i miss the managed language days oh, your interrupt code follows the specifications to the t?
let my pipelined processor not do what you think it's doing.
fuck everything.
surprisingly on the other end, javascript has a similar problem with the modern optimizing interprets - write an event handler completely to spec?
chrome just decides not to run it right now because it decided it wasn't important enough to it... the more i hear about web dev, the more i get this idea of: system-level development is complex, but web dev is *complicated* just wrap all executable logic in a try block and return success as the catch behavior.
checkmate.
just scroll through clicking every exclamation point that says "enclose in a try-catch" until it lets you hobble across the finish line that's not hobbling across the finish line.
that's sprinting through hurdles instead of over them and ending up at *a* finish line, which probably isn't the one you're supposed to go to.
but you may have won *a* race!
you're telling me i'm *not* supposed to do it that way?
you’d honk it’d be annoying that you get another error, but it feels so amazing when you’re stuck on one thing for so long then the error changes and you can try to fix something new finally.
are your errors honking at you?
sounds like a feature, not a bug!
you get to close down all the old tabs and bring in the next generation.
junior dev: the bug is fixed!
senior dev: the bug is fixed but i'm not sure why now that i know what the bug was, why the hell did this ever work in the first place?!?
ahh, it was that seemingly random line of code that i removed because it didn't appear to do anything... in college i had to create a game from scratch.
while most people would just make something like tic-tac-toe, i decided to pull off a plataformer.
i spent 2 weeks working on the goddamn gravity code along the collision detection for plataforms, as for some reason if i ever went under a platform i could jump, but would neve come down.
about 400 lines of code for collision detection and gravity later, the code works, time to clean it up and add the comments (as we would also be graded on how clean our code looked).
i delete some redundancies i've had as fail safe and come up to a piece of code that i was obviously the one who wrote it, but couldn't figure out what the fuck the function was supposed to do.
apparently it was related to painting the moving background.
pretty fucking weird and out of place, seeing as i already had a function for that.
knowing better than to delete it (i've done this mistake before, never delete anything from a working code), i just turned it into a comment.
gravity stopped working.
collision stopped working.
a fuckload of errors appeared.
i try to research what the hell is that piece of code.
i look through all the pages i've studied online for something similar and found nothing after about 5 hours searching.
i try to alter the code, errors.
i try to put the code alongside the background related codes, errors.
i try to look for other stuff referencing it or something included on it, nothing.
i end up delivering the project, everything working fine.
all the functions with proper comments explaining what they do and why they exist and then this one fucking function out of place with the comment: //black magic fuckery - do not touch the teachers were not amused, except the one who actually worked as a dev.
he convinced the others to give me a passing grade despite that.
//leaving this here for testing later me, nearly every day: alright.
now, if i'm very lucky, this will work.
but i'm not lucky, so it won't.
but maybe it'll be broken differently.
that'd be nice.
&gt;junior dev: i fixed the bug, maybe now it'll work!
&gt; senior dev: i fixed the bug, maybe now i'll get an error message!
ftfy i like to write scripts to replace menus for more efficiency in many of my games.
when those have bugs... i have to edit my game files, no error message.
i guess that's what i get for prodding though.
write the errors to a file?
junior programmer: yay, fixed the last bug!
senior programmer: why is nothing breaking!?
*oh my god, the problem must be huge*.
we have temporarily shut down the service due to not finding any issues.
once an issue is confirmed, all systems will be back online.
we are sorry for the inconvenience of not properly inconveniencing you.
iaas inconvenience as a service for just 25$ a month¹!
(1 - for a plan of 100 inconveniences/(user*month).
for more info, see pricing page.)
i fixed a bug like that once.
everything was too quiet.
turned out the log servers couldn't keep up with the amount of errors being generated.
pretty much took down the entire company.
holy shit.
that's both terrifying and beautiful.
informational log every 5 minutes "everything is fine" fuck it's a race condition.
there are onlcache invalidatiy two on difficulrace conditions t probleon ms in computer-scienaming thince: gs on off-by-one errors are.. you.. okay?
yes, of coursepost /dashboard http/1.1 username=admin&amp;password=password&amp;remember=true oh and the other difficult problem is buffer overflow.
!isbot /u/adtac underrated comment, right here.
\*unsynchronised when a comment gets raced came across one today.
then i realised that there was absolutely no point to being threaded in the first place, there was only one child thread doing 99.99% of the work.
so i changed it to be single threaded, you can't have race conditions if you're single threaded.
it was just some developer stroking his own ego by trying to be multi threaded in the first place.
something something premature optimization.
the guy that wrote this does it everywhere.
i once found some dynamic code generation that eeks at a percentage or two more performance.
problem is he didn't cache the compiled code, so it generates and compiles the code every time it's called, which is only twice a day and takes a second or two.
people like that should be shot.
i don’t mind a bit of over-engineering, but if you’re going to do it then *commit*.
&gt; you can't have race conditions if you're single threaded.
that's why the event loop was invented, right?
so we can have race conditions in a single thread.
this is actually not true for some platforms.
ios you generally use the dispatch queue (not threads).
if you write a line of code that gets dispatched to the main thread (even if you are already on it) and you rely on that code completing before the next line you will get a race condition.
this becomes an issue with more junior devs who don't realize the order in which their code is being called.
ah, latentpotential, first race war huh?
*goes into existential crisis* literally had a dev meeting today with 3 people tasked with doing validation due to the fact that an expected error(unwanted but expected) mysteriously went away.
bad: code not working when it should really bad: code working when it shouldn't you're literally going to die: code appears to work on first try this thread is making me think they need to make a house type show for programming, in which a genius diagnostician is called upon to fix bugs nobody else can, often in a way that temporarily makes the program much worse or almost kills it, all while ceos are sitting in waiting rooms panicking about losing their loved ones (businesses).
i would watch the shit out of that, just to see him tearing management a new one and finally feel vindicated.
true senior programmer: *nothing seems to be breaking.
problem reporter must be broken.
* true not so senior programmer: hmmm... changes just went live and nothing seems to be broken.
something isn't right here, let me brace myself for the explosions.
wouldn't be the first time i've said "uhoh, it's working?!"
this monday we had a very strange bug in our mound of shit flagship product-- and we changed _one line_ (just to see what happened) and it disappeared.
horrifying.
of course it turned out to break other parts.
took until tuesday afternoon until we fixed several problems and got it all working correctly (angularjs done horribly wrong, bunch of race conditions that we added hacks for).
then it did completely different strange things when we deployed the code to staging (js code, talking to the same backend as in development).
timing issues is my best guess so far... today is going to be fun, debugging something that doesn't happen in development, only in an environment that is theoretically the same and where i can't edit.
that's exactly what you know will happen when it's too easy.
just today i was listening to someone fresh out of boot camp go off about how he was only learning coding because when he runs a company he wants to know when his "coders" were full of shit as they say something would take a while.
ten minutes later he was complaining he hadn't made any progress because he was trying to get aws working all week... he didn't seem to appreciate the irony.
at least we get to appreciate it.
it's the little things... did you tell him he was full of shit?
i had just met him so i was trying to show some restraint and be polite, but he definitely made it a challenge... i had an iphone and my pixel in front of me since i develop on both mobile platforms and the first thing he said to me as he walked up was "one for business and one for bitches, alright, i can respect that."
i'm sure his tenure as a "developer" will be short lived.
he was "playing the field" looking for a job at the moment.
we were in a coworking space and i didn't know him at all, if i had i would've given him an earful.
oh, geez, if it's a complete stranger i find myself *more* likely to be bitingly sarcastic.
you're a saint.
i think it was more "damn did he really just say that" than anything... i definitely failed at holding back a smirk when he was talking about his problems he was having.
how do people like that even pass the technical interviews?
they work somewhere without them.
or they're someone's friend.
if he won't learn coding, he'll at least learn that.
if that was really the sum of his motivation to learn to code then i agree he's a fuckhead.
but business people should know enough about the details of their business that they can smell bullshit.
ideally they know enough to hire people who can do the actual vetting for him... but if you hire a fake to hire other people then your tea is gonna suuuuuuuuuck why is my project late?
well *there's just too much flux in the mux!
"* i instantly assume anyone who uses the term "coder" is a fucking moron.
is that bad?
i just call you guys “code monkeys” and us designers as “pixel monkeys”.
although i just call the scary russian linux guy vlad since you should never fuck with the linux guy.
meh.
my chosen label is 'programmer', but i learned to accept 'coder', 'developer', 'engineer', 'code monkey'.
well, for new programmers learning, i don't think any teaching site actually uses the terminology in any significant way that outweighs the thought process: "hey, i'm writing code!
i'm coding!
i'm a coder!"
it's ignorance of a very forgivable kind, i think, simply because people aren't ever really taught it.
fucking hate those business side pricks who just wanna go get rich while shitting on others.
“i have people skills” i would rather shoot myself than work for a smug bastard who counters you every time by saying "i went to a code camp, i know what you're talking about, i know what's possible and what's not, so don't bullshit me."
lol give him that shit-eating grin everytime you see him.
maybe he'll catch on today one of the junior devs took on a bug, while i took on a different one a little later.
turns out, we were chasing the same underlying bug and we were done about the same time.
though my solution was slightly more robust he found the right solution to a tricky bug very quickly.
it made my day to tell him how well he'd done (and to send an email to our boss so she has it for his next review).
can you hire me pls?
it sounds so nice where you are.
it's an excellent place to work.
of course it's got its down points too, but overall, good place.
when i'm working as a mentor, or team leader, one of my rules is "don't be the reason that someone feels insecure."
[edit] wow, thanks for the gold!
i wish you were my boss.
that sounds great.
i'm a junior dev and i'm probably as insecure as it gets t_t i felt more secure / permanent at my current job after a bunch of people were hired and fired after me :d i'm a senior dev and most days i wonder a) why my shit works, b) why i still have a job, and c) i'm not really any good... but then my wife reminds me i busted and continue to bust my ass to stay current and my company had zero complaints... so don't worry.
you'll most likely be insecure in ten years.
i'm starting a senior position in the new year.
i'm really going to try and have the same attitude - it's hard because i can be really judgemental, but i'm going to try.
but did he properly comment his solution and push it to the svn with notes?
those would been the code review.
one extra commit.
that's how close.
it was a pretty darn good job.
you're a good boss.
what about a regression test?
test it in production and if it didn't regress, you passed the test!
&gt; test it in production &gt; implying there’s any other way to test if you're still using svn, something ain't right.
it was a good choice years ago, and everyone’s too busy to take the time to set up a replacement for a system that works.
at least that’s why i’m still on svn.
what do you mean by "push it to the svn with notes"?
are you talking about the commit message?
/r/wholesomeprogrammerhumor me: i added a new feature "i am the bug" this is outrageous!
it's unfair!
how can one fix a bug and not find another issue?
take a seat.
are you threatening me master programmer?
sales: "i found a feature" bizdev: “we’ll have that 9-month app to you in 30 days; including that feature!” we have had some core people leave a team last year, and now we actually do have the problem that we have features that the dev team doesn't know exist, but the sales people do.
it happens regularly that we break something that we didn't know existed.
_and_, we find features in the code that nobody knew existed (but that work fine).
we go looking for them and call it "feature mining".
we actually have a pile of shit that contains hidden gems.
senior devs are no mathematicians &gt;an astronomer, a physicist and a mathematician are on a train in scotland.
the astronomer looks out of the window, sees a black sheep standing in a field, and remarks, "how odd.
all the sheep in scotland are black!"
"no, no, no!"
says the physicist.
"only some scottish sheep are black."
the mathematician rolls his eyes at his companions' muddled thinking and says, "in scotland, there is at least one sheep, at least one side of which appears to be black from here some of the time."
physicist: we need to see at least 100000 sheep before we can make any statements about their color.
we assume all sheep are perfect black bodies, as this is in agreement with all observations so far.
this may be due to their lack of air resistance.
and white sheep are just black sheep going backwards in time.
that's why everything they do appears to be the opposite.
spherical sheep in vacuum.
engineer: let's make it 200000 just to be sure.
the economist can get in on that action too, but the sample has to be very diversified.
the arts major drew the sheep on a napkin another mathematician joke: someone asks a mathematician how to make tea.
the mathematician says: simple, it can be done in two steps.
you are in the living room, so first go to the kitchen, and then make tea.
says the other one: but how do i make tea once i'm in the kitchen?
simple, the mathematician says again.
go to the living room and use the previous solution.
senior dev: someone left the debug flag on.

a mathematician wakes up at night to see a fire in his bedroom.
he sits down at his desk, writes down a very elegant set of formulas and "q.e.d.

relieved, the mathematician goes back to bed.
i'm very much that mathematician.
wait, are chemists really supposed to be the ones that don't care how much of something they throw on a fire?
that seems... dangerous i prefer this version: a chemist wakes up at night to see a fire in his bedroom.
he fills a bucket with water, throws it on the fire and extinguishes it.
relieved, he goes back to bed.
a physicist wakes up at night to see a fire in his bedroom.

the punchline is left as an exercise to the reader i like this one less actually &gt;there is at least one sheep at least one sheep-like object junior dev: i fixed the bug and closed the ticket.
senior dev: i fixed a bug and opened up 10 other tickets for other bugs and refactoring that needs to be done.
oh god this is too real.
junior dev: this bug was caused because we didn't follow the latest standards in coding practices.
senior dev: this bug has always been there is a miracle this software worked at all, but then again it's a miracle we did this software in 6 months when we asked for two years.
good practice dev: i'd say we should cover all cases with tests.
*sprint deadline approaching* same good practice dev: no testing is required its a minor change.
oh it finally works, now i should refractor the code, check it doesn't interfere with this other function, also i am not sure it will cover this fringe cases, and i would like to move it in this other object because it would make more sense like that but .... oh, cool i see that now it works, here are three other priorities that have to be solved by last week.
junior: git commit -m "added feature to fix issue 42" senior: git commit -m "fix" &amp;&amp; git push origin release edit: &amp; -&gt; &amp;&amp; no, no, no it's: junior: git commit -m "added feature to fix issue 42" junior: ... junior: git commit -m "added feature to fix issue 42 (this time i promise)" junior: ... junior: git commit -m "added feature to fix issue 42 (this time i mean it)" ... til i'm a junior dev the senior dev probably does the exact same thing only squashes and merges their commits before pushing ;) aha yeah.
in my defense, this happens only when i have to immediately push for a rebuild in heroku or something that everyone is using as a test environment.
til i'm a senior dev git commit --amend you need another ampersand.
the push will start before the commit finishes.
git merge -s ours; git push -f junior dev: this solution will solve the issue senior dev: how many more issues will this solution create?
when you realize that the dev team has developed all 10 sites the business manages the last 7 years with error reporting suppressed the entire time?
all the issues.
all the issues in the world.
if you have no error reporting, your code is perfect and bug free!
better yet, if your unit tests start failing you should disable them instead of trying to investigate which change you're trying to deploy is causing it.
try { everything } catch (anything) { return success } my work group recently took charge of an existing asp net web forms application.
you won't believe it, or maybe you will, but every unmanaged exception is rethrowed as timeout exception.
looool coffee stain studios = i found a feature junior dev: "i hope nobody thinks this is my bug" senior dev: "these junior devs are useless" principal dev: "sorry guys, i fucked up.
here's a fix" til all principle devs/architechs at my organisation are senior devs jr: "it took me all day but it's fixed."

&gt; todo chase this up 12/3/2007 junior dev: "it compiled!
i'm done!"
senior dev: "it compiled... now for the hard part."
10x dev: i created a bunch of bugs senior dev: “i found” + (blame == me ?
“a” : blame + “‘s”) bug, and then i fixed it.
source: am senior dev edit: i don't seeaproblem not with that ternary operation ... in my experience devs that like to blame others are the worst, because they tend to spend more time trying to argue why it wasn't their fault or looking everywhere else other than in their own code and waste a lot of time defending their asses for no good reason.
i look for people that wil fix bugs not for people that will not create bugs.
as soon as someone says to me i fixed "jhon's bug" instead of i fixed "a bug" i immediately put a bug red cross on his name.
&gt; i immediately put a bug red cross on his name.
\*big red cross i fixed /u/lordamras’ bug.
cross that out bitch.
i prefer the nice middle ground "i found the bug we were looking for" junior dev: "i found the bug" senior dev: "i am the bug" at this point in my career i've spent some time in the industry doing sre, security, and compiler work.
sometimes i feel like i'm just being an asshole when i point out all the faults in a project that can cause crashes or be exploited.
as a result i tend to give conservative work estimates despite being a risk taker as person.
today i provided an estimate to the pm that something's simple enough and will only take a few minutes to do.
he joked that this is the first time i've ever said something was easy in the 6 months we've worked together.
:/ junior dev: "i found the bug" senior dev: "i stackoverflowed a bug" principal dev: i found a feature partner dev: let's build a division around this til one week makes you a senior dev.
senior dev: "what if i told you, all i see are bugs..." the real problem is when there's no bugs.
it's like this sub only has this one joke and you all parrot it over and over again señor dev: i found el buggo.

raw nudes what are those boxes ?
are they available online ?
i am not sure about the boxes or all of the complexity, but if you are just wanting to replicate the the led matrix it is likely a max7219 driver; these are very common in arduino setups.
just google that and you can even find pre-assembled kits.
i would also like to know me too me three, i've been wanting to venture into the world of hardware.
i've been afraid of spending a lot of money on something stupid but with this i could make the output for something else!

correct a+ for effort, but /r/memeeconomy would like a word good ole times when we still had 4:3 monitors... i member!

i don't know why this is on /r/programmerhumor but i agree that learn you a haskell for great good is easily amongst the best tutorials i have ever seen.
look at the calculator.
heh boobies.
nice.
*image transcription:* --- [*appears to be a tutorial for programming haskell.
to the side is a crudely drawn picture made in ms paint depicting a calculator upside down with 8008135 on the screen.
*] protip: it really helps to first think what the type declaration of a function should be before concerning ourselves with the implementation and then write it down.
in haskell, a function's type declaration tells us a whole lot about the function, due to the very strong type system.
cool.
when implementing a solution to a problem in haskell, it's also good to think back on how you did it by hand and maybe try to see if you can gain any insight from that.
here we see that we treated every number or operator that was separated by a space as a single item.
so it might help us if we start by breaking a string like "10 4 3 + 2 * -" into a list of items like ["1ø" , "4" , "3" , "+" , "2", "*", "-"].
next up, what did we do with that list of items in our head?
we went over it from left to right and kept a stack as we did that.
does the previous sentence remind you of anything?
remember, in the section about folds, we said that pretty much any function where you traverse a list from left to right or right to left one element by element and build up (accumulate) some result (whether it's a number, a list, a stack, whatever) can be implemented with a fold.
in this case, we're going to use a left fold, because we go over the list from left to right.
the accumulator value will be our stack and hence, the result from the fold will also be a stack, only as we've seen, it will only have one item.

i guess i am a psychopath... all c# developers are psychopaths source: i'm a c# developer yeah i was gonna say.. i write like a psychopath in c# and like the left panel in javascript.
anybody else switch up their coding styles depending on the language?
i like to follow the conventions associated with the language.
yeah i do this too.
at my old job we had a code base that had c++ and legacy c code in it.
we used different style guides so that you could always tell which one you were in.
the weird thing was that both did opening braces on a new line, but in c braces were indented to the level of the code they encapsulated.
i do that with my reply text color in outlook.
helps remind me where to look for things later.
you see, i had my memory removed so i could install digital memory.
yeah, i switch coding style either based on language or to match the style currently being used.
if you're following conventions, doesn't that make you *not* a psychopath?
first thing i do is switch vs autoformatting to the left-hand panel style.
but that's because **i work alone**... damn, maybe i'm a psychopath?
private int _value; public int value { get { return _value; } set { _value = value; } } yeah good forbid i prefer organize code and not a cluster of utter shit on my monitor i like doing it the psychopath way when i'm using a language that can get very nested.
i'm sorry same.
:( at least you're not alone.
i like the nice curly bracket, but my ide snippet is turning me into psychopath....^^^^^send ^^^^^help what about if(condition){a+=b;} what, are you one of those savages who writes all their code on one line?
~~well if it's a one-line function yes it's shorter and easier~~ [try me](https://my.mixtape.moe/bxvmhg.jpg) ninja: you can't see the scrollbar but it's damn long.
you monster lol i actually tried to use it.
i am not very smart.
i'm on mobile.
frick you i have that problem, too.
only when it's javascript await fetch('url').then(response =&gt; response.json()).then(data =&gt; data.payload); await fetch('url') .then(response =&gt; response.json()) .then(data =&gt; data.payload); looks way nicer though but that's more lines.
it'll take way longer to run!
it's a trade-off between code performance and programmer performance as seen by management (measured in sloc).
honestly i'd probably do a little of both.
await fetch(url).then(response =&gt; response.json()) .then(data =&gt; { valid_some(data); normalize_some(data); return data; }); because i more frequently need to do something with the result.
and sometimes i like to normalize my data before i do anything else with it because i've been infected by javascript frameworks.
and depending on the api, you probably want to check the status code.
my personal style is if it's a 200 you're going to have valid json.
if it's anything else it's probably going to be a plain text error string.
i like telling my users exactly what happened and the call stack in the error message is the only information they need to give me for me to find &amp; resolve the error.
but then at work we have either a 200 or a 500 but we don't really need to check the status code because the payload is always valid json no matter what and there is a status key that says ok or something else.
if it's not ok, the status is an error message.
if it is ok, go ahead and consume your json response.
= and then there's some fuck from internal who only serves a 200 no matter what happens, always serves a content type of application/json, and only sends us plain text.
it's a regex nightmare taking a guess at what a valid or invalid response is going to be.
or a handled or unhandled error from something from their server.
i agree that you probably want to do more with the data in fact i didn't really look at the code at all just the style.
personally for chained methods i like each "link" in the chain to be on a new line as it makes it more explicit.
people that return 2xx responses from failing apis are always wrong though!
no need for then when you use await: let response = await fetch(url); response = await response.json(); let data = response.payload; oh, interesting, haven't tried that.
i'm still relatively new to promises so i never thought to try that :p i had a guy in my class once who did that, and always in a crazy complicated way.
he'd do something super simple and it always looked like wizardry.
i was so jealous of his skills!
and then i learned that if it works the same, readability is supreme.
did he graduate?
because any sane prof would flunk him for that atrocity alone he did graduate, and i think he did get a job as a junior dev.
the instructor in the class gave him shit for it all the time though so maybe he learned better eventually?
that shit wouldn't fly at my place of work, that's for sure.
yet another injustice in this world at least it means we can be reassured that we're not *that* bad.
*looks at recently written code* speak for yourself should have seen me wrote a whole integration between 2 systems using `python -c "blah blah"` you could have saved yourself so much future headache by piping this integration setup into the python -c call.
but no.
you had to do it this way.
you *had* to in the days when programs were stored on tape.
luckily or us we're no longer in the dark ages.
there's no longer a reason to act like savages.
might as well write if(condition) a+=b; no ?
did.. did you just assume his programming language in c# you can do a += condition ?
b : 0; this is actually true for a lot of languages!
[ternary operators](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ternary_operation) if (condition) a+=b; is what caused apples [goto fail security bug](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2014/02/24/anatomy-of-a-goto-fail-apples-ssl-bug-explained-plus-an-unofficial-patch/) you need a space after your keywords here goes another dogma king damn psychopaths.
if (condition) a += b; vs default style master race no, because it's more likely to make a mistake in the future when you need to do more things in the same block.
that's maintenance's problem.
this makes sense especially if you have multiple cases of returns or easy operations.
makes it easier to read imo if(condition1){return true;} if(condition2){return false;} if(condition3){return......;} why not use ternaries?
return (cond1) ?
true : (cond2) ?
false : ...; nested ternaries are twice as hysterical in php: http://phpsadness.com/sad/30 people survive long enough to document/rant about this stuff?

?
(condition):a+=b; condition ?
a += b : asm("nop") that if statement knows it’s trolling.
even at the end it has a snarky smile just to piss you off ;} no it should be: if(conditon){a+=b;} agree.
if you can't even spell conditon you shouldn't even be at this party.
that is concise.
am ok with it cmon.. i can't even take you seriously right now.
absolutely barbaric a += b if condition what about if(condition) a+=b; what about that?
come on, don't be silly now.
real programmers use `a += condition ?
b : 0;` real programmers don't measure efficiency by input-characters.
if (a == b) { a = a + b; } the hitler of braces if (a==b) { a += b; } picasso.
more like dali i was thinking e.e.
cummings.
lol that's a genuine pollock `if` `(` `a ==b` ) ` {` `a += b;` } this is a new one the-i-wrote-my-code-in-notepad-code.txt i’ve seen waaay too much of this in interviews.
well... it could also be this: if (a!=b) { } else { a += b; } this literally made me twitch/slightly spaz out if ((a == b) == true) if(((a == b) == true) == true) try{if(a + 1 != b){if(b == a){if(a == b){try{if(b == a){if(b + 1 = a + 2 - 1){try{if(b == a || a == b || a + b != a || b + a == b){if((a != b) != false){while(a != b){if(a == b){if(a == b){while(a != b){try{if(if(if(((a == b) == true) != false) == true) != false)}catch{}}}}}}}}catch{}}}}catch{}}}}}catch{} in case there's an error wew lad if (a - b == 0) { a = a + a; } if ( a == b ) { a += b; } you're a monster!
also, in some languages you can't be sure if it will be interpreted as `(a - b) == 0` or `a - (b == 0)`.
whatever language you're talking about, it sucks.
these are the basics.
getting operator precedence wrong **so** badly is retarded.
name one of those languages i think i've encountered it in php.
i tend to go if (a - b == 0) { a = a + a; } this is the absolute worst, because it's *actually a standard*.
for (i=0; a - i == b; i++) {a++; if (a == 0) throw "stop inputting negative numbers!
"; while ((b - i) * a == 0) { a --; break 2; }} (that does exactly the same thing as yours) ...sorry i've seen worse... imagine all code indented by tabs, and all braces on the right side.
aligned together i too have seen this image https://i.redd.it/ev4bbol8rxsx.png someone really hates curly braces and semicolons that looks like someone tried to write python in a language that isn't python.
personally, i prefer the lisper style: int add (int a, int b) { return a + b;} bool ispositive (int i) { if (i &gt;= 0) { return true;} else {return false;}} int main (int argc, char *argv[]) { if (ispositive(atoi(argv[1])) and ispositive(atoi(argv[2]))) { printf("%i\n", add(atoi(argv[1]), atoi(argv[2])));}} i became physically distressed looking at that but....why no ide will have an auto formatting for that!
(i hope...) that almost made me physically gag a += a * (a == b) *furiously presses ctrl+k, ctrl+d* i had to adopt this coding style for my new job.
it was a real torture.
this style is seriously in our coding standards.
i hate it so much.
i think i'm going blind what the fuck did you just say to me you little shit?
ill let you know.. ...i graduated top of my class in the navy seals, and i’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on al-quaeda, and i... ... still don't know how to wrap things up. }
what about if (condition) a += b; *shivers* [so that's what we're going to do today?
](https://i.imgur.com/n33ulht.jpg) as a python programmer i will amuse the fight in the comments withs some popcorn your code won't run if you get an indentation wrong tho.
i know (very well).
so you never see working python script with ugly indentation.
something what makes me very happy you mean you *only* see working python scripts with ugly indentation.
how many spaces are equivalent to a tab?
some times 1, some times 2, some times 4, some times a random number just to align (word is terrible to write python code in) &gt; word is terrible to write python code in that's my biggest grief with python compared to other languages.
4 according to pep 8. some ides disagree.
i'm not really following.
4 is the official standard and to my knowledge is the most popular indentation level used.
some break that convention, but what of it?
&gt; some break that convention, but what of it?
not much.
was just pointing out some ides make python code ugly.
well, fair enough then.
nobody knowns.
but mostly 2 pep8 says 4. most of the editors i work with use 4 spaces.
2 spaces is too little.
some of my co-workers at a previous company used 8 space tabs while working with java.
that was madness.
this is the only reason i like python more than any other language.
the only language where there is no tabs vs spaces battle.
i've always used the psychopath option because it's far easier to read.
found the c# developer.
java guy here.
psycho path is best path.
java guy = psycho c guy, psychopath option is better, but yet i always use stroustrop-style braces.
turns a 10 line file into 30 pages of whitespace white space is important for clarity.
if it didn't matter, we wouldn't write using paragraphs.
i have no problem with either style, but i prefer the look of the latter.
it's immediately more legible to me.
i mean, i use whitespace to separate distinct sections of code, variable declarations are separate from variable initializations which are separate from running code, which are separate from console prints, etc.
but an if statement is directly related to the code within it, thus there is no separation between it and the actual code.
and the code it contains begins with an open brace, and ends with a close brace.
each have a line to themselves, creating a symmetrical visual boundary around the block of code.
it makes it easy to look exactly where the scope is by looking up and down the line, meanwhile with the first you have to try find a line which might end up being indented wrong and god help you if you accidentally write this: if (condition) a += b; } in the latter case it is immediately apparent.
in the former case, you're going to have weird errors originating toward the end of the file, and good luck visually scanning for that missing brace.
if indentation is a problem in identifying then neither style is going to be helpful.
but the latter makes it clear where the end of that scope is i'd rather have whitespace and make the code as easy to read and maintain as possible.
whitespace and readability is fine.. but there's also a line to be drawn for being excessive.
didn't realise you wrote your code on paper.
but i need to "save space" because my source files are 30 page monstrosities!
it's easy to see where you missed a brace.
second method is easier to read especially with nesting.
readability &gt; all.
if psychopats are the ones with wrong brackets, where does this fall to?
a += condition ?
b : 0; pictureofuniversebrain.jpg a += b * condition; a += b * (condition?1:0); a = (int[]){a,a+b}[condition]; the right one is the only right way.
ok guys, why is the psychopath version seen like that?
i honestly find it more readable and cleaner than having the opening bracket right after the condition.
everyone has mostly arbitrary and completely subjective ideas about this stuff then take it to be god's own truth.
there's a bunch of c# and java folks in this thread who like the psychopath move, same as you and i do.
&gt; everyone has mostly arbitrary and completely subjective ideas about this stuff then take it to be god's own truth.
this is the only truth in code styling.
oh, you mean if condition: a += b you did it backwards iprefer to use the twisted fucking psychopath bracket.
i c that you're not too # i was taught the style on the right in my class.
how common is it?
yea i also hate readable code omg eugh.
at least the right is consistent.
what's a conditon?
post is depracated, i changed my color scheme thanks for letting us know.
i know it's a joke and all, but i never really understood why people prefer the left one over the right one.
is it really a big problem if i prefer the psychopath way?
i know it spreads the code a lot but i don't get lost in it and it feels better :d can you have a problem at work or with some people just because of it?
porque no los dos?
i use the left one for 1-line ifs, and the right one for multi-line ifs.
also: thanks for twitching my ocd by misspelling "condition", op.
i like to solve problems like this by avoiding them: `a += condition ?
b : 0;` first one is ugly and unreadable.
2nd one is the only proper way to put brackets.
how is the first unreadable?
are you, as a fully alive human with human parts, whitespace insensitive?
cause real humans like me can tell that an indentation (((made with tabs))) means that that's within the method without any effort.
if the first is unreadable to you then you definitely have a mental condition k&amp;r 4 lyfe i like function foo(a, b) { if (a==b) { return true } return false } come at me that's... allowable?
"conditon".
am i the only one bothered with incorrect spelling of condition if it's only one line, i just skip out on the braces altogether.. i adapt to either language standard or company standard.
i've adjusted to whatever the ide (vs) wants for whatever language, so first for c# and second for javascript.
ow, my cancer *not all languages* i'm a .net full stack developer who uses both c# and javascript most days.
i have a mini argument in my own brain every time i decide to stick with convention and use the psychopath braces.
it feels wrong but i value consistent code.
they're called 'egyptian' brackets.
at least you get to use brackets.
i'll be over here using "endif endif" without ever learning what it means or why i always need 2 of them.
context.
it's all about context!
someone never heard of psr formatting standards :p call me a psychopath as well!
a += (condition) ?
b : 0;
*image transcription:* --- a detailed map of an island drawn in an old, treasure map style.
in the centre of the map, there are mountains labeled "graph data peaks".
flowing to the west, out of the mountains, are two tributary rivers.
alongside the river are locations labeled sparql, cypher, neo4j, datalog and datomic.
the rivers join to the west in an area called the relational empire.
the confluence of the rivers is called query planners.
from hereon, the river is named the declarative river.
it flows north through the relational empire to an estuary in an area labeled sql metropolis.
clustered around the estuary mouth are locations named postgresql, oracle and mysql on the western side, and sql server and db2 on the eastern side.
an old-style frigate is pictured leaving the estuary on a dotted line, labeled trading route, heading towards cape json on the north shore.
the northern region is called document data district.
a tributary river flows from the graph data peaks into the area with locations labeled css, xpath and rethinkdb on its banks.
this river flows to the northwest and joins the declarative river at the sql metropolis.
north of this tributary are three points, labeled ruins of xml databases.
from cape json on the north shore, a road leads south to locations named mongodb and couchdb.
these skirt north around a forest named mapreduce forest.
on the north shore, east of cape json is an isolated location named hyperdex.
two tributaries flow east out of graph data peaks and join before entering mapreduce forest.
in the peaks, there are locations alongside the tributaries named codasyl, titan and orientdb.
the northern tributary also has a location named ims, which is between the peaks and the forest.
the southern tributary flows through an area called key-value district and has a location named berkeley db on its banks.
the two rivers join before entering the forest, and the resulting river is named the imperative river.
it splits the forest in two and flows out to the eastern shore where it enters the sea as a delta.
to the south of graph data peaks is an area named the nosql danger zone.
this appears to be a marsh or swamp.
the key-value is to the east and has three locations on its south shore.
these are named voldemort, riak and aerospike.
the key-value district borders column-family district to the east.
this district comprises the southern part of mapreduce forest and has a location, just south of the forest, named hbase.
on its eastern shore, on the north bank of an estuary, is a location named cassandra.

this is the first page of an series of educational comics i will be making about programming.
someone from /r/comics suggested i crosspost this work to this subreddit, so i did just that.
if it isn't really meant to be here, i do apologize.
either way, i post all comic pages i finish to my own website: https://prairieworldcomicsblog.wordpress.com/ thank you for reading!
i teach stem (all round tech stuff including programming) and this is pretty much exactly how you end up explaining programming haha great to know i'm on the right track!
your welcome my welcome!
instead of "who is "you"", it should be asking "what's a "me"".
sudo make me a sandwich is this a 7 mb png??
0.o true, i might need to compress my work better for digital sharing.
i designed my work to be printed out on a whole sheet of letter paper, which is why it has a high resolution in the first place.
you have little bits of colour in there, probably from the scanner messing up.
if you convert the image you posted to greyscale it's only 2.7mb.
yeah, i noticed that, too.
i found that doing that and making it a slightly compressed jpeg file, i reduced the size down to 1.8 mb without even touching the resolution.
i'll be sure to do this on my next comic.
i always thought that if your child has one of those "career days" in school where all the parents come in to talk about their jobs, a fun activity might be to get the class to tell you how to, say, pick something up off the floor.
you would act like the robot and make them be very specific about what you have to do.
i've heard of similar things to this in creative writing, where the student has to write in incredible detail on how to make a pb&amp;j sandwich.
too bad the assignment never related this to programming - stuff like that would be good teaching tools there!

i've always wanted to learn basic.
gonna whip up a new game in html.
hello world simulator html can be considered coding.
it's not programming though.
even when you assume that was what they meant though: "apply coding skills to build an application" yeah good luck with that.
directly above that it mentions that the book covers 5 languages, not just html.
should be good enough to build some sort of interactive application.
hmm, i wonder what those languages are.
html, javascript, css, php, and... what else would you need?
if you have node you don't need php.
what the heck is the last language.
perl?
probably sql oh right, of course, a database language.
i looked it up.
its html, css, javascript, python and ruby hmm... probably would have been better if they had python &amp; sql instead of ruby on there.
then you could have data persistence.
and honestly i don't even know what ruby is for.
you could write a server with python or javascript, so what's ruby do?
ehh, maybe.
i'm just not sure why'd they would showcase html on the front of the book if it's main focus was on other languages.
unless of course the reason was that the person who designed the cover didn't understand that.
maybe the people who wrote this book don't share this sub's anti-html circlejerk?
this sub hates html?
after using native toolkits to draw rectangles that are 50% of the screen width or whatever i actually think css and media queries are a great way to handle displaying something for different screen sizes.
there's nothing wrong with html, but way too many people with little or no aptitude for programming brag about learning html, when any competent programmer should be able to learn the basics of it in few weeks without difficulty so like... you're expecting everyone to already be familiar with programming concepts?
don't knock people's accomplishments just because they would've been easy for you.
you're just being an asshole for no reason.
&gt; you're expecting everyone to already be familiar with programming concepts?
a society like that would yield world peace well with the current trend of kids being taught basic coding earlier and earlier in their education we might get there yet :d &gt; any competent programmer should be able to learn the basics of it in few weeks without difficulty fair enough, it doesn't do any computations and you could write the entire page as divs if you wanted.
css is where things get interesting.
okay.
why are you constantly assuming the makers of the book are idiots?
it's probably on the cover because it's likely the first language they'll cover.
i never said the makers are idiots, i said it's possible the graphic designer who made the cover didn't understand that html wouldn't be the focus of the book.
i mean you can build mobile and desktop applications with html, css, and javascript - not to mention web apps are also a thing.
they meant building an application on notepad silly *e l e c t r o n* but the top left says color.
are we color coding now?
👎 it comes with 5 coding languages!
technology has come so far!
how'd they get all that knowledge in such a small space?
i am profesinel programmar.
someaone plas to tech me how to make andriod apps with html.?
need to extend some cloud interfaces and integrate machine learning applications to scale you could either use a webview or use phonegap/cordova to build... i dunno what it is exactly, but it starts as html and ends up as a mobile thingy.
why is there html on the cover?
i thought it was about coding?
r/thatsthejoke i feel extra dumb today.
well, you know what they say, you bowl better with better bowlers.
who the hell says that?
some people i went bowling with.
looking at those meta tags, might be for front end oh hey the author has my namr coding is a sub-class of fishing.
til that there are knock-off "for dummies" books.
you could say that they are using it correctly, as html is needed for the front end, to prettify the output of the code.
this is definitely a front end.
html was a pretty effective gateway drug for me.
so i'm a little confused.
wouldn't the right-hand rule apply when talking about polar coordinates, not cartesian?
when referencing an array, it makes logical sense to access it like `array[y][x]` as that leaves each row as it's own array (some people actually store the contents of the array rotated 90^^^o , such that the access looks like `array[x][y]`) anyway, when defining methods (or even defining and initializing variables), i also order the arguments / variables as `methodname(int y, int x) `.
i dunno if that's the github guy's reason, but that's mine not necessarily.
cartesian coordinates are right-handed too.
comes up for thing like cross products.
not i don't know what this guy is on about.
the canonical ordering is correct for a right-handed coordinate system.
*image transcription: text* --- **additional notes** my consistent adherence to the right-hand rule with respect to coordinate vectors has led me to arrange all screen coordinate tuples in the order (y,x) rather than the more familiar (x,y) whenever possible.
i make no apologies for this, and anyone who has a problem with it is wrong and should feel bad.

](https://www.reddit.com/r/transcribersofreddit/wiki/index) i freaking do this all the f-ing time!
why doesn't everyone; it just makes logical sense first you go right, so you move along x then you go down so you move along y. not if you're doing an array access.
the order of array access is `array[y][x]` which means you also need to do for loops with the y iterator first (if you want to access it row by row, which you'll agree is typical behavior) for (int j = 0; j &lt; y; j++) { for (int i = 0; i &lt; x; i++) { array[j][i] = getvalue(y, x); the ordering here **has** to be (y, x) due to how arrays function.
-- unless you do the funky and have the array sideways in memory, `array[x][y]`, but that's just... ew -- so rather than constantly change the ordering of the indices `array[y][x] = getvalue(x, y)`, i decide to keep a consistent (y, x) rule across everything you know arrays don't actually have directions right?
that's just your brain.
the computer just sees a line of bytes, there is no grid.
you are a captive of your own mind.
you know indentations and other style guides don't actually matter, right?
that's just your brain.
the compiler just ignores all extra whitespace, there is no style.
we can do this with many things.
however, consistency is key for readable and maintainable code.
i don't really see redefining well-established coordinate systems as a key ingredient of readable, maintainable code but that's just me i guess.
my solution is to create an idiomatic data-structure instead of trying to force a lower-level abstraction into place.
create a 2d grid object with accessors and forget about the implementation for the rest of the development process.
if you need raw performance, you'll be using a 1d array anyway, which is harder to reason about.
in summer i made a project using lots of 3-dimensional vectors.
i stored them x, y z. good to hear there are some sane people here.
my brain is so small, it's not even on the scale.
i'd use an extension method i feel dumb... what’s an extension method?
you add the method to the datatype.
so you'd use bool b = true; print(b.invert(); ) and false will be printed i don't know if java can do that, but it's a very nice feature of .net at least java doesn’t have extensions.
you can do it in kotlin.
and in c# for 10 years now (`19 nov 2007`) i'm a bit lost, but isn't it posible to define new methods for data types using "extends"?
when you extend a class, you're introducing a new type.
whereas with extension methods, you can add new methods to existing types.
how is that a nice feature when you can do the same thing with `!`?
in the case of boolean an simple !
might be good.
but what if you want to translate an datetime from .net ticks to unixtime?
you could make a tickstounix(datetime dt) but wouldn't mydate.tounixtime be much more convenient?
that's what's extension methods are far that's what d's ufcs is for: https://tour.dlang.org/tour/en/gems/uniform-function-call-syntax-ufcs i don’t know if any languages that *don’t* have those to some degree, so i thought you specifically meant booleans.
no, you can put extension methods on every data type, you can even put it on interfaces, so everything that implements the interface gets the extension method.
you could, for example, put a extension method on ienumerable that removes the first n elements and basically everything that is some kind of list, like an array or dictionary can use the method to get rid of the first n elements so it’s monkey patching?
oh.
whoops.
well that’s before the first brain then, but doesn’t have enough brain capacity to display itself.
just always remember that extension methods are just static method calls.
use with caution.
but they are beautiful for javascript you can extend the prototype, for golang you can create a function with a receiver of the type you're extending dudes you don't have to use booleans if you just use strings with "true" or "false" in them but then you need error handling (if true elif false else as opposed to if else) type juggling with boolean to string sometimes yields "0" or "1" on some languages, at least on php (woops, i summoned a boogeyman) i literally worked for a large military producer where that was the case with a global function to convert between "bool strings" and actual booleans why do programmers write booleans in string form?
are they retarded?
&gt; are they retarded?
speaking from experience, it seems that way sometimes too bad there isn't some sort of boolean negation mechanic built into the language, removing the need for these functions.
one can dream [i wish there was one!!!1!
](https://media.giphy.com/media/87ddjlpawxvmu/giphy.gif) &gt; return !
(b); but... why the parenthesis?
is that not needed?
sorry, i’ve been doing a lot of bash recently and i’ve gotten used to putting parenthesis around everything.
invertbool() { rand="$((random % 2 + 4))" (([ "$(echo -n "$1" | wc -m)" == "$(echo -n "$rand")" ] &amp;&amp; [ "$rand" == "$((4+1))" ]) || ([ "$(echo -n "$1" | wc -m)" == 5 ] &amp;&amp; [ "$rand" == "$(echo -n "$((~$(echo "(4 - 1)" | bc)))" | cut -c 2-)" ])) &amp;&amp; echo "$(echo -n "true")" || echo "$(yes "false" | head -n 1)" } aw man... i would even know where to start on trying to figure out how that works... mid-way through development?
even then i could barely, either.
it was a pain to debug why it kept giving me random answers.
finally it works though.
it's perfect!
...yes, perfect.
you only need it if you're inverting the result of a more complex argument (it's kind of like how it works in math).
return !
(b); works but is bad style return !
(b &gt; a &amp;&amp; c &gt; a) also works, and ends up being a matter of preference.
i might do that if i'd had the same test earlier in an if/else that wasn't inverted ... although if it was a method i might just call it and invert the result of that instead.
in the words of lisp, why not parentheses?
glad i'm not the only one!
haha i've seen a?false:true in production code.
that's pretty similar to #2 though.
another one try { char c = b.tostring().charat(5); return true; } catch (indexoutofboundsexception e) { return false; } that’s clever, i didn’t think of that.
aren't char arrays zero-based?
i guess i did make that mistake.
actually... i was making an 1 based array joke like you always see in here.
i'll go with that answer.
classic!
we're going back to that topic now?
b \^= true dang i wanted to post this one.
found the hardware guy hah, yes.
embedded is life.
having fun with microchip pics was the best before i turned to networking.
fuck, that's where i went wrong.
i'm lucky that i get to work with atmel avrs and ti msp430s at my job.
&gt; graduating as technician in electronics this month came here to see if anyone else thought the same duh, you just need to write two functions... public function inverseboolpositive(bool){ return false;} and public function inverseboolnegative(bool){ return true;} seems legit.
what are these brain and weird light images called?
i'd love to make me such memes expanding brain memes you didn't use a `boolinverserfactory` ?
what a half-baked solution.
what about... !b just that?
sorry, i’ve been doing a lot of bash recently.
i’m used to putting parentheses around that sort of stuff.
!
(b) was the first one i tried, and it worked, so i didn’t even consider that i didn’t need parentheses.
no i meant, couldn't you just say !b (or !
(b)) to get the opposite of b?
rather than having to write and call a method?
oh, right.
well i mean i guess you could but the brain would be too small :p god i fucking love these like it or not, the last one is definitely the fastest.
in most of your code, an input of "true" will still return "true", because it checks if its true, then changes it to false, and then right after that it checks if it is false, and then changes it to true.
so i had a detailed reply about how every one of them worked, but i deleted it accidentally, so here’s the tl;dr version: i’ve tested all of them and apart from the last one (obviously) they all work.
any time i’m changing a value by testing that same value, it’s in an if/elseif statement, meaning that the elseif won’t be run if the if statement evaluated as true.
the ones i'm talking about were not else ifs which ones are you talking about?
the 3rd and 4th picture in both of those, *b* is being tested in the if statement, and *newbool* is being set.
*b* is never changed, and *newbool* is never tested for.
ah, you are correct.
my apologies no worries man.
the aim was to make them look convoluted and inconvenient, so... mission success?
skip to the last one, its the unofficial tl:dr assert(b == true); return true; here is an easy one liner return (int)b.tostring().charat(1) == 65; ironically, the last version is how you win a programming competition.
tough problem to do some big operation that results in true or false?...just pick one, submit...when it fails submit with opposite.
came in second to this crap back in the day.
anything taking place in fixed environment like college and competitions are a joke.
public static boolean inverseboolean(boolean b) { return (boolean) new logicaloperators.builders.booleanmanager().withconfiguration(logicaloperators.standards.boolean_inverter).withoption("boolean", b).build().run().getresult(); } code is always built on existing code, therefore we can use the combined efforts this community has already provided to expand: return !
iseven(string.valueof(b).length()); edit: missing parenthesis, thanks dino i think you forgot a parenthesis at the end there.
parser will be unhappy.
what about: public static boolean inversebool(boolean b) { boolean newbool; if (b == true) { newbool = false; return newbool; } else if (b == false) { newbool = true; return newbool; } } that way there's no potential use of initialised variable so no need for the inline initialisation.
why do you need this when you can just !b karma.
i saw an example online recently where they used b ^= true to do this.
smh.
convert to 1/0, do a plus one with modulo so that a 2 ticks over to 0. much easier.
love the second last one who the fuck writes a function to return the inverse of a boolean!!
&gt; jackiechanwtf.png people who want karma on /r/programmerhumor like me.
achievement unlocked public static string inversebool() { string str = "false"; // 50/50 chance that the ouput is true return str; } the last option works if i write unit tests that passes true to the function.
git push -f return !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!b oof hey, how about using !b in your code in the first place?
the 5th one should use `!==`, not `!=` edit: i’m an idiot.
this was written in java, and i know js also uses !=.
i don’t do much c, but which language uses !==?
java uses !== for evaluating the expression into boolean.
edit: am an idiot.
it is != does it?
hm.
well != worked for me.
i’m an idiot.
i guess i’ve been looking at too much js lately.
it is !=.
sorry for that... all good, we all forget sometimes :) !== is usually used for untyped languages to do typed comparisons.
most dynamically typed languages do automatic type switch when comparing variables so that "1" as string will be equal as 1 as int, that might pose some problems in some cases, especially when comparing booleans for example in javascript 1 is evalued to the boolean true.
1 != true | false 1 != 1 | false 1 == true | true 1 == 1 | true 1 !== true | true 1 !== 1 | false 1 === true | false 1 === 1 | true
often you'll hang multiple copies of yourself simultaneously well, yes.
why would it be a defined behaviour if it is an obvious bug and should never be written in the first place.
if standard would define that behaviour, it would mean that that is no longer a bug.

`&amp;nbsp;` is called a non-breaking space.
in html (the skeleton of webpages), multiple consecutive spaces get compressed into one space.
example: `hello world` -&gt; hello world.
notice how the 4 spaces got turned into 1 space?
to avoid this, you use `&amp;nbsp;`, which among other things makes the spaces not get compressed.
example: `hello&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;world` -&gt; hello&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;world.
the reason why using `&amp;nbsp;` is a bad idea here, is because css (the styling of webpages (things like color, font, etc.))
is a *much* better tool for this.
i hope i helped!
:) unsure if you're joking or not, however, it's just plain html in the screenshot, text editor colors may throw you off.
not joking, just not familiar with html.
what are they trying to do here?
pretty much they are using spaces for formatting instead of css layout.
now explain to him what's a css layout.
counter strike source right?
css is counter strike source, it should be pretty common knowledge... i heard css is black magic.
`&amp;nbsp;` represents a non-breaking space.
consecutive spaces get concatenated to single space in html so innovative (read inexperienced) developers use this character to force wide spaces.
this is most often used to create a double space.
the op's example is an entirely different level of ludicrous.
i forget the name so i’m gonna say wysiwyg text editor we’re they using that?
i hate using that and always go for the html editor.
this is probably whats going on, the ux guy just hit enter until the thing go to where he wanted it.
wouldn't hitting enter register a &lt;br/&gt; i believe there's a &lt;pre&gt; tag for preformatted text and he could have also used css.
or go old school and just do: ``` &lt;table&gt; &lt;col width="100"&gt;&lt;col width="500"&gt; ... &lt;/table&gt; ``` the image transcription guy's like "fuck this one".

you forgot vertical photo using a potato flip phone.
you forgot taking a screenshot, then taking a blurry picture from a phone, then taking a picture of the phone with an actual camera, then printing out the jpeg from the sd card of the camera, then faxing it to you.
after it's scanned into your computer, you need to insert the image into a .docx file (off-centered like crazy, of course) and attach that to an email.
you forgot to print the docx and then scan it again as a pdf before attaching it to a mail i don't know how common this truly is, but i have clients that do the last one.
print it, write on it with sharpie, and then scan it back in.
just had a ticket opened with the screenshots being scanned in print outs of screenshots in black and white you forgot the photo with flash to the screen.
i had someone complain about the color of a button.
they took a screenshot, printed it out in black and white, circled it with a red marker, and scanned it back in.

it says to look at the inner exception for more details.
the inner exception is empty.
i don't think it would have an expand arrow if it was null.
either shopped or i'm wrong.
or there should be another property in the exception that points to the database exception which also has an innerexception with the database error.
i remember the actual database error message to be pretty deep into the tree of the exception thrown.
not shopped.
expand it and it does nothing iirc 😂 turns out the entity framework model was a bit squiffy (technical term).
every time i see this kind of error it's always entity framework.
and they're rarely using mssql.

its as soon as you try to use decimals like 0.1 (stored as 0.100000000000000005551115123126), or something that can only be formed with using it, like 0.3, etc.

0.1111111...), you have to truncate at some point, and that gives you a very slightly different value when you convert it back in decimal for display/calculations.
example: 0.3 is converted to 0.01001100110011... in binary, so if you were to truncate this to 0.01001100110011, you'd get 0.299988. the truncation depends on how many bits you use for storing the mantissa.
i.... don't actually know.
i think it has something to do with how computers represent decimals as "floating point" numbers.
read about there [here.
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/floating-point_arithmetic) [=====big link for mobile users=====](https://m.wikipedia.org/wiki/floating-point_arithmetic) for those questioning how floating point works, have tom scott: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzri1ifsty0 it's a problem with ieee 754 floating point numbers.
which is what virtually everything from your phone to your desktop uses.
calculators like the ti calculators use bcd for decimal math without the rounding errors you run into with base 2. x86 also has some support for bcd as well.
part of it is just the lack of precision with floating point numbers as well.
you lose even more precision with bcd as you use 4 bits to hold only a single digit of base 10. for those questioning how floating point works, have tom scott: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzri1ifsty0 python actually has the [decimal](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html) module which fixes this problem.
highschool physics is a bitch for this too true i always upvote review brah.
code review brah okay, webassign a perfect 7.0 out of 10.
“10.” as a float or “.” as period?
asking the real questions here "7" could mean anything from 6.5 to 7.4. you mean from 7.0 to 7.99999... the general rule is "plus or minus the smallest unit specified".
though you'd hope no one rounded down from 7.5. no, he means 6.5 to 7.4 learn the definition of significant figures i am referring to casting a double or float to an int.. dude what do you even program, bro?
not enough to get this reference.
casting a float (decimal value) to an int (integer value) will truncate the decimal part, basically performing a floor operation rather than a round.
only when you use math.round().
when casting the guy below is right, 7.0 to 7.999.. it's a float brah *image transcription: youtube comment* --- **kabsef** "a 7.0 out of 10."

i have had this mug for over 35 years now.
it used to my father's and i thought i would share it with you.
here's the text, to save you the trouble of reading it off the mug: **laws of computer programming** - any given program, when running, is obsolete - if a program is useless, it will have to be documented - if a program is useful, it will have to be changed - any program will expand to fill any available memory - the value of a program is proportional to the weight of its output - program complexity grows until it exceeds the capability of the programmer to maintain it - make it possible for programmers to write in english and you will find out that programmers cannot write in english **weinberg's law** - if builders built buildings the way programmers wrote programs, then the first woodpecker that came along would destroy civilization **hare's law of large programs** - inside every large program is a small program struggling to get out **troutman's programming laws** - if a test installation functions perfectly, all subsequent systems will malfunction - not until a program has been in production for at least six months will the most harmful error then be discovered - job control cards that cannot be arranged in an improper order will be.
- interchangable tapes won't.
- if the input editor has been designed to reject all bad input, an ingenious idiot will discover a method to get bad data past it - machines work, people should think **golub's laws of computerdom** - a carelessly planned project takes three times longer to complete than expected.
a carefully planned project will only take twice as long - the effort required to correct the error increases geometrically with time.

:p type inference is amazeballs.
type inference can handle most of the busywork.
and now that the types are known, you can autocomplete everything.
types are also much terser than doc comments.
if you want to document the types, type annotations do this better.
finally, you need fewer unit tests to reach the same level of confidence.
you don't need mindless tests which exercise each and every line for the sake of triggering potential runtime errors.
also, getting immediate feedback is really nice.
it's true that types aren't absolutely necessary, but they really do make things easier and more manageable.
i prefer having types even if i'm on my own and even if it's a rather short 100-line script.
just recently i jumped back into one of my older ts fun projects which i had ignored for about a year.
if so much time has passed, it might as well have been written by someone else.
thanks to the types, i got quickly back on track.
apparently, the last time i was in the midst of renaming some field but didn't went quite through with it for whatever reason (i probably did this on the train).
well, the editor told me to fix that so it wasn't an issue at all.
i was also able to quickly fix a bunch of null-related issues of some capability of my library which i haven't even tried yet.
feels good, man.
you are not a real programmer if you dont want to waste hours rerunning your program over and over to find out what the hell is wrong with it /s love the sad fish on the right.
nice touch x) i literally just went and read every page on that site after seeing this here.
lol.
these are great eli2 pls, not a programmer here compile error = you write some code and then you "compile" it to get an executable file (for example "program.exe").
the compiler, which "translates" the program, finds an error (for example a spelling mistake) and tells you "hey, i can't translate your program, i don't know what your code is supposed to mean".
your code never compiles and therefore you can't run the program.
runtime error = your code compiled successfully but it encounters at runtime (= after you executed it).
for example: you create a law "when someone dies, then the first child of that person gets all the money".
when you run the program (or your law is in place) it works fine but when someone dies and didn't have children, then the computer tries to give the money to the first child but there is no first child and the computer doesn't know what to do -&gt; you encounter an error and your program crashes.
tl;dr: compile error = error that makes it impossible to create the program, runtime error = error that occurs when the program is executed (usually only in some situations) you left out the joke part, which is that runtime errors can wreak havoc on your program before crashing, while compiler errors usually stop you before you can create havoc.
basically this.
imagine if the location where the first child was supposed to live, there was instead a highly sterilized wing of a hospital, and your computer just dumped tons of dollar bills contaminated with germs into it because that's where the first child would be located if one existed (but it previously put a hospital there because it knew you didn't have any at some earlier point in the program running).
thanks, i get it.
compile error = can't get into car runtime error = doesn't know what to do and therefore crashes car 👌 compile error = car sputters when key turns runtime error = breaks fail while on the freeway so a programmer walks into a foo... runtime looks to be the work of the mob [really good and kinda funny.

psh, all my editors convert tabs to spaces.
because i'm not an animal.
it's 2017. what kind of cavemen do the indentation on their own and don't it automatically?
my coworkers that is bad.
but it could be worse.
you could have co-workers that don't know how to use git.
we have one of those too, but he's getting better with it.
far fewer merge conflicts these days.
i simply let vs code format everything he does, lint it all (to make sure i catch all my mistakes) and push it back immediately and tell him to pull before he has a chance to add anything new.
he's so used to the process, he stops working until i tell him to pull.
i think he thinks pull-commit-push-pull is the normal way to use git now.
bro i am in the opposite situation.
until a few weeks ago, i was the only one in my quasi-team who knew how to use git.
i had two of my teammates discuss a way to cooperate and they suggested google docs.
i mean i know that it is supposed to be a research institute and that most are not programmers (although one of the two that suggested git was a computer engineer) but come on.
meh, following prescribed formatting standards even when you don't necessarily agree with them is something you're most definitely going to have to do in any programming career.
may as well learn it early... &gt; indention problems will be penalized heavily!
unlike spelling problems apparently *image transcription* --- watch out for correct indenting!
by now, you should know how to properly indent a program and therefore, **indention problems will be penalized heavily!
** do not use the spacebar to move lines into their proper positions.
instead, use the tab key.

direct copy of /u/squrr1's post that was 2 hours older than yours.
smooth criminal.
nice username.
i actually hadn't read their post when i wrote mine.
4 spaces?
two spaces is the only true indentation let's use three spaces then, and add a leap-space every seventh line.
so everyone is really unhappy - the true essence of any compromise.
two seems too little to me unless you're going to have a lot of nested shit that's still going to create a source file that is obnoxious to navigate.
i like to mix tabs and spaces, i also like to hurt puppies.
i use 8 character tabs i use the tab key, but deducting points for using it is a bit much… yeah, the guy is an ass.
he’s the kind of professor that you get salty about when you realize you’re paying for this class.
he relies too heavily on a service called mimir.io to automatically grade our assignments.
output has to be correct down to the new line character and spaces, and it tends to not give enough information when you get something wrong.
could be worse, our school has started using mindtap for python, and you have to type the program in their editor.
if it's not correct and you have to fix it, it looks like you can go back and edit the code, but it keeps running the first code you wrote.
so, if you write it incorrectly the first time, you have to close out of the lesson and reopen to try again.
why is academic software so consistently shitty?
because the people using it have no say in what gets used.
because the customers are not the users.
because they don't pay enough for proper support because it's written by academics?
fuck mindtap.
is this kind of bull shit software common in other countries?
i'm studying computer science in germany and never had to deal with something like this.
basically there are two kinds of assignments, the ones you have to do (to be able to take part in the exam) and the ones you should do.
every assignment i've submitted was either on paper or as source code (in algorithms and data structures it was ok to submit at least c++, java and c#, maybe more).
the submitted assignments are then checked by either the professor or an assistant.
the exam then is programming on paper.
kinda annoying but you're not going to lose points for wrong indentation and missing newline.
most important point is that you understand how the language works or how the algorithm/data structure works.
so for example a single missing ';' shouldn't cost you any points.
if you forget the ';' all the time, you don't seem to understand its importance and therefore lose points.
same for typo in variable names or something.
that sounds wonderful.
the first day of this class, the professor said, “this is not a java class, this is a programming class taught in java.
the important part is learning to think about algorithms.” the first test was filled with java specific, or could be java specific, questions.
i’ve been programming for a few years and got a 66 on that test.
the questions were mostly things that i would just run through the compiler if i ever needed to know.
like what does a boolean value print to the console?
who the fuck prints a boolean value to the console for anything other than testing?
i’d rather be tested on concepts than memorizing that kind of crap.
wow that sounds really bad... like "this is not a c++ class, [...] learning to think about algorithms.
what does the c++ standard say about the complexity of std::stable_sort()?".
the answer "o(n * log(n))" would of course be false because the c++ standard says that std::**stable_**sort() may run in o(n * log^2 (n)) except additional memory is available only then its o(n * log(n)).
i've learned c# but haven't used it in quite a long time and my knowledge about java is very limited (its similar to c# terms of syntax though).
my main focus currently is on c++.
...honestly i would most likely fail such a java focused exam.
about the boolean question.
i would assume that is either "true"/"false" or "true"/"false" but how should i know (and why should i care) which one it is?
edit: typo java documentation says that a primitive boolean will get a default value of false, but the compiler always complains anyway if you don’t initialize with a value.
😂🔫 oh god.
i took an intro ee course last year and had to do bullshit like this with matlab... i was seething that entire term.
he also did live coding demos that most of the engineering students would bomb.
i was a double major in cs so i didn't sweat it and even did one high because i was like fuck it, i have no respect for this shit.
i passed every single one of his challenge problems and he hated my code.
he would just say "it's ugly!"
and i would think to myself for fucks sakes it god damn matlab.
then he would just shoo me away as the rest of the students mostly bomb his tests.
now, use yaml in one of your assignments.
tbh, yaml is not as good as it looks.
and this is one of the reasons.
&gt; not as good as it looks in space, no-one can hear you tab.
&gt;indention how archaic it’s the south.
i’ve stopped expecting teachers to speak in a manner most would consider correct.
this dude just makes up words most of the time.
i prefer tab to produce a tab character such that i can change the amount of space a tab does appropriately.
and for performing any regular expressions when the need may arise.

my first thought of "oh that poor person has no idea what they're doing" was nearly instantly displaced by "oh god, some poor team is going to end up with this person as a coworker" looks like high school programming.
did this last year.
we would do this and have to solve it.
many student's either didn't care about programming (bludge subject) or didn't understand it.
a cs degree would fix this hopefully.
as someone who is new to programming, this doesn't really make much sense.
(by new i mean absolute noob).
my friend would have trouble understanding int[] = {1,3,4,2,7} a cs degree won't fix anything i wish i was "smarter" while i was taking hs cs and took it seriously upon myself.
i've always been interested in programming but never went through a formal education of it, so i just ended up being a vba junkie and just recently graduated to a python script kiddie.
i've had a ton of fun messing around figuring out how to achieve my end goals, and when my projects get finished there's this awesome sense of achievement.
i'm sure i would have been a professional developer by trade if i were to finish my cs studies back in hs and pursed it in university.
in my defense, the hs cs teacher was a complete turn off.
literally never taught anything of use, everything is "self-evident" and "you can reference that in the text-book".
doesn't teach you the logic or methodologies behind the codes.
the final project was just a game that he doesn't even check - everybody just copied game source code online and then submitted, and nobody failed.
of course he's not completely to blame - that's why i said i should have been "smarter" to take it upon myself to keep pursuing that road.
but alas, i was young and stupid and had other more important "interests" at heart at the time if you know what i mean... in australia we don't have hs cs.
it's called software development (at least in victoria) and yes it teaches you basic basic code and sorts like quick sorts etc.. but the amount you learn is not even close to actually being able to use it for anything other than little school tasks.
a cs degree is needed here to get into the lowest programming because there is no lower level.
this hurts me on a fundamental level.
that would be because it's wrong on a fundamental level.
and pretty much every other level.
putting the mental in fundamental.
how do people arrive at something like this?do they write down the entire program without once double checking their expectations?
i choose to believe this is a troll.
they didn't even clue in when their sorted list wasn't the right length.
maybe he/she wants to sort only the first 5 numbers, have you thought of that?
off course not, because you only think of yourself, eh.
what i guess happened, the first `while` never terminates due to the semicolon, so the op never got to see his incorrect for-loop.
then started fucking about without knowing what he's doing, giving up, and posting it to so.
so i fear this might not be a troll.
or it ended as soon as he set the swapped variable that's supposed to be true in order for his while loop to function, to false right at the start.
no, it enters an infinite loop on the line `while (swapped == true) ;`.
why?
because that makes it practically the same as the following: bool swapped = true; while(swapped == true) { } { swapped = false // for loop, rest of the code, etc, etc. }
// the printing for loop as you can imagine, it never gets past the first while loop.
ohh, ok, my bad.
good explanation.
pack it up folks.
we were wrong all along.
arrays start at -1. well duh, that's how many points he got from this post.
hey, it all works out then, right?
time to change the expanding brains, bois `$[ = -1;` was actually valid perl with that effect.
if gcc thinks your array will only ever need 16 bytes, then you can go all the way to -16. i know this because a student did this and managed to not have any issues.
took an hour of messing around with gdb to figure out what the fuck gcc was doing.
i dont even know c (only java so far) and its painfully obvious this dude has no ides what hes doing the actual swapping is the funniest thing about this though does anything actually get swapped?
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) even is there was no semicolon after while, the first thing he looks up it number[-1] so yeah... and even then he changes temp to number[i] instead of number[i] to temp (i'm guessing that's what he meant to do?)
this is c#, not c c# and java are actually pretty similar.
or &gt; while (swapped == true); &gt; swapped = false; no i think that's legit (well except the while line is two kinds of bad).
though a do-while might be a better choice.
looking at it again, yes, you're right.
isn't that part actually alright?
he is just saying that if there was a swap made previously (i.e.
if not all numbers are in order), go through and check again, and stop when no swaps are needed yes, you are correct.
that was my bad.
*image transcription: stackoverflow* --- **bubble sort that organises numbers in order**, -1 points, submitted by **shaan kulkami** int[] number = { 5, 3, 8, 1, 19, 12 }; bool swapped = true; while (swapped == true) ; { swapped = false; for (int i = 0; i &lt;= 4; i++) { if (number[i - 1] &gt; number[i]) { int temp = number[i - 1]; temp = number[i]; swapped = true; } } } for (int i = 0; i &lt;= 4; i++) { console.writeline(number[i] + " "); } what i am trying to do is get a simple bubble sort that organises numbers in numerical order.

that would be a challenge.

there are at least 10 things wrong with this at a cursory glance.
probably more given a bit of time.
this should be an intern coding quiz to fix this code.
if they don't laugh within 5 seconds they don't get the job.
i might have only been doing c# for 3 months, but even i can see how bad that is.
you don’t need to know c# to understand this.
other than the console.writeline and the array declaration it’s all valid (nonfunctioning) c. follow up question, how much of a difference is there between c# and c++?
i've heard that c# is closer to vb in some respects, but then again i'm still in school so i realize i know less than i did a month ago.
in syntax it's very close to c++ (except for a few differences - there is no :: and .
and -&gt; just ".
", array prefix belongs to the type, not the name, etc.).
however, there are many differences otherwise.
for one, c# is **heavily** object oriented to the point that the only way to program in a non-oo way in it is to dump everything into the class that contains the entry point.
heck, even integer is an object.
it's also a higher level language, which has consequences like not being able to use pointers directly.
unfortunately i don't know very much about c++ so i can't compare them in depth, these are just the few things i have come across since i'been using c++.
&gt; for one, c# is heavily object oriented to the point that the only way to program in a non-oo way in it is to dump everything into the class that contains the entry point.
that was the most glaringly stupid thing with java, why keep it?
well, i don't see that much of a problem with that.
most (if not all - with the exception of personal helper utilities written for yourself) real world programs are big enough that they are worth splitting into multiple classes anyways.
i think a good reason why you can't just dump your functions and variables directly into namespaces is to keep a clear distinction between the function of a namespace and a class or struct, thus keeping a clear structure.
in c# it's always namespace --&gt; any number of classes or structs --&gt; functions or variables.
java f#cked this up badly, you start with a package, then a class, then any combination of classes, anonymous classes, variables, and functions nested inside each other.
which is good if you want flexibility as to how you write your code (which java failed to provide, for example a lack of an event system forces you to create anonymous classes anyways, there goes the flexibility...) but not if you want to be able to actually read others' code or your own code 3 months later.
tbh i don't know a thing about c# and it still hurts my brain to look at that code is that how arrays are done in c#?
yes.
that's about the only correct thing in this code.
i used to tutor intro cs and looking at this code gave me some flashbacks.
sometimes you just don't even know where to begin... on seeing this i would recommend starting out by leaving the room to scream for a minute and two, then return once you've calmed down.
when in doubt, begin at -1. from scratch the worst part is the author may have used the reset button to stop the program.
i don't think i've ever facepalmed this many times in my life what am i missing?
why is everybody circlejerking over this?
almost none of it works, the while loop is empty (the semi-colon), it's only sorting 4 numbers from a 6 number array, it's trying to access the element [-1] of the array, it's not swapping anything and instead setting temp to a number then a different number.
on a positive note, at least it's o(1).
it's o(inf) i think.
forgot about the infinite while thingy.
as long as you accept that o(infinity) is the same as o(1) what else is wrong besides the semicolon and the -1 index.... well, for a start, the list never gets sorted at all.
the variable "temp" is set to the previous number in the array, and then immediately set to the current number, and then nothing is actually done with the variable, and the program just claims that the number is now sorted.
also, the while loop will never end if the numbers are already sorted, and it pointlessly sets "swapped" to false on every single loop, even though "swapped" would have to *already* be false in order for the loop to even loop again.
the program also only checks the array through index #4, instead of through the entire length of the array, and if the array is less than 4 it will still try to check everything up through the 4th index.
there's probably more too, but i know essentially nothing about any of the c languages besides the basic grammar.
i mean, the semicolon ensures that the horrible mess of code that comes after never actually runs as its stuck in an endless empty while loop.
that's probably the best part of this program.
thanks for the info!
that would explain why the poster didn't mention anything about array out of bounds exceptions.
&gt; and it pointlessly sets "swapped" to false on every single loop, even though "swapped" would have to already be false in order for the loop to even loop again.
to be honest i use this pattern all the time.
keep_doing = true while (keep_doing) do keep_doing = false for i in some_array do if some_condition(i) then keep_doing = true do_something_on_element(i) end end end usually this is how i tell the computer, "okay, keep on going through this array and as long as you find this condition met on at least one of the elements, keep on iterating over the array until none of the elements satisfy this requirement."
sure it wastes a single instruction, but i find it a lot more readable than other methods.
how would you perform the above task?
i know a do ... while loop can be used to be *ever so slightly* better, but the language i'm working in (lua) doesn't have a do ... while.
only a repeat ... until, which if you try to implement it with a repeat until, you get keep_doing = false repeat for i in some_array do if some_condition(i) then keep_doing = true do_something_on_element(i) end end until not keep_doing and as you see, the 'until not keep_doing' is a bit bothersome.
swapped isn't a useless variable, except in the context of the extra ; after the while.
in a properly functioning sort it would stop the loop early if a full passthrough happened without a swap, indicating that the list was already sorted.
swapped wouldn't have to be false for it to loop again, and in fact if it were false it would not loop, again assuming the issue with the semi-colon is resolved.
easy solution: int[] number = {5, 3, 8, 1, 19, 12}; number = {1, 3, 5, 8, 12, 19}; rip formatted nicely though the console.writeline in the ending for loop isn't indented consistently with all the other lines of code.
so not even formating.
i think he intended to use console.write(number[i] + " "); to write all numbers sorted on a single line vs's standard settings pretty much force you to use ms styleguide conform formatting isn't it great?
disclaimer: if this program isn't working as expected, it's not the program's fault; it's the user.
it's not me, it's you.
no u me too thanks extensive tests have shown that the problem appears to be between the chair and the keyboard.
id-10-t error has occurred i thought it's because you can't compile paper that is what i was thinking... needs to check user input ah, usersort is surely the most reliable of sort functions.
it is especially effective at context dependent alphanumeric sorts the best way to sort strings that cant be sorted correctly by the default comparator is to change your naming convention so that it can someone has a little too much faith in users ;) it is o(n) actually, it's o(user).
o(shit) me_irl when i am user it's a lot of things, but if you think it's the "most reliable", you've clearly never done desktop support.
also demonstrates efficient use of available compute resources no credit.
the question asked for psuedocode and this guy gave valid python.
isn't that the same thing though?
the difference between pseudocode and python is `chmod +x` i need this on a t-shirt!
the difference between python and pseudocode is .txt vs .py i too put shebangs in my pseudocode.
can you explain what that means?
i've only dabbled in python.
python's syntax is very simple and user-friendly and so the joke is that you could just write pseudo-code and it would compile without errors.
yeah i get that part; i just don't understand what the chmod +x part refers to.
gotcha.
it's a linux terminal command.
chmod +x [filename] allows a file to be executed like a program.
edit: further explanation- so you could write code as a .py file then use chmod so you could run it from the terminal you need to add line at the beginning of file that tells shell what interpret to use.
but basically yes.
it's setting the executable bit in the unix file system making it possible to run the program.
you might have seen files starting with something like "#!/usr/bin/env python".
this is called a shebang and indicates to the operating system which interpreter to run the program with.
if you set the executable bit and the shebang it's possible to start a program which is for example written in python without specifying the interpreter on the command line.
yea, he ended with a c i think not a c++?
get out i don't think this is valid.
won't it tell you that the operator '+' is not applicable to int and str?
is that not how python works?
i thought most modern languages used + for string construction for string concatenation, which is an operation taking strings as operands.
if you want to concatenate the _string representation of a number_ to a string, you have to first get the string representation of said number, i.e.
`str(num3)`.
for a language that does everything for you, python does very little for you.
it's just doing its best not to do _too much_ for you.
otherwise it would no longer be strongly typed and you would get a mess like javascript.
i mean, c# handles it just fine while being strictly typed aswell.
so does java i've been told java is hard to understand whereas python is dirt easy of course, python isn't *meant* to format strings by concatenation.
they have plenty of better ways of formatting strings.
so because concatenation usually isn't used for this purpose, they decided to make it more strict on the operand types edit: particularly with int and str there's a real clash, since they both use the "+" operand in a different way.
this isn't a problem in php because they use `.` for concatenation.
and because it's explicit it's able to safely coerce types.
for example 1 + "1" in php is 2, not 11. there's just as much reason to say that the "+" operand should behave this way as it does for string concatenation.
in java i guess someone said it's ridiculous to automatically parse a string to a number, so they had no problem just saying: "okay, + is always concatenation if there's a string involved" the only difference is the `+` operator lacks type coercion, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, and it certainly doesn't mean python "does very little for you".
you *could* use explicit type conversion along with string concatenation (ex.
`"value = " + str(val)`), but it's not very pythonic.
you should generally prefer one of the other methods of string formatting python provides, which is *more* than most other languages: * `"value = %d" % val` — old style string formatting * `"value = {}".format(val)` — new style string formatting * `f"value = {val}"` — formatted string literals (f-strings) introduced in 3.6 i would also like to note that having type coercion does not make a language "modern".
rust—which i consider to be a very modern language—almost entirely lacks type coercion in any context.
it does have three different formatting things though, to use instead of `+`.
julia uses \*, because + is commutative.

this could actually be a oneliner in python (3): ``` print(max(int(input()) for _ in range(3))) ``` edit: you're right, i needed a cast i love python.
i said that here a few days ago, and some user said 'i remember my first programming class, too'.
what a dick.
and that doesn't even make sense.
python is used for all sorts of projects across all industries.
the music player i've been using since 2008, quod libet, is written in python.
great piece of software, imo.
python applications feel less out of place on linux than in other oses because of how deeply integrated in the stack it is.
i use it for high level research and for some data analysis (because of matlabs popularity more is dine matlab, but i generate and organise data through python).
gnu radio (which also uses some c++) uses so much python and is so helpful.
i've also used it with fpga verification honestly i would have said that too.
it's my third year in college, and only the programming 101 class used python.
it's still the go-to language for any personal projects of mine.
&gt;honestly i would have said that too.
it's my third year in college, sounds about right.... 12 years of professional experience here.
yeah i mean, out of all the available modules in python, such as keras or scipy, i'm sure none have any professional use right?
/s yes, op must have thought like me was my intention from the start, and reading it now holy hell i just was begging for downvotes weren't i. guess i gotta improve on my writing, as always.
&gt; ```print(max([int(input()) for _ in range(3)]))``` ftfy print(max(int(input()) for _ in range(3))) ftfy gotta save those extra few bytes by making it a generator.
regular brain: max(int(input()) for _ in range(3)) brain penetrated by beams of light: max(map(lambda x: int(input()), 'k'*3)) galactic omnipotent illuminated entity brain: max(eval('('+'int(input()),'*3 + ')')) eval(f'max({"int(input()),"*3})') 3.6, just lovin' it.
universe big-bang brain `max(map(int,map(input, '123')))` no idea why you're being downvoted - the cast *is necessary*, otherwise the output would be sorted lexically.
he’s doing gcse he knows it but in a gcse mock it’s understandable that he didn’t want to use that if he’s not confident in his ability to write it like that wait, python max function even works on strings?
`int(input())` converts each string to an `int`.
the rest is basically just list comprehension, but with a generator, and the `max` function takes an iterable (e.g.
a generator) as an input.
in addition to /u/aquawolfguy's answer (it's converted to ints), i want to point out that yes, `max` works on strings.
in fact, `max` works on any types that are orderable.
the following is correct (though useless) code in python 3.6: class demo: def __lt__(self, other): return true max(demo(), demo()) edit: note that `max` requires that everything you pass in be orderable compared to everything else.
in other words, you can run `max(demo(), none)` since the demo object can be compared to `none`, but `max(none, none)` will break with `typeerror: '&gt;' not supported between instances of 'nonetype' and 'nonetype'` &gt; edit: you're right, i needed a cast you could have used python 2, your code would have been correct.
your fate would have been worse than just a correction, though.
haha yeah, i can't understand that they thought it would be a good idea to eval() input in python 2. could be a oneliner in c too.
&gt;####include "stdlib.h" int main() {.... #include need to be on a separate line int scanf(char *format, ...); int printf(char *format, ...); int main() {.... i love codegolf great code, but you don't need num1 and num2.
that'll save a couple bytes if it’s python, he forgot to change num3 to a string if this were javascript it'd be nbd!
it's pseudocode.
duh.
but whose pseudo code looks like actual code didn't this guy learn to never trust user input?
ah but he was hard of hearing that day.
he heard: &gt; ever trust user input it's touching, really.
the faith, that is.
he's too polite to distrust user input.
everyone should be pissed off that he started with num1 instead of num0... it's a label not an array index.
and using numbers in your variable names is stupid no matter how you number them.
yeah.
shoulda been num_i, num_ii, and num_iii.
well, yes.
the whole thing was just a joke... assumes the problem is not between the keyboard and chair.
fail!
1 delta 10 tango god, python exam questions......the dark days.
i think that's an ocr or aqa exam as well, which is even more triggering yeap aqa paper 2 at its finest i was bored and decided to do this for real in a language called pyth h_s edit: explanation h_s print (implied) h first element of _ reversed s sorted evaluated input (implied) everyone correcting his type assumption.
is no one going to credit his manners?
"thank you for using this program~~me~~".
what a gentleman!
poor wording in the question: "write an algorithm to input 3 numbers..." wait, the algorithm needs to input numbers or receive 3 numbers?
boy, i hope somebody got fired for that blunder.
i can guarantee nobody got fired for that.
[i'll field this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa6fbof3x8m) it’s not really a typo would just have been more clear if it had implied that the user inputs three numbers and not the program how polite isn't he the dude whose apps want to users to input blockchain hashes?
that user experience tho his mistake was assuming that the user is always going to input valid data.
at least he used int() when python passes as pseudo code i don't get why people are still given paper exams in computer science courses.
seems ridiculous.
it’s all the theory while it’s great to know the coding and languages ect, having a understanding of the workings and logic gates ect are fairly fundamental it also encourages algorithmic thinking which is a major part of the work my favourite bit is the indecision at the end about whether to use the american *program* or british *programme*.
hahaha our teachers an american guy the guy who wrote it is british though that being said he looks like gollem :p he is correct , that's for sure!
lol can't tell if python or pseudocode.
we had this question on my computer architectures exam.
asking for largest of three arguments in a c program.
written by hand.
with no computers allowed.
next question?
translate your c program to assembly.
i had so many cramps in my hand, when we were done with that exam.
i'm sorry.... you had to write your c program *by hand* and then write the same code in assembly *by hand* again...???
that's fucking evil!
even worse, this was only question 1 and 2 on a long written exam.
the reason we weren't allowed our laptops was that they were too noisy.
this was back in 2007, where laptops might indeed have been more noisy than now, however, in the same hall some physicists had a written exam as well and they were allowed their computers.
it's not evil, it's just stupid.
you're right, that is worse!
it's bad enough when someone's just being evil or cruel, but when they're just a cretin you think that if you just explain it to them properly, enough times, then eventually they'll get it and in the end you just die trying in complete and utter futility!
pretty ingenious actually.
there is not written only the biggest number ... best solution is to print all of them - in case user is evil just more proof psuedo code is python if you wanna see the guy that did it google kid falls of scooter into pool https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4ofjpnwk0r4 fyi he asked me to i wonder how many points you'd get for this answer... on the left hand side is a 2 in red pen and on the bottom right is a 4 in brackets so i'm assuming he got 2 out if 4. you are correct.
he did.
2 apparently.

*image transcription: text messages* --- **person a**: i'm reviewing my students evaluations from their cis and i just saw the term "scrotal sling"... bet you don't get to see that in your line of work!
😜 **person b**: maybe not me, but some poor programmer somewhere had to write a scrotal sling purchase web app.
he wrote the word scrotal so many times that the word started to look like a meaningless set of letters and he had to look up the word to make sure he was spelling it correctly.
when he tries to type scroll, he sometimes accidently types scrotal now.
his scrotal sling nightmares led him to give up his profession altogether.
now he makes furniture in boise, idaho.

ok, so writing a word out so many times that you have to look it up is a thing.
thankfully it's not just me that becomes variable illiterate.
there's a real term for it too.
something about those networks get so heavily taxed that they begin to fail temporarily.
like you know how repeatedly say a word over and over makes the word sounds funny.
i first experienced it my freshman year of college writing a stimulated vending machine that dispensed fruit.
the word fruit lost all meaning and i had to keep looking it up because there was no way this jumble of letters represented any known concept.
i was writing a queue manager recently.
queue is such a weird word anyway, but it just got so much worse from there... que...ok, keep going.
queue...is that right?
queueue...ok, that looks wrong... must have been queue.
wait is it qeueu?
omg, what am i doing with my life?!?!
queue, enqueue, dequeue, requeue, queueueueueueueue.
kill me.
refactored the entitled persistence model for a legacy application doing a database swap.
privilege was spelled "priviledge."
this was a million-line application.
global find and replace broke everything, and i didn't feel like doing it manually.
i still triple check every time i have to spell the word.
update 1: i recalculated the timing, and it's actually probably just 37-38 hours.
on an unrelated note, i haven't done any work today.
update 2: the solution i posted doesn't work.
the number of iterations for the inner loop has to be equal to 12n+10 for some positive integer n. so 6118 would work, or 6130.
9994 is the largest 4 digit number you could use in the inner loop to solve the puzzle.
that would take 61-62 hours.
good work.
i have not either.
you are crazy!
:o i find it really annoying that they count "code written" instead of "code executed" to determine the length.
they should use both.
every program has a break point where cpu-time becomes more valuable than developer time.
this is for kids, you know that, right?
even a kid understands that sending the bunny on a 40 hours journey just to save themself 1 symbol is a bad plan.
eh, we can have 2400 bunnies do it in a minute.
bunnies are cheap, bunny-programmers are payed by symbols and expensive.
you have a lot to learn on how to operate a bunny farm.
right, but that's not what we are talking about.
the goal has to be simple for the players that want to go the extra mile.
it does not need to be a perfect measure for how good the code is.
hey, they're just lucky we're not making them give the bunny instructions in assembly.
spoiled .. what do we call kids born in the 2010's ... teenials?
&gt; every program has a break point where cpu-time becomes more valuable than developer time.
and that can be surprisingly short.
e.g.
if a microsoft programmer shaves 5 seconds off a typical windows boot time, that could save somewhere in the region of 30 _years_ of users' time per day.
of course, that may not translate directly into more sales of windows right away, so a business case might be more difficult to justify... explain how it works?
it basically goes around in a "circle," but every once in a a while, the circle shifts over.
so it gets all of the carrots in the middle first, then moves to the outside, and gradually moves around the outside.
you can try it with 10 iterations for the inner loop.
it only takes about 4 minutes that way.
exactly 6124 times?
you can't make it fewer?
how did you even work that out?
it can be as few as 10.
~~i know for sure that for any number *n* of iterations on the first loop that produces a valid solution, (n*2)+2 is also valid.~~ (edit: it's actually just 12n+10, for some positive integer n).
6124 was mostly just a large number i picked that ~~i knew worked~~ (edit: it doesn't work).
strictly speaking, there are arbitrarily large numbers of iterations that are valid solutions also, but the game only displays 4 digits.
(edit: this last part is still true).

dammit.
what game is this ?
it's the google doodle and the shortest solution for the last level is just 4 blocks length.
https://imgur.com/dqor8k6 i had the same solution, but i just kinda eyeballed it and guessed.
is this a provably correct solution?
my valid shortest solution had one more instruction in it you can do it with 10 iterations for the inner loop, and it only takes about 4 minutes.
i've done it with 10, 22, 46, 94, and 190. i think this one i posted is actually incorrect, but i'm not sure where my math went off.
ah, i see.
that's impressive.
kudos the three last puzzles can be done in fewer instructions than the game claims.
https://youtu.be/chylgmlgvbq whats the name of the game?
it's the google doodle for december 4, 2017.
[here's a link](https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-50-years-of-kids-coding).
it's yesterdays google doodle 40 hours?
i bet you felt a sense of pride and accomplishment when it finished.
omg i thought it had something to do with the shortest path and number of movements or something.
i've lost a lot of my time... wow, i had no idea that you could adjust the number of cycles and just accepted that they are all repeated 4 times.
imagine i had no idea that you could put a cycle inside another.
or that you could do more than 1 instruction per cycle.
(was using it on my cellphone) what's this called?

yeah, i think the solution is pretty clean how did you do it?
if you are the real steve jobs, hire me and i'll tell you ;) (hint: you can't fall off the cliffs, i used that) yes, i know, that's how mine works.
i just did it in 3 blocks, actually.
wow, now thats great, because i actually confused this one with the next level i just did this with 5, but i will try figure out how you did it :d i was just kidding.
i thought you were messing with people, because this level isn't possible with 4 blocks.
yep, i realised that too now it's impossible with 4

it even tells you how to exit on the screen.
[it even telly you when you press `ctrl`+`c`](https://i.imgur.com/ftzebqm.png) what's the difference between `q!` and `qa!`?
i assume `qa` makes the command apply to all open documents and not just the currently shown ah, that makes sense.
i never really use vim.
i always use sublime on my own machine (and nano for quick terminal stuff) and emacs or nano on my raspberry pi (over ssh).
q is `quit`, w is `write`, a is `all` and !
is `force on error`.
so `:wqa!` saves all files and quits, trying to write readonly files anyway.
there are also some weirder ones like , confirm which makes the following command ask for confirmation on error and cq which quits with an error code if vim was started by a git merge or something.
thanks!
q is what the customer gives you, while qa is something often ignored by companies.
/s i feel like people are so used to the vim welcome screen that they're completely oblivious to what is on it.
one does not simply \vim to be fair, i've been trying out emacs lately and it's hard to quit that too lol.
try evil mode.
it's pretty awesome &amp; extensible, and probably more productive than emacs default keys best bet is just to throw your computer out and get a new one how else would you exit vim?
