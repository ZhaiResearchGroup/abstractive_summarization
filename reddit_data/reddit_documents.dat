 He's saying he's resigning, not because he's guilty, but because he can't be an effective senator for the people of Minnesota while also dealing with the ethics investigation.   [~~livestream link~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n84ixMf2Vto)  E: ~~new livestream link~~  [video of his resignation speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYynQ9SKZw8) It doesn't matter anymore. By resigning he is now guilty. The only thing that will save him is some miraculous revelation that all his accusers were hired by project veritas, and the media does an about face and issues apologies which they will never do.    Nope, the new innocent is to categorically deny, call the acussers liars, and ride out the storm.  Not even just for government but for everything. An accusation is the new guilty and denial and pr is the new innocent. Facts seemingly don't matter. Think of all the people in Hollywood caught up in metoo. The ones that dug in their heels and denied are doing much better than others.  This is like a recent episode of Orville (although its season 1 so all are recent). They don't get lawyers when arrested, they get PR reps. Doesn't matter your guilt or innocence, matters how you sell yourself on your PR tour.  I watched that episode recently. They would upvote and downvote people from their phones.  What a silly concept! Can we take a moment to talk about how great the Orville is?  It’s like satire and homage rolled into one tasty ball. This isn't new. Always been that way. He did say he "crossed a line" so he's admitting to something. He considers the picture from the original accusation, that showed mimed groping, to have been crossing a line, as it was in terrible taste.  Thank you for being the one person to explicitly call it what it was, miming. It infuriates me how many people call that a photo of groping. You can clearly see the shadow of his hands and fingers on her body which basically proves there was no contact. Why can’t people comprehend this?  Yes it was inappropriate and in bad taste but it is not even comparable to preying on 14 yr old girls. Just call it "sexual misconduct" so you can throw it all in the same sack. I've even heard it referred to as sexual assault, actually (probably from the right to further disparage him.) Seems like a pretty big disservice to people who are actually assaulted. It was a bad joke, but that's about it. ~~She was also conducting herself inappropriately around that time~~   She was also engaging in sexually charged behavior, which could easily lead to an atmosphere where he thought this sexual joke would be okay.  I haven't really liked Franken since his state went to Sanders and he still insisted he'd use his superdelegate for Clinton.. but this particular instance is overblown.  Edit : I am not victim shaming any one, nor did I say it excused his behavior. Everything has context however. Here is the woman he pretended to grope in the picture. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJidGI-NMd0  Again, this doesn't excuse his behavior. But there is context to everything.  Edit #2 : Here she is on the same tour, pretending to hump Robin Williams and smack his ass. https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;v=GKERuf_hwLw  Also, she's contributed to Sean Hannity's show.. so take that for what you will. Did you watch Full Frontal yesterday? Sam Bee has gone off the deep end. She literally called any man that has misbehaved around women a sexual predator.  ANY misbehavior.  Equating just being an asshole to a woman to rape.    I used to respect her. That went away.  She's also against busing in lower income kids to her children's privilege school. She's totally for busing in those kids to your children's school though.   http://www.slate.com/blogs/schooled/2016/06/17/the_upper_west_side_is_new_york_s_latest_school_integration_battleground.html fuckin NIMBY shitheads thinking they know what's best for everyone Not in my back yard they won't! Thanks for saving me the trip to urbandictionary Perhaps I'm not reading it right, but it seems like they are opposed to moving the school's location 16 blocks away and not busing in new minority students. Those are two completely different issues. That article quotes her husband not her. They don’t necessarily have the same stance. Now, not saying anything about her stance is pretty damning when her husband has stated such a strong opinion but I wouldn’t put words in her mouth. Did you link to the wrong article? That article is about moving an entire school that was originally opened to address overcrowding to another location, in order to address overcrowding.  Jason Jones, Samantha Bee's husband, is quoted only as saying that to pretend classism/racism is the only place that opposition to moving the school could come from is ridiculous.  The idea of whether Samantha Bee (or her husband for that matter) is for or against busing low income children to better schools doesn't come up. And really, practically none of the information necessary to make an informed decision about what's best here is provided in that article or its sources.  I had the same impression. At one point in time, Full Frontal was funny, cutting, insightful commentary. Last night was crazytown.   I get that we're at a flashpoint with this stuff and emotions are running high, but last night's episode absolutely went off the deep end. She had that montage of Hillary bashing that conflated sexist criticism with legitimate criticism, which seemed to be making the dangerous and stupid point that "any criticism against a woman is inherently sexist" which I guess means we can't criticize women now? Is that where she wants this to land?   It was disturbing.  She did that during the 2016 Primary too, Bernie Bros were no doubt obnoxious but Bernie was extremely careful to not endorse sexism. &gt; She was also conducting herself inappropriately around that time  Can you explain what this refers to, please? "I hover handed some boobs in a staged photo" - Franken “I molested underaged girls.” — Future Republican Senator   “I grabbed pussies by the dozen.” — Sitting Republican President with no intention of resigning   But at least with Franken’s departure  Democrats get to feel superior and, in politics,  that’s how you get legislation passed.   Edit: added but then deleted /s because not necessary  It has to be done, but the Democrats are Ned Stark-ing themselves.  Robb starking* Still too soon, RIP to the true kingindanorf  He should've honored the wedding arrangement. That was a massive fuck up on his part :/ His fatal flaw was sending Theon back to the Iron Islands. The cascade of his downfall stemmed from there. That was hard for him to forsee; he grew up with theon and never expected betrayal. I agree to be sure, but I don't think anyone would have been able to make a better decision given the situation Theon was an idiot though. Don't trust idiots to do important jobs. True, but I don't think Rob was actually expecting Theon to deliver, and he was a nuisance on the field. He also never even considered that he would switch sides. Mistakes all around, certainly.  Unfortunately a lack of experience is what led to the mistake. He didn't understand Iron Islanders can't be given a kingdom. Logically from a northern perspective it's an amazing deal for then to join Robb but Robb never fought them or alongside them(Theon doesn't really count). No, if he lived that would have been a problem, but not a fatal flaw.   What really did Robb Stark in was executing the lord of half his military forces and then taking a piss on the head of the Lord who commanded most of his Allied forces.   His mother warned him he couldn't do that to Walder Frey, but honor(book) dictated it from his point of view.   Theon's transgressions, horrible as they may be, were of far less importance than driving your largest ally into the arms of your enemies and causing half your standing army to desert overnight.  It wasn't even his own honor,  (at least in the books). He slept with Jane and felt it would be incredibly dishonorable to her if he didn't follow that act with a marriage proposal. Jane was a Westerling, and putting her before his own kin was indeed a fatal flaw, if not treasonous. Indeed. The only thing that marriage brought into play was 50 swords and a few knights. Geopolitically speaking, it was suicidal. Even *if* he hadn't already made promises to the Freys and also wasn't in need of every sworn sword he could get, marrying such an unimportant noblewoman would've been stupid in the long run.  Ned Stark married a daughter of House Tully, that was a politically savvy marriage. If Robb didn't marry a Frey, he'd need to marry either the daughter of a vassal lord or of a major non-rival lord (i.e. not a Lannister or one of their sworn banner lords). He should have rammed the mud gate This sounds horrifyingly euphemistic. Wait until you hear about the Red Wedding Give me ten men and I'll impregnate the bitch How does this make any sense?    They're Ned Stark-ing themselves. Refusing to forsake their honor even if it means their downfall.    Robb Stark got stabbed in the back.  Robb Stark beheaded his most loyal bannerman (and distant cousin, remember what the gods think of kinslaying) for murdering a pair of Lanniater POWs in retaliation for Jaime killing his son in battle, and Catelyn subsequently agreeing to a hostage exchange (Jaime for her daughters).  Morally and ethically, Robb made the right decision. Practically, however, it was suicide.  He compounded this by knocking up some minor noble wench and marrying her, breaking his marriage contract with Walder Frey. He starts on a moral and ethical high, to end on a moral and ethical low. I wouldn't really say Robb Stark got stabbed in the back. He knowingly entered a political alliance, and then he betrayed that alliance almost immediately. For all his battlefield wit he sure didn't honor the agreements he made very well. Still not the same as inviting you to a wedding feast with the insipid and deliberate pre-meditation of you and your family's murder. Fuck the Freys. Nothing will get better in this country until we end the competition for blaming which side is held to a lower standard and start holding our own parties to higher standards.  I feel like this is what we are saying but the other party isn't even playing the same game at this point. Democrats: "Ha Ha! Now they will have to start taking responsibility for their actions!"  Republicans: "One down." This really is more about internal politics and 2020 strategy than anything else.  The sudden push for the Democrats to turn against Al Franken, which all happened in the last 48 hours leading up to this, was largely driven Kamala Harris an Kirsten Gillibrand. Gillibrand's public call for Franken to resign yesterday which was immediately followed by over 20 people, including Harris who called for it on CNN, had obviously been very well coordinated and planned.  Franken was looking at running for president in 2020 and so are Harris and Gillibrand. He is a big star for the Democrats and has much more name recognition, so they saw this as an opportunity to take him out now while he was hurt by this, so that they don't have to take him on in the 2019 DNC primaries.  It was the shot that lead to this moment today. After that a story was "leaked" to the press that Franken was going to resign tomorrow, and by the time Franken had come out and said it wasn't true a few hours later it had already been reported everywhere and it just gained it's own momentum. In what way?  Minnesota has voted for the democratic presidential candidate 7 times in a row.  The seat is safe.  It's still a democratic vote.  Edit: OK, I get it.  No seat is safe, MN is full of Conservatives and Santa isn't real.  I'll go back to being miserably aware of how shitty everything is. Dems will probably win, but [it's not as blue as you think.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-will-likely-hold-frankens-seat-but-minnesotas-not-as-blue-as-it-seems/) It’s never as blue as it seems, red takes over anywhere that’s not a major city. Isn't that true like for the entire country? Not even the US. Look at the election maps in Turkey for the last election. It is a global thing that rural people tend to vote with very different points of view than urban people. Nothing new under the sun.  [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_general_election,_June_2015#/media/File:Turkish_general_election_2015,_provinces_and_districts.png) is a recent election map for Turkey. The yellow portion is the AKP, which is their conservative party. Seem [familiar](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2016/countymappurple1024.png)? (red is conservative in US)  Posting this because a lot of people I talk to and see on reddit feel that this is unique to their country, when it's a worldwide trend. I have traveled a LOT. And the way people see the world in rural Louisana is not far from people I have spoken with in rural areas of China. Seems we are so different, until you realize we aren't. Part of the fun of traveling! It's not even limited to humans.  I'll have to paraphrase as I can't dig up a link for the study I read years ago, but essentially a similar pattern of conservative and liberal behavioural differences also exists in rural/urban rats.    It makes perfect sense as evolution hasn't made us completely unique as a species.  If you live in a rural area you have a lot more personal freedom from the interference of other people and much less reliance or need for government. More government policies (liberal) will almost always negatively impact you.  In urban areas personal freedoms overlap and individuals have much less control over their own environments, so they seek to regulate their environment via government.   That's the best explanation I've heard for the difference of thought between the two areas. Pretty much. Franken needed a recount to get elected the first time, and won by 312 votes. Not safe by any means. Franken was also seen as a joke candidate [Minnesota has a history of electing joke candidates](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Jesse_Ventura). Yeah, 2 cast members of Predator became governors and Home Alone 2 is in the White House People keep spamming this fully ignoring how he was a comedian when he first ran and that he was re-elected by a sizable majority. Clinton barely won it this year though. Only won by 40,000 people  yeah. that was because it was Clinton.... &gt; yeah. that was because it was Clinton....  Spot on.  I live in MN, and I voted for Clinton, but I -- like many others -- *really* wanted Sanders. What are the odds Ellison wins a statewide? He would have decent odds. It would really depend on who ran against him but he is very popular in his district and could probably get a good amount of the vote in the cities. But minnesota is weird once you get outside the twin cities and he would have to find a way to get votes in the areas that elected Jason Lewis and Michelle Bachmans old district.  Because in MN, people said "She'll win the state anyway, and I don't like her enough to go vote." Do you remember the lengths Franken had to go to just to win the senate election he legitimately won? "Dog gon-it people like me"?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_election_in_Minnesota,_2008  &gt;Al Franken took his oath of office on July 7, 2009, more than half a year after the beginning of his term on January 3, 2009. Clinton won Minnesota by only 45,000 votes. In 2012, Obama won it by over 200,000. In 2008, he won it by almost 300,000.  As we saw in the last election, Minnesota, like the Midwest as a whole, is becoming more purple than blue. Who knows what the state will look like in ~~2020~~ 2018 when his seat is up for the special election, especially considering Republicans typically outperform in off-years.  Edit: Special election is in 2018, not 2020. Na. Clinton was just a horrible candidate.   Obama's first win was a historic event, so that 300k was probably a bit inflated.   Assuming the dems don't chose another awful candidate in 2020, numbers should be back up around the Obama 2012 numbers.  All the Dem senators said he should resign within hours of each other. It's blatantly obvious what's happening here. Franken is the sacrificial lamb, and with him and Conyers gone now, they will be free to take the moral high ground on Roy Moore. They can now bash Trump and the GOP over the head with Moore 24/7.   And then the Republicans will be like, "Wow, the Democrats have such higher morals.  We should vote for them."  /s No, but suburban moderate Republican voters (notably women) who already despise Trump may now have even more reason to turn their backs on the GOP. And they might at least not vote. I know such suburban Republican women voters.  I work with them.  They eat up everything Fox News says.  The Roy Moore and Trump accusations are left wing conspiracy theories, and only democrats have actually admitted to it, they say.   Democrats always chase these "moderate" voters and don't get them while simultaneously alienating their base. Republicans have twice the rhetoric with half the values.  Democrats have twice the values and half the rhetoric.  If every action we take is built on the assumption that people will simply sit still and listen to what's being said, we're going to come up empty-handed every time. People *don't* sit still. We're addicts, gossips, and pragmatic procrastinators. There's a huge swath of voters who feed off of punchy headlines and bandwagon parades, yet Democrats too often lead with safe bets.  Democrats are like a high school reading list that only features classical British literature. You can't win over teens with *A Tale of Two Cities* while your Republican counterparts are delivering *A Game of Thrones*. You're forgetting about abortion. They'll always vote R, because Jesus.  Edit: ok look, I want to edit this comment to address pro-life people, because it's apparently mildly visible.  I assume we're all reasonable people capable of having a reasonable discussion. I apologize for how dismissive my original comment was to your pro-life beliefs, but (as you'll see below) I think there are much more powerful, logical, goal-oriented reasons for being pro-choice (and remember, we're *all* anti-abortion – nobody likes abortions). At times, it does feel as though pro-life people cling to a belief and close their ears to anything else, which leaves a lot of people feeling the sentiment I originally expressed in a shitty one-liner.   However, I do think that we all at least *want* information presented to us to challenge our beliefs and allow us to grow as people. So, if you're pro-life, I'd like to give you three thought experiments below with questions included that I'd like you to answer in response to this comment if you have the time and inclination:  **1)** 81% of the country thinks that abortion should be legal in at least *some* cases (source: [Pew Research](http://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion/)). For example, in situations where the mother's life is in jeopardy, in cases of forced incest, in cases of rape, and other medical or moral reasons. That's **81%** of Americans. Restricting abortion at the federal level in *any way* allows states like Texas to pass wildly restrictive laws that limit abortion centers' ability to operate and serve people in these demographics. Arduous state regulations are why there are only [*sixteen* abortion clinics in Texas](https://fundtexaschoice.org/resources/texas-abortion-clinic-map/) vs. [218 in New York](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/state-facts-about-abortion-new-york).  Breaking it down:  - Texas has 28M people, for a rate of 1 clinic per every 1.75 *million* people.   - NY has 19.75M people, for a rate of 1 clinic per every 90,000 people.  - TX has 268,000 square miles of land, for a rate of 1 clinic every 16,750 square miles.  - NY has 54,500 square miles of land, for a rate of 1 clinic every 250 square miles.  Now, if you're part of the 81% of Americans who believe that in *some – any – cases,* an abortion should be legal, you should understand why voting for Republicans works against that goal. Any restrictions – any – at the federal level allow states like Texas to logistically prevent women in danger from receiving a potentially life-saving abortion. It is truly impossible for some women in certain states like Texas to receive an abortion in *any* scenario because of state laws presenting wildly arduous regulations on the industry, and only left-wing candidates will actually see to it that women in need are able to get abortions when they've reached the point of no other option.  If you're in the 81%, which party do you think will allow life-saving abortions to be administered as needed to women in jeopardy?  If you're not in 81% of Americans who believe this, then would you respect the wishes of 4/5 voters and vote for the better policies to pursue to achieve these goals?  **2)** Financial pressure of raising a child is the #1 reason people decide to have an abortion. There is one group of politicians – progressives – that push for tuition-free college, mandatory maternity leave, affordable child daycare, and broader healthcare coverage provided by a government option.   If these policies would all reduce the financial burden of having a child, what do you think would happen to the abortion rate?  Additionally, access to contraception and robust sexual education has been proven to reduce abortion rates ([down 42% in Colorado since free IUDs were offered to women](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/06/science/colorados-push-against-teenage-pregnancies-is-a-startling-success.html)).  If the goal is fewer abortions, which party would you vote for to improve access to contraception?  **3)** A man is dying and needs a heart transplant to live. He has 24 hours left before he passes, but if he receives a new heart, there is a 99% chance he'll live.  In the next room in the hospital, there is a woman with a healthy heart that matches his needs, and she will 100% die due to injuries sustained in an auto accident.  However, that woman is not an organ donor.  We, as a society, have decided that *her right to her own body* is so sacred, that we will *let that man die* in the next room if she doesn't consent to having her chest opened up and her heart harvested to save another life. We, as a society, actively and daily choose to let countless people die, leaving behind entire families, because we so value someone's bodily autonomy.  Would you be in favor of forced organ donations in cases like the above in order to save a fully-formed life?  If not, do you think that is consistent with your view on abortion, where you want to take away someone's bodily autonomy to save a non-fully-formed life?  Very curious as to how pro-life people feel on all of these questions. Thanks for reading. There's no such thing as the mythical middle-class suburban moderate Democrats have spent the last decade chasing.  Oh, sure, the middle-class white Republicans typically aren't as backwards on social issues as working-class Republicans, but the things Dems never seem to grasp is that's because they **don't really care.** They **don't really care** about racism. They **don't really care** about homophobia. They want tax breaks for their small businesses. They want regulations they view as troublesome to go away. They may join with the Dems in condemning far-right-wingers for their racism and sexism and so on, but when the time comes, they'll still vote for them, because they **don't really care.**  Edit: The white middle-class voted for Trump in the same numbers they did for previous Republicans, and formed the core of his support. They just voted for him _despite_ his racism and sexism, not because of it. Well said. And this myth that conservative women "despise trump" is so toxically wrong it makes my blood boil. White women (which encompasses nearly all of conservative women) cast more votes for trump than for Clinton. And if you think anything that's happened in the last year has changed that you're part of the reason progressivism constantly fails to make an impact at the poles. It's a brilliant plan! Surely the people that voted for the pussy grabbing, compulsive lying, racist dog-whistling, handicap mocking, conman will appreciate the moral superiority of the Democrats and shift allegiances. Republicans still whatabout Anthony Weiner even though he resigned, I GUARANTEE they will whatabout Al Franken for years. They couldn't give a fuck that he resigned.  They'll clutch onto this Franken scandal with white knuckles. How about NOT electing moore to the senate?  people on the right or the center wont care. &gt; They can now bash Trump and the GOP over the head with Moore 24/7.  As they should........sexual harassment and sexual assault aren't supposed to be partisan issues, yet here we are. the moral high ground? does that matter to modern republicans? they've settled into nice lives in the moral gutter and couldn't care less how high up the democrats get. As much as the Democrats are going to hurt over this one (Love him or hate him, Franken is a big character in Washington) the Democrats would have never maintained their legitimacy in criticizing the Republican sexual assaults if they gave Al Franken a pass.   He's a loss for their party but he granted them some legitimacy in this discussion.  I seriously think this is the biggest reason that they pushed for the resignation so quickly, as opposed to waiting for the investigation. I worry if this will have the effect they intended. It now appears only Republicans are innocent until proven guilty.  Franken has denied most accounts or said they're not as he remembers, but still resigned. Resignation is seen by many a sign of guilt. Whether or not he is or isn't. They will say, "See, now that Roy Moore is a senator he can't be ACTUALLY guilty as he would have stepped down if the claims were legitimate." ugh It is an extension of prosperity gospel. "these men are rich because they're good Christians," "Franken resigned so he must be guilty," "Trump and Moore won their elections and are completely vindicated because they won. they must be innocent because they won and are standing firm and tall" You are correct, the worst kind of correct.  Let’s see what happens with Roy Moore. I’m sure he’ll do the honorable thing and drop out.  /s For many pedophiles, it’s impossible to make ends meet. These sex criminals are often shunned both socially and professionally, making it extremely difficult for them to find any sort of gainful employment. But now a group called the GOP is trying to change all that: This amazing organization helps disgraced pedophiles rebuild their lives by getting them elected to political office.  If that doesn’t lift your spirits, we don’t know what will.  While most Americans are openly disgusted by pedophiles, the bighearted people over at the GOP seek to help them find decent, well-paying jobs where they can shape national policy. You only need to look at the amazing work the GOP is doing with pedophile Roy Moore in the special U.S. Senate election in Alabama to know that this organization is looking out for the people society tries to put in the margins.  [stolen from ClickHole] Democrats and liberals need to realize, they aren't playing the same game as the republican party.  The American people need to realize that there's actually really no guardian diety protecting the United States, preventing it from sliding into just being another shithole fallen empire run by idiots into eventual global impotence.  Because the rest of the world, especially Russia, already knows this. Yeah I don't think so. I think it's going to be that awesome pattern of Democrats taking the high ground and Republicans taking advantage of it.   1. They try to reach across the aisle and compromise and aren't able to get much done when they have a majority. Republicans steamroll them when they get into power.   1. They create (relatively) fair voting districts and allow republicans to get into power. Republican state officials create the most egregiously gerrymandered districts in history so they can cling to power despite widespread negative approval ratings.   2. They delay their right to nominate and confirm a LIFETIME SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, and effectively give it to the Republicans (this one I'll never forgive them for. As soon as repubs said they'd refuse to see any nominees they should have grown a pair and just pushed him through), and now:  4. Democrats encourage their own sexually-harassing senator to step down, Republicans simultaneously criticize him while openly supporting a statutory rapist / child abuser, who will become the next senator of Alabama.  Then of course there's the massively higher amount of money republicans take from corporate interests, and then just coincidentally vote in their favor on even nonpartisan issues like Net Neutrality.  I'm not saying Franken shouldn't have stepped down. It's just hard when your opposing party's elected officials literally have no values.  &gt;They delay their right to nominate and confirm a LIFETIME SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, and effectively give it to the Republicans (this one I'll never forgive them for. As soon as repubs said they'd refuse to see any nominees they should have grown a pair and just pushed him through)  I don't have a clue what you're talking about. How were they supposed to push him through? Republicans controlled the Senate. The President's party does not have a right to confirm a SCOTUS appointment, the Senate does. That was written by someone who literally has no idea how the senate works. The only way Garland could have gotten on to the SC is if Obama had made a recess appointment, which would have been very out of the realm of norms (though now, would not look that insane). Nothing the people in Congress could have done though. I thought I heard that they kept like 3 Republican senators around at basically all times to do a roll call even over "breaks" so that they could contest a recess appointment (which would have been temporary anyway). The far out there argument I saw was that the justice is appointed with the "advice and consent of the senate" and some were arguing a refusal to advise meant consent was unnecessary and therefore Obama could simply appoint Garland with out a hearing at all. I think the real reason is that even if there was an investigation and it found that accusers stories were embellished or whatever the scandal alone would hurt Franken's chance for re-election. Look at Hillary's approval ratings before Benghazi/emails and you can see that an investigation alone is enough to erode people's trust of a politician over time. Franken's seat will likely be given to a democrat and the democrats still have a good chance to retake the seat when Franken's replacement is up for re-election. Of course, this is all ONLY true if the person being investigated is a Democrat; if they're a Republican the investigation is a witch hunt and fake news planted by the Dems to discredit a good Christian family man just trying to make our country great again. &gt; Of course, this is all ONLY true if the person being investigated is a Democrat; if they're a Republican the investigation is a witch hunt and fake news planted by the Dems to discredit a good Christian family man just trying to make our country great again.  Yep. The Christian Right is so horned up against the media that Moore actually got a 9 point BUMP with Evangelicals after the initial accusations came out. "Well if the liberal media is making up fake news against him, he must be a great guy!" Oh good, now whatever smear campaign (Swift Boat, Benghazi, etc) the Republicans come up with, we should just roll over and have that person give up.  Yeah, because what's good for political discourse in this country is for people to immediately be forced into resignation the moment they're accused of something.  Democrats have the moral high ground.  Republicans have the house, the senate, the POTUS, the supreme court.. It's politics. The moral high ground doesn't mean shit. If it did, Trump wouldn't have been elected in the first place.  This is what kills me though. Dems are acting as if they needed to do this in order to be credible in asking Republicans to do the same--but Republicans literally could not care less. Moral high ground or not, they're going to straight up ignore everything and do what they want. When, in the last decade, has it happened any other way?  All that's happened here is we've lost an important senator. We gain nothing. &gt; Moral high ground or not, they're going to straight up ignore everything and do what they want.  The republicans get away with this time and time again because their voters allow it. Remember when we were all outraged that a gay soldier was booed during a republican debate? Remember when we were appalled by Trump's Access Hollywood tape? Republicans didn't bat a fucking eye, they stood by their candidate and they will stand behind Moore.  &gt; they stood by their candidate and they will stand behind Moore.  Probably because they don't want Moore standing behind them. &gt; Remember when we were all outraged that a gay soldier was booed during a republican debate?   Remember this every time they shout about supporting the troops.  I prefer to think about trump shitting on POWs because McCain hurt his feelings. The pro military party shitting on the people who were tortured, not to mention that they don't give a fuck about helping veterans.  Its like their feelings on babies, once they're out of the army (womb, though that comparison is admittedly bad), they can literally go die as far as Republicans care.  &gt; We gain nothing.  And even worse, we've morally compromised ourselves by selling out actual **justice** for the court of public opinion.  &gt; We posed for the shot. He immediately put his hand on my waist, grabbing a handful of flesh. I froze. Then he squeezed. At least twice.  This was the accusation yesterday that broke the camels back, he posed for a photograph. No reasonable, rational person would consider that a serious allegation of sexual misconduct, period.  An issue for the left is the perception that they lack backbone and over react to things in order to be unoffensive. They proved it again yesterday.  Republicans are playing checkers while the Democrats hit themselves in the face with stick. Man, this gave me a good laugh. Thanks for that. Jesus. I'm a woman and I am 100% certain I've squeezed people (both male and female) while posing for a photo. I guess my political career is over. Also a woman. There are numerous photos of me grabbing other women's boobs when I was in college. There are also pics of guys doing it to me(in jest) I'm not a victim or a harraser. This is insanity.  It's fucking absurd. What's next? Will Sherrod Brown have to resign because he told a dirty joke? Will John Lewis have to resign because he bumped into somebody in an elevator? OMG he squeezed a grown persons waist for a couple seconds? Lock him up in Ultra-Max!   They stumbled a little bit when Pelosi called Conyers iconic, and he was allowed to simply retire after using taxpayer funds for his affairs.  I know there are settlements on both sides otherwise the Republicans in Congress would be making a bigger deal out of these sealed settlements.   I want them all opened so we don't get a tactical application of the truth for political gain.  What good is legitimacy when it doesn't matter a lick in terms of voter outcomes? Do you think Republican women or really anyone is going to switch their vote from Rep to Dem over this?   Moore is still leading his opponent in Alabama according to several polls! It doesn't make a lick of difference! Alabama is already a lost cause for Democrats. I think they are trying to reel in the midwest moderates they lost in the last election. This whole debacle is lose-lose for them though. They will only appear either hypocritical or weak compared to Republicans, no matter which way they choose to go down this road. They're trying to play prisoner's dilemma against immoral opponents, and it's just terrible game theory. God we suck at strategy. It’s friggin Alabama. The Democrats shouldn’t be depressed that they’re losing there. &gt; Democrats would have never maintained their legitimacy in criticizing the Republican sexual assaults  If only the reverse were true. I honestly have no fucking idea what to think of the Republican voter at this point. What do these people typically get outraged about on a routine basis?  - They get outraged about young girls having sex.  - They get outraged about people who don't adhere to Christian/moral values.   This guy fucked a teenage girl (who was underage and couldn't consent) and they are honestly debating whether they should reelect him or not.   I'm not a Christian. I know plenty of good Christians who would nail themselves to a cross to end some world suffering. Anybody who calls themselves a Christian and would willingly consider reelecting a child rapist is existing in a headspace I can't ever hope to rationalize.   No hate on the good Christians. Shame on the ones who overlook scum like Roy Moore.  The really stupid thing is that the only rationalization for a *lot* of these people is the fact that so many are single issue voters whose main concern is abortion. And it's demonstrably true that the abortion rate tends to be lower under democrat leadership than conservative leadership. Furthermore, the specific concern of late term abortion is bogus: Only 3 abortions occurred in Alabama after 20 weeks in 2016, and all three were due to medical necessity (i.e., to save the life of the mother). Doug Jones has stated that he does not oppose the current laws which basically say it's legal up to 20 weeks, and after that it requires 48 hours counseling and the practitioner to sanction the procedure based on special circumstances (rape, incest, medical necessity).  So yeah, anyone who's making the argument "child molester vs. murderer" is woefully off-base. Republican voters are a very interesting group, and I am not being sarcastic.  For reference, I grew up in the middle of coal country Utah, where both my parents and siblings still live, and I currently live in Massachusetts. Culturally you probably cannot find more opposite places in the US.  One difference I have noticed across my own family is that conservative voters play politics as if it is a win-lose scenario. They enjoy it when republicans win and enjoy it almost as much when liberals lose. Do they love Trump? Nope. But they do love sticking it to the liberals. In fact, they love pissing of liberals more than they love their own parties political ideas. I have never received on of those strange FWD: RE: FWD: FWD: that quickly summarizes an entire political argument in the caption of a political cartoon from my liberal friends but receive them all the time from my conservative friends. I am sure they exist in both groups but it the idea of quickly distilling and summarizing an argument in a situation that does not allow for conversation or discourse only exists among one of the sides of my family.  My dad works really hard, there is no doubt about it. He wants to work at his job, put in his time, go home play some board games and go to bed. My sister on the other hand loves long complex arguments and discussing the complexities of every point. My dad does not care about that and doesn't want to spend his time that way and that is how he follows politics. He wants everything to be easily summarized in a soundbyte and those are his political views.  Now look at some of the major ideas behind the political parties and where they stand on issues and try to sum it up in a single sentence that he would be willing to digest.  Gun control: R: They want to take your guns. Why: Constitution says we can have them. D: We want to discuss reasonable limitations to purchasing guns, such as background checks. Why: We believe this would reduce firearm deaths and mass shootings.  When you question the republican side you can just keep repeating those two lines again and again and the argument stays the same. The democrat line is much more complex and when pressed will have a bunch of "we aren't sure", "other countries do it" and after just a few sentences is becomes apparent that the argument on one side is more complex and as such, easier to poke holes in.  Many other political arguments follow the same logic. Abortions: God says no. While the opposite of a woman should have control of her body gets much more complex. What if the dad wants to keep it? What if he doesn't?  Taxes are the same thing. Everyone wants to pay less in taxes but one sides argument is more easily distilled.  It becomes apparent that there is a pattern between the politics. One side has much clearer, cleaner messages and those messages resonate with a certain type of person. It is much easier to digest a soundbyte. Take taxes. My dad wants less taxes and if the government makes less it will spend less. He likes that idea and it makes sense to him. Now, he is not going to engage enough in politics to understand that the republicans will tax less but spend the same and this just leads to greater national debt as there is larger deficit spending. He will not research it well enough since he does not want to devote more than 25 seconds a day to following politics.  Now my dad is not a stupid guy. He was a college professor and has a PhD in psychology. However, his complete lack of interest in politics lets him be taken advantage of since he refuses to follow politics. He doesn't know who Roy Moore is. He doesn't know who Al Franken is and he couldn't care less since he wants to focus on other things. If you can pin him down for 15 minutes and ask him specifically about his views on gay marriage, gun control (of which he owns 40), abortion, government spending and how it should be allocated, money in elections and so on he would realize his representatives have never voted the way he believes a single time in 60 years but he would be damned if he would ever vote democrat.  tl,dr: Simple messages resonate with certain people who do not care about politics. One side cares about politics more. Plus it is pretty fun to watch someone who really cares about something you think is stupid not get what they want.     I think this is true Its a team sport.  Their team is winning.  That's the republican world view. Republican's will never recognize Democratic legitimacy, so his resigning won't help with that.  The left that demanded his resignation abandon always abandon the party at the first opportunity anyway.  They'll forget about his resigning on election day and have a new reason why Democrats aren't good enough.  Bottom line, the only people who feels Franklin hurt legitimacy won't still won't care enough to vote D come election time.    Can’t wait for Reddit next Tuesday.  Most liberals I know or see on the internet are very pessimistic about the Alabama race and assume Roy Moore will win regardless of polls. Doug Jones and Moore are tied in the latest polls.  When credible evidence of pedophilia and abuse of authority come out about 1 candidates, and he _still_ has reasonable chance of winning, what reason is there to be optimistic?  It's important to remember that they're probably tied in the polls because people are too ashamed to admit they're voting for the pedophile. See: Trump polling. No, the polls last year were actually quite accurate. They put Hillary winning by roughly 2%, which she did. It was the analysis of the polls that were wrong, not the polling numbers. People weren't ashamed to admit they were voting for Trump.  Overall nationwide, maybe, but the individual state polls were flawed. Eh, it could go the either way too: too ashamed to admit they’re voting for someone pro abortion or a Democrat.  I don't think anybody in that position would vote for Doug Jones, they just won't vote.  I've seen most polls with Moore up by more than the margin of error though I have seen one poll with the reverse (Doug Jones up by 4-5 points).   Here's one that has Moore up by 7 points:  http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2017/12/roy_moore_vs_doug_jones_latest_1.html  Sadly, I believe it.  So... See you next Tuesday?   Watch your profamity. Every Democrat I know has already made peace with the fact that Roy Moore will win next week. Our opinion of Alabama is that low. I'm a Republican and refuse to vote for Roy Moore next week. Hopefully there are a few more like me. The real question is will you vote for Jones or abstain? This is the question I want answered. It's great and all that some people are ashamed of Roy Moore but unless they are going to vote against him, it's all just symbolic and doesn't really mean anything  It's honestly not going to be that interesting unless Roy loses. Most people are expecting him to win, even democrats.  Quote from his speech on the Senate Floor:  *"I of all people am aware that there is some irony in the fact I am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office and a man who repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the Senate with the full support of his party. But this decision is not about me. It’s about the people of Minnesota," Franken said.* Just wanted to provide you with the exact quote:  “I of all people am aware that there is some irony in the fact I am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape of his history of sexual assault is in the Oval Office, and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls has the full support of his party,” Franken said. Without the rest of that first sentence the quote sounded like a misdirection. He's done a fairly good job responding to the situation throughout, better perhaps than those who are openly pressuring him. Even though I suspect most of us will remember the blow-by-blow rather than the words exchanged, it's still a relief to see someone behaving like an adult for once and taking responsibility both for mistakes and obligations. Regardless of how his trials go, this quote made is resignation even more important than it already was. I was praying he'd put the spotlight right on Trump after seeing he had an announcement last night.  Limbaugh has already primed his audience (of 20 million devoted followers) to expect this.  He told them to expect a Franken resignation as part of a ploy to make Trump and Moore to look bad.  He also told them the ploy it wouldn't work (and then waved his hand like a jedi). Trump and Moore need absolutely no help looking bad. Limbaughs a fucking idiot. &gt; Limbaughs a fucking idiot.  I'm not sure if you know this or not, but Al Frankin (the same dude who's resigning right now) [actually wrote a book](https://www.amazon.com/Rush-Limbaugh-Big-Fat-Idiot/dp/0440508649) called *Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot*.  It's actually a really entertaining read. I was not aware, actually, but thats hilarious. So is the book! I suggest that one and Lies and The Lying Liars That Tell Them (with a picture all the Fox talking heads on a large TV screen behind Al in the cover photo). and Limbaugh was an idiot long before he said this. So it goes Holy fuck this comment chain is amazing.  Despite most being negative, I highly suggest reading it.   People's worldviews are fucking vitorol right now. Thanks for recommending. It's a good reminder of how people think and behave politically We are living in a cold civil war. he said he's going to resign "in the coming weeks."  He hasn't actually resigned yet, and may drag this out for some time. The only reason I see him saying he will resign in the coming weeks is he wants to be there for final resolution on the Tax Bill and the bill to keep the government funded and prevent a government shutdown. I've been through this entire thread and the amount of polarization is just disheartening. This country is so fucked. The anonymity of online forums like this allow people to be much more extreme in their views then they allow themselves to be in real life.  Does the anonymity of the ballot box not do the same? I was talking more about debates in public forums as opposed to debates online. Oh, gotcha gotcha. I was just defending the aspect that the representatives of the US are at a polarization never before seen, and that's ultimately far worse. The extremes said on here are put into action during secure majorities. I've had the opportunity to live in a few countries and rest assured every country has its strengths and its weaknesses, and every country is made of a populace of generally good people often governed by generally shitty people. America isn't as unique as you may think in that regard.  Anyone else feel like sexually assaulted women are being used as pawns in political chess moves? The mistreatment of women has always being used to incite wars. Those damn Romans. Stole the Sabine women. Those damn Trojans. Stole Helen from Sparta.      Amazing how Democrats get together and say "You gotta go, you're hurting the party." but Republicans can't show the slightest hint of integrity and do the same with Roy Moore.   EDIT: I see a lot of people missed the story where Trump has doubled down his support for Moore:  AUBURN, Ala. — President Trump on Monday strongly endorsed Roy S. Moore, the Republican nominee for a United States Senate seat here, prompting the Republican National Committee to restore its support for a candidate accused of sexual misconduct against teenage girls.  From here: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/us/politics/roy-moore-donald-trump.html &gt; Amazing how Democrats get together and say "You gotta go, you're hurting the party."  Republicans don't say that because it's not true for them. This shit actually hurts the Democrats because the people who vote Dem actually care about this stuff. Republican voters do not. "But he molested teenagers!" "Did you *HEAR* how many times he said he loved America?" "Yes! America was 14!!!" Once again, Dems have hanged themselves by their own standards, while GOP doesn't even agree that it's a standard.  Do they really think that Trump or Moore will step aside now that Franken has? As if they follow his lead or respect him in any way, shape, or form?  I'm not saying that he should have stayed on, if you're a sexual harasser you should step aside. They have just completely failed to get mass consensus from their opponents. They will regret Franken resigning so soon. Precedent set. Sexual assault, misconduct, and allegations of the like lead to resignation on the left, but political backing from the right.  Voters will decide who they support in the next round of elections. Until then we wait. That’s not how precedent works. At all.  Ignoring for a moment the tribalism that has become US politics, the descent into sexual assault madness is troubling. Mere accusation is sufficient to ruin someone’s life. With Franken there was strong evidence but there is an ethics investigation and a legal process in the works. Running a campaign of harrassment is close to a modern lynch mob. And that’s why has happened here with the nonstop pressure for him to resign.  I’m a little troubled by how this has ended. It’s not healthy from a judicial perspective. Did he do it or not? In the eyes of the public, yes. But the public is gullible and easily manipulated. If mob mentality is where we are going to take things it’s going to get ugly. I don't know many people who aren't troubled by this.  The average person can see that the situation is completely spiraling out of control.  But what can we do?  We've watched, apathetically, for years as the ingredients for this mess have fallen into place.  I'm disheartened and concerned, but certainly not surprised.   Voters on the left:  "I'm very concerned about how long it took the party to get right on sexual assault allegations against Conyers and Franken"  Voters on the right: "Our team is winning!! rah rah rah!" I don't think he should've resigned. This sets a precedent where accusations alone can destroy careers. Make no mistake, this problem is only going to get worse. I don't know if he's guilty or innocent, but damn the Democrats really turned on him. Almost seems like he was sacrificed to pressure Moore. America stands on the precipice of a fresh moral panic. Buckle up, buttercup.  On the precipice? We're full on in it right now. While this sucks since I agree with him politically and he is my senator here in Minnesota, we can't have a double standard of going after Conservatives for sexual harassment and not doing the same to Liberals. I'm sad it came to this and wish him the best. I hope whoever replaces him carries on with progressive ideals. JFC all these Democrats climbing over each other to shoot their own with Republican-provided bullets.  Taking the high road didn't work in 2016 and won't work the next time.  He had no other choice  Almost every Democratic Senator said you have to go Now I'd like to see what Republican Senators say when Roy Moore steps into the building. Here, I'll answer that: "Welcome! Please vote for our agenda." "The other guy (who prosecuted KKK murderers) is weak on crime. So vote for our candidate! So what if he's a pedophile, he's *our* pedophile."  Not only did he prosecute KKK members, he also prosecuted child predators. Ironic. If there is something Democrats love more than losing, its losing while screwing another democrat over. This party is a fucking mess, no wonder Republicans keep winning.   The DNC showed they haven't learned any lessons from the past two decades and still will let the GOP control the narrative. They wont flip Congress in 2018.
 I guess I could understand banning books called "How to Escape from Prison."  Not sure how a book about the true meaning of Christmas made the list.  They ban pop up books. Nothing to do with the content.   Other banned children's books are out for similar issues, the hardcovers of many kids books can be extra durable and thick and this has led to contraband or weapons issues.  I had to scroll way too far to get to an actual explanation, damn. Thank you! This seems perfectly reasonable, to me. I'd rather they're banning books for practical reasons rather than political ones, no matter how abhorrent.  The only real inconsistency I found in their policy in this article is that Freakonomics was banned in part due to the segment on race, but Mein Kampf and some of David Duke’s books were allowed (I’ve never read any of these books but I can’t imagine you can get much more incendiary than professional racists). Freaknomics also pretty much explains how to set up an organzied crime ring, which is a direct threat to prison safety. Mein Kampf really only sorta explains why an early 20th century european should hate the jewry. It's more of danger evaluation thing than an ideology thing, I think. Mein Kampf is also damn near unreadable: even people who have to read it is part of a requirement rarely manage to do more than skim it, if that. I have read it, it is probably partly translation issues, but it was not particularly easy or fun to read. It has been over a decade since I read it, but I remember it being tough to get thorough. It's worse in german. A drunk 8 year old could write more coherent. Apparently the whole title is "My Struggle with the German Language." Mein Kampf (mit Deutsch) I am imagining an 8 year old saying "hold my beer" So, a German 8 year old. *Coherently    Source: Am a drunk 8 year old. I always completely fuck up that word... English be hard man. It's supposedly just as awful in German as well. its not translation issues Yeah, I read in Ian Kershaw's biography of Hitler that it was kind of a common joke in Nazi Germany that everyone owned Mein Kampf but nobody actually read it because it was so poorly written. Misdirection titles on Reddit are popular these days ~~God forbid you read the article!~~ Heh, I would've, but I'm out of NYT articles this month.  Why not just get softcover versions? Oh man they could do “prison edition” releases just like international edition textbooks They might, the article cites specifically the pop up version. Also maybe children's books don't have softcover versions, because if you've ever dealt with toddlers, they'll tear up pages and covers of books for fun. So it completely depends on if the publisher makes a soft cover version available.  I don’t know if this is true but it sounds good &gt; According to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice's policies, a book, magazine or other publication can be banned because it contains:  &gt; * Information on the manufacture of explosives, weapons and/or drugs.  &gt; * "Material that a reasonable person would construe as written solely for the purpose of communicating information designed to achieve the breakdown of prisons through offender disruption," like strikes or riots.  &gt; * "Graphic presentations" of illegal sex acts, "such as rape, incest, sex with a minor, bestiality, necrophilia or bondage." Sexually explicit images. "Naked or partially covered buttocks" does not constitute reason for automatic disapproval. Staff review medical journals, reference materials, art books and other publications containing nudity on a case-by-case basis.  &gt; * Information on criminal schemes or "how to avoid detection of criminal schemes."  &gt; * The book can also be banned for how it's manufactured. If the binding, cover or other parts can be used to hide contraband, it won't be allowed.  &gt;That's why several pop-up books, such as Harry Potter Film Wizardry and The Amazing Spider-Man, were banned. Other children's titles like Hello Kitty and the Homer Simpson book were put on the disapproved list because they had "uninspectable" covers or "multi-layer pages."  &gt;Waldo may have stripes, but he's a no-show in Texas prisons this Christmas because his book "contains stickers."

This is so true I saw a guy who liked to take top ramen packets and make purses, belts, and photo frames in jail! Oh and a shank made from the center of the deodorant. I would however put out there I was not a fellow inmate just a 16 year old criminal justice student so they showed us all kinds of crazy things.  Ey, boy, you wanna learn about criminal justice? How about you learn some street justice first!   *stabs you with deodorant, you wind up smelling amazing the rest of the day* When you're stuck in a cell for over 20 hours a day, you'll eventually find a way to kill someone with the little resources you have Necessity is the mother of invention. The article states it is a book that could easily hide contraband (presumably because of its extra thick pages). Assuming that it's a normal pop-up book, it's got thick pages, as well as gaps in them to account for different pop-up scenes.  It's rather logical. I've heard people argue that Die Hard is a Christmas movie. Never heard the one about Men Kampf being a Christmas classic.    It is if you want a white Christmas. Rudolph the Anti-Semitic Reindeer is one of my favorite Christmas songs. Santa Claus is Comin to Poland is definitely my all time favorite I'll Be Home for Kristallnacht is a classic "Rudolph the red nose Panzer" is better.

This all got way too dark "Slayin jews are you listening.  See their blood as it glistens.  It's a wonderful day  I'm happy to say   Waffin in a winter wonderland." Deck the halls with shower heads... It's a mouthful, but "All I want for Christmas, is a genetically pure superior race" has a catchy rhythm to it.

Reworking classics like Frosty the Aryan. Frosty the Yes Man, was a man without a soul.  Fun fact: die hard is based on a book titled Nothing Lasts Forever by Roderick Thorp. It's a fun yet short book that any fan of the movies would love, as it shows the inspiration that sparked the classic film.  &gt; I've heard people argue that Die Hard is a Christmas movie  [People argue against that?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0CL__Tvp-o) it IS a Christmas Movie!  I think everyone should read mein kampf once. Not because it's a good book but because it's a very bad book that romanticizes righteous indignation at perceived injustices. For propaganda such as that book to be avoided and countered we must be well versed at recognizing it. We live in a world where morality is recognized more often from who wins an argument than who is actually morally correct. That book is a useful tool at demonstrating exactly how people can be manipulated against their own interests. You have to understand the enemy if you wish to battle him as he will battle against you.  This point is decent. Once tried reading it but got so fucking bored that I didn't feel like bothering. It genuinely has the feel of some low-budget religious pamphlet given out by fundies on streets. it's almost impossible to understand because it has so much about local politics of the time I've heard it's also worse in German than it is in English. Apparently the translators tend to clean up some of the incoherence. [deleted] It's actually a tradition in my house.  Well that's because Die Hard *is* a Christmas movie calling die hard anything less than a christmas classic for the whole family is sacrilege Die Hard is absolutely a Christmas movie and no one can tell me otherwise.  They actually have a die hard Christmas book now, hopefully that’s not banned too &gt; the pop-up edition of “A Charlie Brown Christmas” is prohibited (could hide contraband inside it)  Just saying. Title is a little misleading... I wish that they had more titles like this.  I loved how they buried the reason a little bit in the article.  No one should mention the reason and just let the plebs argue over the title Not just a 'little', it is meant to invoke outrage and create the false notion that the Texas bureaucracy is incompetent/unwise.  I'm not an American and can't do anything about an American news outlet but I'm disgusted by this kind of journalism.  Meant to elicit a response and it's the millionth time we've seen an article like this on all. It's amazing how many comments here are raging on the book title being banned. It's not the book title, it's the binding and construction of the book itself.  The pop-up version of Mein Kampf would be banned too No worries, the guards will still snuggle them in like they do with all the drugs  Edit: there is no fucking way I'm correcting my misspelling.

Was thinking this ban is because Charlie Brown Christmas is big enough to hide contraband in.  It has spaces for sounds effects, batteries and such.  Thinking the kiddie sound effects version of Mein Kampf has yet to come out.  (Although his thoughts on exterminating Jews as the work of the Lord could be somewhat considered Christmassy?  Maybe not.) I mean there was a certain amount of people going *up* chimneys Some of those books are banned for perfectly valid reasons, like they might have potential to hide weapons. They generally don't ban for content unless it's explicitly violent or depicts criminal acts.  &gt;  like they might have potential to hide weapons  Sounds like a good reason to ban certain editions. But I hear you can hide a rock hammer in a bible. I mean I'm actually with the ACLU. I think they should be able to access the same books we get, but I just hate these clickbait headlines that suck the nuance out of everything. They have policies that, however hamfisted, are at least consistently enforced.  This is the main push for a movement to tablets in many states, it's infinitely harder to smuggle material in this way.  Lots of contraband moves through the libraries and with so many books it is next to impossible to inspect every single book on a regular basis.  It's also easier to track communication electronically.  One the second day of our facility using the e-messaging system on our tablets our filters caught someone threatening to commit suicide and we were able to send the local police to do a wellness check and pull the inmate into an office to let them know what happened and that everything was ok within hours of the message being sent.  A week earlier and it would have taken three days or so to find out anything was wrong. Interesting!  But aren't tablets themselves usable as weapons? And contain a lot of pointy metal?   Just curious. Yes, they could be used as a blunt weapon, but he amount of metal in them is quite small.  Ours are made of clear plastic and cost $200, the inmate receives the first one free, if they are broken the inmate pays for a replacement.  This is of no-cost to the tax payer because a private company provides the tablets and in return generates a small amount of revenue from the use of phone and messaging services, which is still cheaper than a stamp for the inmates.  Our tablets have access to six websites (CNN, WhiteHouse.gov, can't remember the others but they are all news sites) and no commenting privileges for those sites.  They also have access to music and a small number of games (company has to pay for the tablets and infrastructure somehow).  The tablets have been instrumental in reducing violence in our units because now people can remain in their cells and still access to phone calls and entertainment which allows potential victims to remain in the safety of their cells.  The units are also quieter now as there's less people moving around and less commotion, which makes it easier to supervise the units.  Another advantage is that we no longer have to read every piece of mail, our filters flag suspect material for review before it is released, but over 90% of the mail goes through without a problem.  Six months on we've had zero instances of a tablet being used as a weapon and we believe the pros far outweigh the cons.  We track all violence in our facilities and we have seen a dramatic drop in inmate-on-inmate and inmate-on-staff assaults since the tablets went live six months ago. You guys documenting all this? Would make for a great paper or report for public consumption.  Our Warden has done several interviews with local media because this is a hot button issue, many people in this state watch The Shawshank Redemption and think those guys had it soft and prison should be more punitive. easy enough to detect when a connected tablet goes dark/offnetwork and check in on it. Also, if you put enough valuable stuff on the tablet (commissary access, visitor access, card games, virtual library), and have the camera constantly feeding back to a security post, few inmates would risk messing with it as it would be extremely traceable, visible, and screw them over inside. &gt;clickbait headlines that suck the nuance out of everything.  So basically ~~facebook~~ ~~reddit~~ ~~the internet~~ ~~America~~ ~~modern civilization~~ the fucking human race for all of eternity. If you wet the pages, roll, squeeze, and allow it to dry, a bible *becomes* a hammer. Millwall Brick anyone? Someone above in the comments pointed out that hardcovers of childrens books can be used to make weapons which is why they are sometimes banned. Well, thank god they banned "How to Fake a Moon Landing." We don't need any of these knockoff Kubricks picking up tips while they're doing time. Let's face it, no matter what books are on the ban list there's going to be a bunch of fucked up titles that are allowed. So, why bother banning any?! Alcatraz allowed a book titled "How to Build a Raft," so yeah, why bother? I'm kind of surprised that building a raft would be enough of a topic to fill an entire book. Probably detailed multiple methods of raft building depending on the materials and tools at hand. I like to think that there are factions within the raft building world, different schools of thought that they were comparing etc. And then they have a tournament and fight. There'll be an anime about raft-building with tournaments and drama and amazing fuckin' music.  About raft-making.  They can make volleyball entertaining, they can do raft-making, too. Dude, they made an anime about cycling that has more drama when people drop out of the race than people fucking dying.  It's great. Haha I can picture it now. Crazy music and monologues followed by an intense scream in agony as they decide they can't go on and have to drop out and continue their normal lives.   Like all that shit happens than off camera the character just kind of looks around a little embarrased, grabs their bike, and walks home while the dramatic music disappears in the distance with the rest of the racers When tying a knot becomes 3 filler episodes. knot-chan has noticed meee It's not like I wanted you to be tied, two-half-hitches-chan. ...Baka. Id watch it. You could easily make it some crazy shonin where it's crazy survive or die obstacle courses where only one team can live and be crowned raft kings at the end  Sponsored by Red Bull.  [Relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1095/) Exactly, they should have checked out Building a Raft from Materials Commonly Found in Prison when Locked in that Same Prison.  No wonder they were in prison, the buffoons. 'Monte Cristo, you'll like it, it's about a prison break' 'Should we file it as Educational too?' If the requirements for such a raft are tools and lumber and the like, then such a book would probably be useless to an escaped inmate on Alcatraz anyway.  If anything keeping that book around was probably just their way of taunting the prisoners. That's how the world's most famous prison break got away, they built a inflatable raft out of raincoats.  didn't read the article, eh?   most of what they banned were because of how the books were constructed physically could be used to smuggle stuff in. it didn't have a lot to do with the actual content of the stories/books. Theoretically the ban exists to keep out things that could potentially aid a convicts in breaking out, getting outside communications, fashioning weapons, or smuggling contraband goods.  Because, if you read the article, it's not always the content, it's also that the books can be used to hide contraband. In the cases where it is content, its because some things just become masturbation material for sex offenders.  &gt;But the pop-up edition of “A Charlie Brown Christmas” is prohibited (could hide contraband inside it), as is “The Color Purple,” the 1983 novel that won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award (incest).  That said, its pretty obvious its arbitrary on what does and doesn't violate the standards. The Bible also has incest, and violence. I don't know if Mein Kamph actually advocates violence, despite the horribleness of the author, it's maybe one of those that taken out of context of the author, doesn't technically violate any standards (haven't actually read it so don't know). Then again, if you're going to ban Freakonomics for violating standards for discussing race, I don't think you have a leg to stand on to justify allowing Mein Kamph. ... You mean to say that you don't believe in curtailing the constitutional rights of incarcerated persons? What are you, a communist?  *That was sarcasm...* I think its funny (in a very not-funny way) that we assume prisoners do not have rights. They have all of the same rights as a free person minus, maybe, 2a. I just started a documentary series on the Miami-Dade jail and its fucking eye opening how brutal the system really is.   If i was jailed I don't know what I'd do if released. I would not want to reform.   The folks in this show (netflix) are innocent (pre trial) and its a fucking terrifying environment. One dude had a suspended license and drove. Got his ass beat by 12 dudes and the guards look the other way.   Cant remember the name of the show but its Louis Theroux who does the telling of the tale.  Maybe read the article.  It's the pop-up version of *A Charlie Brown Christmas* that is banned, and not due to content but because you can hide contraband in it. Its odd that they ban Color Purple for incest, but not Lolita for... well. I've never read The Color Purple, but I have read Lolita.  The relationship isn't exactly celebrated.  Unless that incest results in the character being exposed as despicable, pathetic monster and results in his total undoing, then it's not really a comparison.   The main character's father beats and rapes her. So it was banned because it depicts rape and not because it was incest? The article says the reason was incest. Will Reddit read the article this time? Let's find out! This is really misleading.   After looking at the list, other books **allowed** include The Royal Parchment of Black Supremacy, The Communist Manifesto, and the Diary of Che Guevara.   Way to mislead the public into seeing a deepening racial divide, NYTimes.  This is the dumbest article I've ever seen   &gt;But the pop-up edition of “A Charlie Brown Christmas” is prohibited (could hide contraband inside it)  So the non pop up edition is fine?  Edit: Supposedly, the pop up edition of Mein Kampf is also banned. Yes. All pop up books are banned. There was a better article about this that hit the front page a couple weeks ago that actually went into why different books were banned That's what it sounds like.   I mean, I find that to be reasonable.  &gt;This is the dumbest article I've ever seen    That doesn't matter to the New York Times, what's important is that their advertising sales people can tell potential advertisers that you (and X number of other people) saw it. This article is so shit that its own subtext and content in parentheses argue against its main premise. It was painful to read.  Its not banned because of the content, its banned because its a pop up book with a hardcover that inmates use to make contraband. For those being outraged by the headline of banning books, there are some reasons why they do it:  &gt; According to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice's policies, a book, magazine or other publication can be banned because it contains:  &gt; * Information on the manufacture of explosives, weapons and/or drugs.  &gt; * "Material that a reasonable person would construe as written solely for the purpose of communicating information designed to achieve the breakdown of prisons through offender disruption," like strikes or riots.  &gt; * "Graphic presentations" of illegal sex acts, "such as rape, incest, sex with a minor, bestiality, necrophilia or bondage." Sexually explicit images. "Naked or partially covered buttocks" does not constitute reason for automatic disapproval. Staff review medical journals, reference materials, art books and other publications containing nudity on a case-by-case basis.  &gt; * Information on criminal schemes or "how to avoid detection of criminal schemes."  &gt; * The book can also be banned for how it's manufactured. If the binding, cover or other parts can be used to hide contraband, it won't be allowed.  &gt;That's why several pop-up books, such as Harry Potter Film Wizardry and The Amazing Spider-Man, were banned. Other children's titles like Hello Kitty and the Homer Simpson book were put on the disapproved list because they had "uninspectable" covers or "multi-layer pages."  &gt;Waldo may have stripes, but he's a no-show in Texas prisons this Christmas because his book "contains stickers."  [ Source](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/2017/11/27/texas-prisons-ban-freakonomics-big-book-angels-adolf-hitlers-mein-kampf)  There's a lot of reasons why they ban books. Some prisoners can be crafty little fuckers, so the prisons have to be very careful with what they allow them access too. It'd be cool if some of the book makers made special 'Prison Editions' but I doubt they see much of a reason to do it unfortunately. I would love for them to have access to a lot more literature, but I understand why a lot of the books go on the ban list.  God damn Reddit is becoming fucking awful I’m sick of the misleading and flat out retarded headlines. Just a reminder - most of the banned books are because of physical attributes such as the type of binding. "Texas Prisons ban 10,000 books. No Pop-Up books or other contraband-prone designs. Normally printed books are allowed."  A more accurate and less inflammatory headline.  How many times have we seen this news now? At this point, we should start calling it "olds". What happened to not editorializing titles? Aryan Brotherhood is a big deal inside of prisons.  Taking away Mein Kampf would start some bad prison riots. Yea you don't want WHITE POWER BiLL startin shit You mean Dirty Ears Bill, right? That's like giving a child what they want because they throw a tantrum. Except some of those children have nothing to lose and are willing to kill.  A few years ago I read an article about prison gangs in California. It said that one out of every ten inmate murders in USA are committed by the Aryan Brotherhood, making them the most murderous prison gang in country. These guys kill more people then the Mexican Mafia. ITT people who are outraged because they didn't read the article.  Could be Charlie Brown Christmas was banned for depictions of children.  Could be its paper was used as rolling paper.  Could be people kept stealing the pages as artwork.  Could be people were getting so sad reading it they killed themselves.  Prisons are weird. Pop up books are thicker and easier to hide contraband in.  As stated in the article Why did you read the article when you could have just made assumptions? The article clearly states that it was a pop up book and that all pop up books are banned because of the potential for hiding contraband. We also don't know if *Mein Kampf* was actually reviewed.  Just the pop up version is banned. They were probably making shit out of the cardboard or ripping them out just because.  You could easily find out why by reading the article instead of trying to make a silly joke. Their logic for banning certain books is sound and the titles this writer picked in order to make this a sensationalist article remind why the New York Times is the failing New York Times. Oh another shit on Texas article. Fun.  ITT: people who didn't read the article and can't understand why Charlie Brown was banned Politically charged title that doesn't explain the practical contraband-based reasons behind the book bans. Thanks Reddit for being prejudiced, divisive, and race-baiting all day and every day. 
 What the fuck is with those judiciary decisions to grant those warrants??? Jesus Christ those judges need to be removed. Time to search the judge's house to see if he's a pedophile too.  It is the perfect place for one. All that "trial evidence" in the basement for safe keeping With inexplicable stains all over them.... it was spooky ghost! Maybe he was just eating a salad when reviewing them and got ranch everywhere.  Maybe not - but we should write up the case like "Did you know your neighbor, $NAME, abused his position as judge to assist pedofiles?" then deliver it to all the neighbors. The same ones that make teens register as sex offender for sending nudes to one another. They act as if they're some big moral compass deserving of praise when they're really just ruining teens lives that happened to me and i have PTSD now  :) Sorry to hear that and I hope you're coping with it in a healthy way! From my few interactions with police I have bad anxiety just seeing one driving by. I can't imagine what it must be like having your life torn up by them..  &gt;I can't imagine what it must be like having your life torn up by them..  the real killer is that i never thought i had committed a crime so i never had reason to believe the police would be after me. then one day they literally kicked in my door and stuck a gun in my face. i have constant anxiety attacks thinking the police are after me, because why wouldn't they be? real life has showed me already you do not need to have a logically sound reason to be after someone, you don't need to remember you broke the law to have broken it, nor do you even have to try or want to break it. I live in constant terror that I'm going to accidentally break the law and go to jail for my entire life and rarely leave my house.  thats not even discussing the pre-freudian methods (and *THEIR* long lasting effects I'm sure you can imagine.) employed in the sex offender therapy i was forced to attend as a term of probation even though i didn't need to be there. Have you considered doing an AMA?  many years ago when i was freshly out of all that mess i considered it and was denied and my post removed because it "wasn't unique" You could try (forgive me if this is the wrong sub, i'm too lazy to check) /r/casualiama removed?  You are much nicer than me.  Judges rarely actually read warrant applications.  It's one of the areas of our justice system that needs *massive* reform.  Judges are supposed to be a check on the ability of law enforcement to search people's homes/possessions/cars/whatever, but are instead little more than a rubber stamp. Need to remove this current system.  And replace it with a system that has blackjack and hookers! In fact, forget the system and the blackack! It's not supposed to happen, but I bet often times a judge will just rubber stamp everything on his desk. Doesn't absolve them of responsibility. An explanation isn't necessarily an excuse. Exactly. He approved a child being viagrad up and forced to masturbate in front of a pedophile. His stamp is on that form. If my signature was on something like that I'd be in jail pretty damn fast. I could throw around "I barely even read it!" all I want. As u/Mikeavelli said, I wasn't making a value judgment really. The judge as immunity though, more than likely. The judge probably had a big stack of papers and just had his assistant stamp each one. It doesn't make it right though, no. &gt;When this bizarre effort was unsuccessfully attempted, Abbott then obtained a second warrant authorizing police to escort Sims to a hospital for an "erection-inducing injection." This injection ultimately never took place after massive public outcry.  &gt;**Abbott committed suicide in December 2015 when officers came to arrest him on separate charges relating to pedophilia.**  After all of that, the cop was a pedophile. That's fucking insane. I feel like that point should have been self evident DURING all that, not after. Maybe his coworkers thought he was just really, *really* dedicated. /s This is disgusting on my part, and kind of shows how my mind works, but this story and your comment reminds me of a South Park episode. The one where one of the leading detectives becomes so zealous at busting Johns that he goes undercover  as a prostitute and spend the episode blowing and being buggered by customers and then arresting them, leaving his colleagues confused and wondering about his dedication.  "thanks baby, you gave my hole quite the STRETCH!"  “Th... t.... that’s the code word guys!” This happened in real life with our very own President Roosevelt - The Newport Sex Scandal  https://www.thedailybeast.com/franklin-d-roosevelts-forgotten-anti-gay-sex-crusade DAMN IT YOU BEAT ME TO IT.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_sex_scandal  The Dollop podcast did an episode on it.  Highly recommend. Idk, it seems less disgusting then a testament to how tapped into our sick culture South Park is. what episode is that? i have to watch that! Butters bottom bitch Bitch don't you want to start making some real fuckin money? You knowimsayin'? Yes I think I know what you are saying. It's the one where Butters becomes a pimp. Yes I understand what you are saying. Daddy I did good. I did real good. Can I have a smiley face sticker?  That whole scene cracks me up. "Do you *know*. What I am *SAYING*." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImYci3uWXbg    for the lazy The evidence bags... Teens become registered sex offenders by having a photo of their own body. That's, a criminal record and their futures ruined because they saw their own naked body.      In the meantime, there are cops looking at child porn all day. They possess it as evidence. In some cases, they're directly examining and photographing teenage boys' penises. Cops are just as prone to being sickos as anybody else... arguably more. Of *course* there's going to be pedophiles sprinkled into the police force. But in the meantime, they are literally the only people who are viewing, possessing, and creating child "pornography" with impunity. By policy, they are doing it. And if that detective didn't eventually get outed as a pedophile, I'm sure everything he did according to this case would stand and be defended by the system.      My point is, how fucked up is it that your 15 year old kid can get a criminal record and be labeled a sex offender for seeing his own dick and balls, but any 'ol detective can come along and say "We need to see this kid's erect dick and balls" and a judge goes "Okie dokie!"? Why isn't the judge's named mentioned and why isn't he also being sued?  The judge is expected to have more legal knowledge than an investigator I would imagine, and would think that the judge who signed the warrant would be at least as liable as the officer.   Either way, pretty insane stuff.   Yeah, if they're saying that the cop doesn't get qualified immunity because it was so obviously unconstitutional then that judge needs to be removed from the bench ASAP. I am just picturing one officer saying  "Hey guys, I think this guy might be a pedo."   And everyone else going,   "... no, that doesn't seem right"  Then officer A hopefully started to investigate.  What's *really* insane is that a judge issued a warrant to authorize an erection-induced injection. That judge should be disbarred.  That judge should not just be disbarred, but fucking prosecuted and thrown in jail. As well as the prosecuting attorney. He is just as disgraceful, if not more, than the judge.  Or do the same as Abbott. Bet he was a pedo buddy of the cop. Open an investigation into him. Judge, Abbot, prosecuting attorney and anyone else involved in allowing this to move forward should be removed from their jobs and a billboard showing what they authorized should be displayed in their hometowns and on their front lawn.   Everything that I said above is crazy, but is it as crazy as a cop asking to see a kids pee pee.  Abbot can't be removed from his job, because he's dead. He committed suicide when he was being investigated for charges relating to pedophelia. &gt; He committed suicide when he was being investigated for charges relating to pedophelia.  What an unlikely turn of events! Are you seriously telling me that the police officer who tried to use the legal system to restrain a teenage boy and educe medical professionals to use prescription narcotics to make him aroused against his will so he could photograph it was a pedophile? I just can't believe it!   Exactly. The judge is supposed to be a check to prevent this sort of thing. The judge is equally as culpable as the cop. And not just *one* ruling, *but two* against the privacy and sanctity of a child's body. Disgusting. I'll take "Shit that doesn't surprise me" for $1000, Alex. &gt; Abbott then obtained a second warrant authorizing police to escort Sims to a hospital for an "erection-inducing injection."  The judge who approved this should be tarred and feathered. I dont usually advocate for out-of-band justice, but seriously, fuck that judge. That's my first thought as well.  How the fuck did Abbott even got the warrant?  What kind of judge would approve such a thing?  An accomplice  I can't decide which warrant is crazier though:   * Warrant to photograph minor's erection  * If minor can't (or won't) get hard,  Warrant to take minor to hospital and (forcibly?) have his dick injected with boner drugs.   Ok now I'm genuinely curious... did the warrant explicitly authorize force during any of this... if it did, how in the hell is the judge still practicing ?   A porno judge. Did they investigate the judge for pedophilia? IMO he is more liable than Abbott is.    Cops ask for illegal warrants all the time.... Because they don't study law for years.  It is the judges job and not the cops to determine whether a warrant is illegal or not.   I read it first thinking the kid committed suicide and then saw the name again and was like WTF?!!  Yeah, when I first read that, I was so sad that these evil people made this kid kill himself. Then I realized it was the cop who committed suicide, and I was glad.  I know that's not a very Christlike attitude, but that was my initial impulse. I hate when the wicked take advantage of the innocent or weak. My sense of "justice" trumpets, and I imagine a world without selfish, evil people who prey on others. I'm trying to rid my character of said impulses; but, for now, it remains. the world is a better place without him.  this is a human reaction. I remember this. Totally sickening.  We’ll never really know how many people he got to. I’m glad he’s dead, but would rather see him in prison.  Why? Then he's just soaking up tax dollars. Good riddance. I grew up in Manassas. There was a local Sheriff's deputy who lived down the street from me. He was arrested for possession of child pornography. I know his name and everything. Manassas is a fucked up place. They were the first locality to pioneer the kind of policing that made Arpaio (the Arizona policeman Trump pardoned) infamous in the first place. &gt;Shapiro   I think to you mean Arpaio. To us its insane.  To the Pedophile Police Detective investigating Child Pornography, he probably saw it as an opportunity to obtain new pictures for his own purposes. prosecutor that went along with this travesty should commit suicide too.   I'd rather he be kept alive and made an example of.   This type of behavior needs to be shamed in the most extreme way possible. Him killing himself and leaving behind a ghost story doesn't change the system. Him being made an example of and D.A.'s/judges/Civil Rights Groups using him as an example would serve the system as a whole better.  Trust me, I understand your sentiment and I agree with you in the disgust/outrage factor. That being said, him being haunted by this and using this against the courts is better for the system as a whole. ???   I cant imagine why anyone would require anyone to get an injection that causes an erecvtion for the lw.  WHy was this like five paragraphs in. Should be the lede. PEDOPHILE cop forced teen to masturbate.  His erection-inception injection suggestion was met with rejection?  Good thing they questioned intentions despite his profession and dispensed poor reception.  Seems like staff got on subreption prevention once he mentioned detention. If you want to be really outraged, read King's dissenting opinion on this case.  To Judge King all police officers have a moral duty to uphold the sanctity of every court order without hesitation, and there's nothing unconstitutional about forcing a 17 year old to jack off under duress in front of a bunch of grown, armed men.  Our justice system, ladies and gentlemen. That was the opinion of 1/3rd of the judges who decided this case.  https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4323254-162174-P.html#document/p21  Edit: Victim was 17 y/o, not 15. So the judge says “I was just following orders” is a moral imperative regardless of the situation? Couldn't even make up this crazy shit. [The Migram experiment is still very relevant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment) it shows that this type of thinking is extremely common in all people.   People extremely capable of rationalizing their evil acts as being the fault of an authority rather than themselves.  *Milgram  The results of this study are literally terrifying when you think about it. Really vivid lesson on why you should always question authority, at least internally. Sounds like something a Nazi would say! (Oh shit they did) I think that was actually the rationale behind the study originally. To understand how seemingly ordinary people could be capable of horrid deals in Nazi Germany. I can’t believe preparing to take pictures of a minor masturbating would even be justifiable for collecting evidence. Wouldn’t the officers be especially making child pornography? &gt; Wouldn’t the officers be especially making child pornography?  No, no, no. When the state does it it's not illegal. Cuz... reasons. Hm..... where have I heard this before?  /s You don't know how sarcasm works. You'd be amazed how many people that logic appeals to. Whenever I bring up misconduct in the justice system to right wingers the response "but it's the law!" comes up, as if a judge or politician ordering something is the only thing that separates right from wrong in America Yeah... that's sexual coercion and maybe rape.  "Do this sex act against your will or go to jail!"  "Do this sex act or I'll stab you with a knife!"  What's the fucking difference? A jail houses prisoners, a knife cuts things. Shit. We need a new argument  He starts quoting the Federalist Papers...I couldn't read anymore laughing too hard. Contains 1000% DV of dietary irony. Life in prison.  You don’t fuck around being a judge. You can’t be that demented. Who knows who and what else this man has damaged.  Life in prison. definitely needs to be thoroughly investigated and *ALL* of his previous cases and rulings reviewed in excruciating detail. This is just......my god, wow. How is that not child porn? The first thing that irritates me, which shouldn't, is the Judge's use of M dashes. I spend a fuck ton of time learning how to do shit like properly cite shit from some ivy-league shit guide called the Bluebook. When Judges don't care, I don't know why I should, either, but that's beside the main point.  Second, I don't understand how a Judge could reasonably believe the police didn't violate any rights here. Per the dissent's opinion, on p. 25, the search warrant reads:  &gt; To any authorized officer: &gt; You are hereby commanded in the name of the Commonwealth to &gt; forthwith search the following place, person, or thing either in day or night: &gt; Trey Austin Sims, Date of Birth []. A white male, &gt; approximately 5’10” tall and approximately 150 pounds. &gt; For the following property, objects and/or persons: &gt; Photographs of the genitals, hands, and other parts of the &gt; body of Trey Sims that will be used as comparisons in &gt; recovered forensic evidence from the victim and suspect’s &gt; electronic devices. This includes a photograph of the &gt; suspect’s erect penis.  I imagine that the methods of executing a search warrant vary and, depending on the circumstances, merit some action done at the discretion of the police to achieve its means. Thus, if obtaining the photographs meant retrieving the phone, yes the police are authorized to retrieve the phone. Police may need a separate warrant to unlock the phone if the user secured it with a PIN. A completely separate question, but also something that a warrant can be issued for.   But for a Judge to think that this warrant authorizes police to achieve these photos by requiring a target furnish them live is absurd. In the above hypothetical, police assume the pictures already exist. It's just a matter of accessing them. What the Judge looks like he's condoning is requiring someone to create something that, but for the police's request, would not have existed. Gross.  If anyone can enlighten me otherwise, I'm open to conversation. But the Judge's dissent is disturbing. Judge King is a Clinton nominee, believe it or not. pedophile cop tried to use the courts to legally take pics of a teen masturbating, failed, got busted as a pedophile on an unrelated event and committed suicide. court now says the teen can sue his estate.... what in the fuckity fuck... good he can sue but that is some crazy shit.   I vote for a slight tweaking of "The Aristocrats". At first I was like:  "Eeeeeverybody, eeeeeeevrybody, everybody wants to be a cat"  And then I was like:  "Oh no. God no. No no no no no" &gt;At first I was like:  &gt;"Eeeeeverybody, eeeeeeevrybody, everybody wants to be a cat"  Are you my soulmate? 27 year old male, still watches old Disney movies on a regular basis.  Aladdin is my fave, though. Aristocats was my dad's fave. You are the worst person on the internet.  Take your upvote and get out of my sight. &gt;court now says the teen can use his estate  I'm...*concerned* about the way you said "use his estate." You know what estate means in this context, right?  But yeah, this whole thing is wild. meant sue  In hindsight that should have been obvious to me. Sorry. no problem thanks for pointing it out!  &gt; In a 2-1 majority opinion, the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals found Tuesday that the initial warrant against Sims was an "obvious, unconstitutional violation."  I'd like to imagine after the vote, the two people that voted majority looked over to the third guy and were like, "the fuck man?". [Another comment in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7i6n6y/forcing_kid_to_masturbate_for_cops_in_sexting/dqwi5mp/) goes into how ridiculous that judge is. That shit is crazy, but i guess it does make sense that a pedo would go want to see a kid's dick.   If i was that kid's lawyer, id' also be going after the judge who issued the initial warrant and the one who ok'ed the idea of sending him to a hospital for an erection shot. None of that is OK.  And the prosecutor who gave the cop the go ahead and the other three officers in the room and the supervisors that that didn't put a stop to it.   The whole thing is just surreal and it saddens me that a bunch of adults who cared more about getting a conviction than what is right let it go so far.  That's prosecutors et al. for you And what happens when we use number of convictions as the only metric for judging prosecutors. Of course that didn’t do anything. They all probably go to the each other’s cookouts on the weekends. It’s an old boys club, through and through.  I remember when this happened, Reddit was around, and I was fighting on here against people who were all "the law is the law" and " if put have nothing to hide show them it isn't your dick" and whatever.  Man, fuck you guys, if any of you are still around here.  In their defence, it’s not like there’s no legal precedent for penis viewing to determine if someone might have committed a crime - see [Scott v. Flenderson](https://www.instagram.com/p/yvKjbiADrQ/) So if hypothetically they had got to the point of taking the kid to the hospital for an erection injection, how would that even work? I would hope that any nurse or doctor would refuse to give the drugs because the kid doesn't have erectile dysfunction and it's therefore not medically necessary.  I have no idea. How do even tell a medical provider, "we gotta see this kid jerk off, you know, for justice." I've interacted with a lot of doctors and nurses for my work. A very high percentage of them would react to that order with "get the fuck out of this office/hospital before I call security." You find out your 15 year old daughter is sexting a [17 year old] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2016/05/26/teen-in-manassas-city-sexting-case-sues-prince-william-authorities-for-civil-rights-violations/) and you call the cops. It's just two kids in high school, fuck off and do some parenting This. Why on earth were the fucking authorities brought in the first place?  These are horny teenagers doing dumb shit. I get Mom was pissed. But calling the cops? She had other options before the law needed to be involved. One should not go to police everytime you get pissed off and demand immediate vindication. There can huge unforeseen and horrific consequences when the law gets involved for somethings that could or should of been resolved privately. That being said, that cop would still be destroying children's lives if she didn't call the police. Not to diminish the disgusting and reprehensible behavior of the cop, the prosecutor, the judge, and the like, but this is extremely rare to find the investigating cop a pedophile who has to prove his suspect is a sex predator all the while getting off on said suspect's naked body and forced erection. Thankfully, this all came to light. It could have ended much worse and the boy branded a sex offender for life and the cop still doing his evil shit. This Makes me believe there is still some cosmic karma still floating around there.  If porn has taught me anything, the Mom should have taught her daughter a lesson by fucking her boyfriend. Poor kid is probably scarred for life, tough. PTSD.  I mean, he was violated in a horrible manner. Imagine being forced to masturbate like that. That must have fucked him up badly. That’s some sick shit. I hope someone paid a therapist for him and he went on to have a good life and a mostly normal relationship with his own body, with masturbation - and with other people.  I’d never be able to trust any potential partner again after that (or their parents).   Still can’t believe what the fuck I just read in that article. &gt; It states that the incident began when Sims’ girlfriend sent nude photos of herself to him by cell phone, which the girl’s mother identified at Sims’ trial in 2014. Sims responded with “an explicit video of himself via his cell phone,” Glasberg wrote, though Abbott testified that the sender’s face was not visible. The girl’s mother reported the video to the Manassas City police. Sims was then charged with manufacturing and distributing child pornography, but the girl was not. Glasberg said Richardson and Abbott only charged Sims because he is male, a violation of his equal protection rights.   So their solution was to create more child porn for the department for forensic analysis and research. Wow Anyone else pissed off at the mother for calling the cops over a 15 year old sexting another 15 year old? Easier to call the cops than do some actual parenting. &gt;The female, who had sent nude photos to the male, did not testify and was not charged.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/manassas-city-teen-placed-on-probation-in-sexting-case-where-police-sought-photos/2014/08/01/c4d6ff62-19ad-11e4-85b6-c1451e622637_story.html?tid=a_inl&amp;utm_term=.5b1ae78b8bbe  It seems that if a girl does it, it's okay. I wish the girl had the book thrown at her so the mommy could see real justice be served - justice is supposed to be blind to gender, right?  If a teen girl was forced to masturbate for a bunch of cops (male or otherwise) this case would have garnered national attention and these guys would be in mortal danger and unemployed. Then the disgusting police department would get the heat it truly deserves and maybe these idiots/pervs would be replaced.  Edit: Just want to add for clarity that I honestly think this entire thing is fucked - just like most people in this comment section. Teens sexting consensually shouldn't be anyone's business but those involved (the teens). I personally wish the girl had been given the same treatment so the spotlight could burn a massive hole in the lives of the girl's mother, the police department, the officers involved, and the judges involved. (In a perfect world, the state would not be in any way involved in a sexting case between to mentally stable, consenting teens of similar age.) I get the sentiment but the girl was probably mortified and humiliated at school so the mom already screwed her some. I’m not comparing this to what happened to the guy his treatment was obviously worse but the girlfriend is equally as innocent in doing normal 15 year old things and having the “book thrown at her” would be just as much of a misstep in justice. The whole “sexting” craze from adults that was going on while I was in middle and high school is hopefully over for being the massive overreaction that it was.  I think he was 17 and she was 15, right?  I can't believe the kid got probation over this. This is the most trumped-up, ridiculous shit ever. We portray sexual relationships between teenagers every day - fuck, our literature that *we force kids to read* portrays sexual relationships between adults and children (see *The Crucible*). Some of the most popular porn categories involve teachers and students, schoolgirls, etc.   How the fuck are we going to be mad when teens wind up engaging in sexual behaviors with one another, and how the fuck are we going to impose a penalty a kid for sexting someone two years younger than him when we've all but encouraged these behaviors on an institutional and social level? Never call the cops. Yeah, that stood out to me too.  What the fuck?  Save the kids from engaging in consensual activities with persons of a similar age by having adults use and threaten violence to force them to commit sex acts. Simply taking a step back sheds a clear light on how fucked up the term "justice" is. Well put. &gt;Lawyers representing the Abbott estate argued that their client was shielded by "qualified immunity," the notion in American law that generally protects law enforcement officers in **gray-area** situations from legal liability  How the fuck is this a "gray area"?  Because it was a court order, which means the court found it to be lawful at the time.  But weren't the cops the ones who asked for the court order in the first place?  The American legal system is full of so many catch 22s I am beginning to think it's intentional. And how the hell does his estate/family keep fighting about this after everything that came out? You now KNOW he was a pedophile, why would you want to bring even more attention to thism Money talks, morality walks Everyone involved with, and with knowledge of, this entire fiasco should be looking for a new job.  I thought this was just an over-dramatic, sensationalized title. Then I read the article. Damn. That is messed up.  http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/08/health/students-grope-drug-sweep-trnd/index.html Wait what? Did I read that right? The cop who tried to force the teenager to masturbate in front of him and his buddies committed suicide because they were going to arrest him at a later date for pedophilia? pedo cop just wanted to see the kids dick ...  And the judge was like "as long as I get to see the video" another member of the [judical jackoff club](http://www.chron.com/news/nation-world/article/Judge-faces-charges-for-masturbating-during-trials-1945301.php) At what point was this kid allowed to be alone with these guys without a parent. Wouldn't they need to consent to this? The cops somehow got a warrant, which allowed them to force him to do this as a way to gather evidence.  The court here ruled that this warrant was unconstitutional. Regardless shouldn't the legal guardian have to be present of atleast able to see what's going on? Even when they asks kids about sexual abuse the parents or whoever are allowed or have legal reasoning to be there to see the questioning, or am I wrong?  ...and it takes a court of fucking law to FIGURE THIS SHIT OUT? &gt; "We cannot perceive any circumstance that would justify a police search requiring an individual to masturbate in the presence of others,"  and yet a judge approved and signed the warrant...that's how it works.  the cops make a request and a judge decides if it's legal, reasonable, and warranted...so where's the accountability for the judge?   It seems like judges are never held accountable.  two warrants, in fact. The judge who approved the warrants (there were two, keep in mind. He approved the one to make the kid perform for the officer and a second for the kid to be forcibly taken to the hospital for the shot.) should be disbarred, especially considering what came to light about the officer that wanted to watch the kid do it.  Good fucking riddance to that cop, but the judge needs to face the consequences of his actions as well. File this one under "No shit". Roses are red, justice is blind... ...Pedophile cop commits suicide after child pornography find. r/boottoobig Forcing a kid to masturbate or get a dick injection was found to be wrong, as in wasn't automatically fucking apparent? What the fuck [deleted] So..as long as you wear a badge it's ok to sexually abuse kids? What the actual fuck?   This country really needs to take a deep breath regarding sex. We've become neurotic and puritanical about it, and it's become a cudgel to be abused. Become? We've always been that way. How is the name of the Judge who signed that warrant not available information here? Even getting a warrant fr that act in the first place should be addressed. The judge is equally if not more at fault here than the police. My question as well. What kind of judge would sign this warrant? What is more fucked up in all these types of cases is that the law system allows a kid to be arrested for exchanging pictures of explicit nature with someone of the same age as himself.  The protection of child pornography is to protect kids against adults, not kids their own age. &gt; Abbott then obtained a second warrant authorizing police to escort Sims to a hospital for an "erection-inducing injection."  Our warrant system is fucking broken. Am I the only one pissed at the girls mom, too? Your teenage daughter was exhanging sexts, so instead of talking to them like adults as to why it's a terrible idea, you call the police and try to ruin the kid's life? What the fuck is wrong with people? &gt; That warrant was ostensibly part of an ongoing sexting investigation into the then-teen, Trey Sims, who had exchanged explicit messages with his then-15-year-old girlfriend. Her mother reported the incident to the Manassas City Police Department in January 2014.  Am I missing something? Why did the police even start investigating this? Two teens are in a relationship and send nasty messages. Mom doesn't like that and calls the fucking police??? On what ground did they not say "You stupid? We got better shit to do!"? Phew, glad that's settled! Coulda gone either way on that one.   I'm sorry, *what?* America: the developed country with third-world cops. Was that finding somehow ever in question? Jesus... “Many have expressed concern at what they believe to be an extreme measure in this type of case. However, when a criminal defendant, adult or juvenile, decides to exercise his or her right to a trial, it is necessary for the prosecution to explore all legal avenues of evidence collection in order to prepare for trial. While those legal avenues may be explored, they are not always pursued and are sometimes, as in this case, abandoned.”  This is a quote from the original story after the teen got sentenced to probation.  http://www.insidenova.com/headlines/manassas-teen-in-high-profile-sexting-case-gets-probation/article_87b32a7c-19f1-11e4-9e29-001a4bcf887a.html  what is crazy is that not one person brings up what if this was a female, would they go to this extreme measure for a female, highly doubtful.  My point would be, whoever suggested they get this guy to whip it out and get hard should be looked at, very hard, because as we all know, the people that bang the drum the loudest usually end up being involved with whatever they are rallying others to hate.   You’re right but It’s not doubtful, it’s factual.   The article said they had the girls phone too and since they took the pics on their own phone and sent them to each other’s phone they’d have identical content, but the article then states that she was neither brought it or charged.   The issue was that they were creating and distributing “child pornography” and in this scenario it takes two to tango so they’re both on legally equal footing.  And yet, she walks scott free and he became a pedo cops new toy.   Who we should be angry with is internal affairs, isn’t their whole existence to watch the watchers? So things like unreasonable and immoral requests aren’t made, then granted by warrant, then carried out, with no oversight?   If it’s 1 bad apple, it’s that persons fault, if every apple is bad, it’s managements fault.  Holding a child at gunpoint and forcing them to perform sexual acts should get you imprisoned for a very long time and put on a watchlist. How is this a question? Forcing anyone to masturbate is wrong. What year is it? I'm so glad this court finally cleared this question up. I was really on the fence for this one...... /s &gt; forcing kids to masturbate is wrong  Ya' think?  This story is bat shit crazy. Detective gets order to force teen to masturbate so he can compare with pic teen sent to his underage gf. Then detective gets busted for unrelated pedofilia charges and commits suicide. Basically this detective pursued this case just so he could get off. UFB. GLAD HE'S DEAD.  I had assumed this was going to be a /r/nottheonion sub. A.k.a. no shit Sherlock. Circle of obvious ignorance that nobody notices. Interesting.  wait they need a court of appeals to decide that WTF.  The one guy said it was okay should we look into that guy?  The courts just found that out? Oh wow, I knew that one right away, and I am sickened by the idea of it.  Feel like this should be from "The Onion." What fuckery logic makes that in any way okay? I read the title in Mr. Mackey's voice. Forcing kids to masturbate is wrong, mmkay? What the hell? How does the judge who originally okay-ed  not have their name plastered for all to see?  I think "the court finds" is the wrong term here.  It should be "the court *points out, with an irritated look on its face because the idea is so fucking obvious that even having to explain it to something is offensive to the very idea of human life on this planet*." A Court had to call that out... insane Yeah. Let’s just add that to the “No shit Sherlock” list you brain dead morons.  Is the onion leaking or is the world literally starting to crash and burn at a faster and faster pace I don't know what sort of ethics medics in the US have to adhere to in such situations, but here in the UK, if I was asked to do something like that, I would tell the police where to go. I have a feeling this would get 10 times the attention if the victim was a girl instead. This was a 2-1 case. In what way in this god-damned word is there 4th circuit court judge that thinks it's ok for cops to make an underage kid masturbate and in front of others and protect them under qualified immunity?  Not to mentioned a judge said to himself I'll sign a warrant so a cop can watch a boy masturbate. WTF.
 Without the video, this murderer would still be on the streets doing god knows what.  He gunned an unarmed man down who was literally running for his life.  We now know the man he shot knew the cop and knew his character.  Obviously he was running for a reason.  He felt he was going to die, and he did.     I think the WORSE part about this was that a jury still couldn't convict him. That's just embarrassing. One juror absolutely refused to convict, the rest were on the fence: https://www.today.com/news/walter-scott-shooting-jury-foreman-explains-how-michael-slager-case-t105742  The jury had one African American, the rest were white. I wonder why so many were undecided? The prosecutor even gave them other options besides murder to cover their bases.  &gt; Asked about why the lone juror refused to budge about a not guilty verdict, Montgomery would not elaborate.  &gt; “He just had his own convictions, and I’ll leave that right there,” he said.  Yeah, I wonder what those "convictions" were... Well, that's the power of jury nullification for ya, Reddit's own venerated legal concept. Disagree with a law or something? Refuse to convict, give no reason. Jurors can vote based on anything and do crazy shit and it is still upheld. If you want to get really crazy you should read [Tanner v. United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanner_v._United_States) where a verdict was upheld even thought a lot of the jury was fucked up the whole time.   &gt;After the defendant was found guilty of mail fraud, his attorneys filed several motions in which it was discovered that seven of the jurors drank alcohol during the noon recess. Four jurors consumed between them "a pitcher to three pitchers" of beer during various recesses.[1] Of the three other jurors who were alleged to have consumed alcohol, one stated that, on several occasions, he observed two jurors having one or two mixed drinks during the lunch recess, and one other juror, who was also the foreperson, having a liter of wine on each of three occasions. Juror Hardy also stated that he and three other jurors smoked marijuana quite regularly during the trial. Moreover, Hardy stated that, during the trial, he observed one juror ingest cocaine five times and another juror ingest cocaine two or three times. One juror sold a quarter pound of marijuana to another juror during the trial, and took marijuana, cocaine, and drug paraphernalia into the courthouse. One of the jurors described himself to Juror Hardy as "flying." And I'll continue to defend it.  A basic tenant of our system that's seemingly been forgotten is that it's better to have ten guilty people go free than one innocent person punished. What makes you think this was jury nullification?  It isn't necessarily, it just sounds like it- or rather, this is the safest form for JN to take and there's no way to tell. If you sit on guilty/not guilty and refuse to budge, especially if you don't give any real explanation, there's a good chance you're not open to logic/convincing and are basing your decision on something other than the law. Even if you don't convince the rest of the jury, your individual action is still effectively nullifying any potential guilty ruling (bar the judge declaring a mistrial/hung jury and sending the case to a different jury). Better man that I would have been.  If someone did that in the face of the video evidence we had, I'd call them right out on their "convictions" so the whole world knew. The same guy who stabilized the video made a documentary following the hype surrounding the video. [Frame 394](https://youtu.be/GZSb00oSzuY) Christ. He didn't warn, didn't pull his taser instead, didn't even try to make pursuit. What a psychopath. Agreed. His taser was supposedly knocked from his hand according to the documentary, but still doesn't justify shooting at someone 8 times. &gt; but still doesn't justify shooting at someone 8 times.  It's not the number of shots that is in question here....it's that he was shot in the back while running away.  Too often people focus on the number of shots.  That's a mistake.  It's very hard, arguably impossible, to override the fight-or-flight aspect of the brain when it comes to deadly force.  Now, before anyone downvote me based on cop-sympathizing......don't.  I'm pretty strictly critical of police-involved shootings.  It comes down to base-level brain function.When you get into a life or death situation...whether real or perceived.....the brain takes over.  You go into, for lack of a better term, a trance-like state.  The better trained you are...the better your actions can be mitigated...but when the metal hits the meat....you're on auto-pilot.  Whether Mr. Scott was shot 2 times or 15 times is basically irrelevant.  The relevant part is that he was shot in the back while running away.  That's where the training  &amp; intent matters.  Again...for the record, it is my opinion that Mr. Scott was executed....murdered.  So let there be no mistake on my feelings of this shooting. I still think he should've gotten at least 30 years.  The fact that Slager seems to have attempted to cover up what happened (placing his Taser next to the body) should have made this a life sentence.    We really need stronger deterrence against police coverups. What I find most disturbing in the video is how casually Slager picks up the Taser and moves it next to him. I mean, he didn't run over and check on him, or anything. I panic more than that when I spill a glass of water.   How endemic must this behavior be if you can be THAT casual about it? It's like he'd done it before. Casual indifference, that's the phrase that comes to mind about the murder of Scott. True. I'm shocked (though pleasantly surprised) that even this murderer is facing justice. Honestly I expected him to get the same treatment as the rest - fired, slap on the wrist, and a new job in a few weeks in the next county over.   I'm glad Slager will do time. Hopefully he meets some people inside who do not look kindly on murderous racists who put on a badge so they could bully people.  Yeah that was pretty terrifying honestly, like recently I've been delving into true crime stories and listening to some of the serial killer interviews from prison and BTK stuck out, he was just so fucking nonchalant and casual about tying these people up and choking them death like he was just having small talk about the weather or a sports game 19 years is a really long time. 19 years ago, I was in high school. My life has changed 5 times over since then and can’t imagine if I was in a cage that entire time. His life as he knows it is over and he might not even make it to see that 19th year.  Where's the video? I am new to the case. https://vimeo.com/124336782  It blows me away that his first *immediate* instinct was not to chase, but pull out his firearm and shoot the man. He didn't hesitate for even a moment before grabbing his gun. I feel like if someone makes a break for it, my immediate thought, after registering that they ran, would be to chase.  Lazy fuck would rather kill someone than run a few yards. He wasn't lazy, he was power tripping. It's clear from the video in how calm he is faking the evidence. He wanted to kill Walter Scott. It was just so blatant they couldn't fabricate the usual bullshit excuses - they had no outs on this so they had no choice but to let him face appropriate charges without the benefit of the prosecution deliberately throwing the case. Also the union seems quite a bit weaker in SC than in NY - the PBA guys will defend literally anything, no matter how heinous the circumstances or significant the evidence. Make no mistake, they had as much to do with many of the obscene exonerations as any other party involved. That’s right!  However, in the case of Eric Garner, that shit was also videotaped and went viral. I still don’t understand how those cops were exonerated.   I’m white, but I’m not stupid. The cops in that situation had no call to use such excessive force on that man. And then, when he told them he couldn’t breathe, they just let him die. Can't wait for the inevitable "But he was selling loose cigarrets and that's A͈̬̮̰͎̤͙̿͂̄̂͠͡ͅG̶̠̦̖̊ͧͭ̆̀Aͤͨͩ̋͏̛̜̭ͅI̛̖̖̗̦̻̤͐̐͌ͦ̀N̗̟̔̿͌ͮ͟͡S̯̫̺̙̥̊ͬ͋̉ͯ̓̔͢T̴̨͈̰̥̫̤͓̄̀ ͖͖ͩ̎̍͒͋T̡̠̻̥͍̣̱̐͠Hͥ̑̅̆ͩ́͞҉̯̹͓̞͖Ẽ̡̧̟͈ ̛͉̭̬̠̮͕̻̌̄͂͜L͕̮͍͔̒͢Ǎ̡͕̖̯̳͓̣̮̌̈́̑̉͗͡ͅW̛̻̗̼̼͇̱ͣ̌̌́."  As though so fucking minor an infraction as selling fucking cigarettes even warrants an immediate, forceful arrest. Fuck's sake. We're one of the most advanced nations in the world. Our cops should be tasked with having a *basic* sense of proportional response. You don't fucking need 4 (or was it more?) cops to take down a guy for selling god damn loose cigarettes. Yes, I know they were there because there was a fight and they were trying to get info about it out of him, but come the fuck on. Confiscate his cigarettes, give him a court date, and move the fuck on with your day. He wasn't even doing that at the time. He just had a previous ticket on his record for selling loose cigarettes but they somehow spun it into this bullshit. Could you imagine being brutally murdered by a cop for no good reason and then it being justified because you had a speeding ticket on your record from years prior?  (Is it snark time? I think it's snark time.)  I can indeed empathize with black people enough to imagine how horrible that experience would be. Bonus points if you're killed by that cop for *someone else's* warrant because you matched the description with your """broad nose""". This is where prejudice comes in to play, because selling loose cigarettes in the eyes of many seems like a "thuggish" thing to do. Just like with the hoodie for Trayvon, it seemed like a good play to diminish his character and make his death justifyable somehow. When I smoked, if you bum a cig, you best have a dollar bill. Yes because it's NYPD. They're basically a mercenary army to protect the value of all that real estate. Right! For God’s sake! Like the man was hurting somebody! Smoking kills.  Eric Garner was slowly murdering members of his own community. Why isn't anybody talking about the prevalence of selling loosies and other black-on-black violence! /s &gt; However, in the case of Eric Garner, that shit was also videotaped and went viral. I still don’t understand how those cops were exonerated.  Oh, I understand how it happened. Law and Order. The people are represented by two separate yet equally important groups; the police who investigate crime and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders.  Notice an absence of justice in there? The DA and the Police view themselves as being on the same team. They work closely together and they work for the same goal; conviction rates.  Even with that video, the DA can guide a grand jury either way.   The most egregious grand jury abuse I have seen involved those Georgia cops who disfigured a baby with a flashbang. Cops went before the grand jury and were cleared. Read their report. They felt they weren't tasked with criminal prosecution. They're job, as they understood it, was to make recommendations so that this sort of accident didn't happen again in the future. That's exactly what they did, they presented a big list of suggestions instead of prosecuting the animals that nearly killed a child. Seems disingenuous to compare a case where the cop was deliberately shooting someone to kill them vs a situation where there was absolutely no intent to kill anyone Well, ok, Garner obviously had health issues. I get that. But like the previous commentor stated- they used an unreasonable amount of force in this case. I don’t think that can even be argued. I’ve seen this video a few times and don’t even see how it got to the point the police felt they had to bring him down. They're both use of force. And they're both unjust uses of force. just so we're clear, you were in Pantaleos mind?   you know his intent for a fact or are you talking the officer's self-serving claim that he never wanted garner to die while he choked him to death?  and after choking him, the police then refused to perform medical assistance to help garner, while the intent is debatable the results are not. police killed this man through hate or incompetence but it was probably both. &gt;appropriate charges  He was charged with obstruction of justice and unlawful use of his weapon. He took a plea deal and plead guilty to deprivation of rights and had the obstruction (lying about fighting for his taser) and unlawful use of his weapon (literally killing Scott) charges dropped.  When he actually had "appropriate charges" i.e. the murder charge (second degree murder is defined as intentional murder with malice, but not premeditated. He didn't plan to kill Scott that day, but shooting a man who was running away who *actually* feared for his life? That's intentional. And the planting of the taser to make it seem like the shooting was necessary shows the malice because he's fabricating the scenario and then to lying to the police department), it resulted in a mistrial. Somehow the jury was deadlocked. As if [shooting an unarmed man in the back as he runs away](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/07/Shooting_of_Walter_Scott.jpeg) is such a confusing and complex situation where it's impossible to come to a conclusion. If there was video evidence of that and it *didn't* involve a cop, the judge and jury would have thrown 3 books at the shooter. [This is unconfirmed. It is not true. #MichaelSlager has not yet been sentenced. Those are just the guidelines the judge said he'd use. He also can sentence completely outside of them. #WalterScott] (https://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP/status/938804444669644800)  I mean, the judge is likely going to do what he said he was going to do... right? Well, I just got the update, and Slager was sentenced by the judge to 20 years.  So it seems the judge did just what they said they would do... He did!   Should have been way more in my opinion. Slager still gets out in time to be with his family, something Walter Scott's family can't do.  Oh, Michael Slager is definitely getting a reduced sentence for murder because he did it while wearing a cop's uniform. That is terrible, and that kind of thing must end.  Murder is murder, and cops ought to be held to a higher standard, not a lower one. Correction issued.  [CORRECTION: Former South Carolina police officer Michael Slager faces 19 to 24 years in prison for shooting death of Walter Scott.] (https://twitter.com/ABC/status/938805791863304192)  [Judge sentences Michael Slager to 20 years.](http://abcnews.go.com/US/cop-michael-slager-faces-19-24-years-prison/story?id=51595376)    Any bets on when he actually gets out? I'm guessing some time before 2037. &gt; the PBA guys will defend literally anything, no matter how heinous the circumstances or significant the evidence  Didn't they throw that one young rookie under the bus? Never forget that before the footage got out Reddit was all in saying how the cop was justified in shooting him. i dont remember that.  I remember people saying they were hoping it wasnt another travesty.  what subreddits do you hang out on? r/protectandserve was all over defending this guy, though they'll defend anyone with a badge regardless of how guilty, so I guess they don't really count. Just checked out that sub now, looking for their reaction to Slager's sentence.  Currently, it seems as they are also disgusted by Slager's behavior and thought a guilty verdict was correct. They may have been defending him before the footage, and been wrong then, but currently, they seem to be against him, along with every reasonable person who's seen the footage matched up with the police scanner. Of course they will. They defend any scum who puts on a uniform that should remind them of the higher standards they should be subject to for wanting to put on that uniform.  Reddit is full of bias. Those twerps are especially nasty, but not unique. &gt; Reddit was all in saying   Any time I see someone assert "reddit" did a thing or said a thing or supported a thing or protested a thing, I safely ignore that comment, because "reddit" is not a single individual with opinions.   If we used your logic on you, well, you're a transsexual, a racist, a furry, a politician, Bill Nye the Sex Junk Guy, EA, and Net Neutrality.  Because I've seen all those things on reddit, so that's what you must be, I guess. Actually I'm a Black man over 40 yrs old so I'm VERY DIFFERENT from the hive mind types that come here.  I also don't ever come to Reddit for news because I also saw how much this place fucked up when it came to the Boston bombers. If people come here for news and commentary, they'll eventually internalize these ideas into their beliefs. It may not be intentional, and you may even have a discerning eye for bullshit, but the hive mind does have an impact on people. Just curious, I argued recently that "cops" aren't a thing.  Officers are just people with similar training and job descriptions.  Their beliefs, abilities and levels of competence vary by the individual.  I was lambasted, of course.  So after reading your comment about Reddit...can you agree that this also applies to "cops"? Absolutely. You and I would likely agree on a lot, given that. &gt;Reddit was all in saying  Cause you're the only individual here and the rest of us are some kind of borg entity.  I already forgot so I could use a refresher.  Please cite a thread from a major sub where this happened.  Thanks.   Wow I'm pleasantly surprised. We actually have a semblance of justice. He hasn't been sentenced yet, these are just guidelines.  just an fyi, I don't know when it got updated, but it now says he was sentenced to 20 years, of the possible 19-24 He was sentenced to 20 years.   https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/07/us/michael-slager-sentence-walter-scott.html  He was facing life. Oh okay. I was confused by the headline. My apologies - it's my first submission to /r/news, and when the article appeared, it definitely said "sentenced to 19-24 years."  ABC News has since edited the headline to the more correct, "...faces 19-24 years."  I thought the sentence had been determined, which I thought was news-worthy.  I guess we'll see what Mr. Slager actually gets sentenced to soon... 25 years for blatant murder seems a bit light.  I thought that was the standard. Even considered harsh by other nations standards, not that I agree 25 years is pretty much what you get de facto in most Western countries for "regular" murders.  Things get iffy because the US considers a lot of homicides "murder" (usually second degree) that would usually result in some form of manslaughter pretty much anywhere else. No felony-murder-rule either. 20 years for civil rights violations (federal). That's not a bad day for justice. 20 years is the max sentence in Texas for some murders.  &gt; 20 years is the max sentence in Texas for some murders.   Which murders are those? Most people that commit **murder** in Texas and are convicted get the needle.  It was pursuant to a plea agreement. He faced life. Yea, but still a *semblance* of justice. I was expecting him to get &lt; 5. It wasn't premeditated. At least no evidence of it That's due to a plea deal.  His max would have been life imprisonment  I think 20 years is still too short, but I'll take what we can get. He was allowed to plead guilty to violating Scott's civil rights. He should have been made to stand trial for murder.  He did stand trial for murder. One dumbass juror refused to convict, so it was a mistrial (11-1). I know, but another trial was scheduled but he was allowed to plead before it started.  Keep in mind folks that this case resulted in a hung jury. Clear video evidence. Clear attempt at a cover up. Still resulted in a jury going "hmmm maybe he didn't commit murder.".  It is a small victory that he's being sentenced to 20 years after a guilty plea which dropped a couple of other charges against him, but it's also a reminder that EVEN WHEN there is clear, indisputable evidence AND a cover-up, police still will not be convicted by their peers.  RIP Walter Scott. Fun fact: in Dutch his surname, that being 'Slager',  *actually* means **butcher**.  Fitting... Go read the comments on this mistrial from a year ago if you wanna laugh at people who are clueless about our justice system. All the officers who tried to help fabricate a cover story need to be in prison with Slager. [deleted] Well, I suppose it's that it was recorded on video, which went viral, and seemed to clearly show Walter Scott running away from the officer, and get shot several times directly in the back.  The context of the video showed that Walter Scott was no threat at all, running very weakly away.  Scott's death-penalty offense?  Broken tail light.  The real difference is that officer Slager was fired, and is now sentenced to 19-24 years in prison.  That seems rare for police (to actually be convicted). &gt; Well, I suppose it's that it was recorded on video, which went viral, and seemed to clearly show Walter Scott running away from the officer, and get shot several times directly in the back.  It also showed the cop moving the Tazer next to Scott's body. Being caught staging the scene to match his description (Scott grabbed his Tazer, so he fired in self-defense) cast everything the cop said in a very poor light and everything snowballed from there. Keep in mind they *still* couldn't get a state court conviction on this; the first trial ended in a mistrial and the retrial was pending until he pleaded guilty to the federal charges. The state, apparently, is not pursuing its case further. All because *one* asshole juror refused to convict. 11-1. That person probably never votes to convict a cop. pretty sure the juror admitted that he'd never vote to convict a police officer Never should have been on the jury. Disgraceful. It was simply so blatant, and the entire incident was recorded. People often look for any excuse to defend the police, but there simply wasn't one in this case. Castile is as blatant as it gets in my eyes. This case was equally as blatant. But he was reaching for his gun! ...after calmly telling the officer he had a CC weapon in his car...and after the officer asked for his info. I think you forgot to put a "/s" at the end... One juror found an excuse of some sort at the mistrial. Someone up thread is trying. Just watch the video.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ynoi3KE-ODw Better quality video [on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/124336782) This needs to get pushed all the way up. Accountability has to be made widespread and see what a working system looks like. Scott's family also received $6.5 million in a civil settlement from the City of North Charleston.  At least some justice came out of this tragic event. Money can't bring him back to life. They should have used civil forfeiture to seize **criminal** Slager's possessions and money to subsidize the payment. Additionally his retirement account should have been drained for this. I don't know, doing something like that seems super fucked up /s I get that money doesn't hurt the family further, but neither will it do anything to return the life of Walter Scott.  My father died in 2013, and if someone gave me $6.5 million and said I could have him back for even a few moments in exchange, I wouldn't hesitate for a second.  Finding meaning in this crazy world is hard enough, and relationships with other people are the closest thing I've ever found... Get money from the taxpayers that were probably just as appalled as the rest of us..... Every time I see the "at that expense of the taxpayers" on police shooting settlements I always respond with "Good." Maybe once enough of your tax money goes towards unfucking the wrongdoings of the police, taxpayers will be a bit more proactive about voting for politicians who enable it. Finally, some fucking justice in this racist ass country.  "I feared for my life when the man ran in the completely opposite direction!"  Get fucked scumbag. With clear video evidence... You’re a cop: 20 years  Anyone else: life  were it your average human being committing murder, the sentence would be life without parole.   Still a 2 tier justice system. &gt; were it your average human being committing murder, the sentence would be life without parole.  ... you sure? never heard of anyone committing murder and not getting life in prison? This is evidence that we need to deport right wing racist cops.   If this racist cop wasn’t in this country, this poor victim would sill be alive. It’s shameful that the flyover state shitholes have become sanctuary cities for racist murderous cops.  Thank you to the person who recorded that murder.   Otherwise, the murderer would still be in uniform, still committing crimes against citizens.    Even with it being super cut and dry I wonder how pissed people on r/protectandserve are There's no mention of it whatsoever. It's the top thread right now and it was posted immediately after the actual sentence was handed out.  I just clicked on the thread link and the top comment is "Good, He got lucky that he only got 20. Deserves life."  I don't know if it was an LEO posting that though so take from that what you will.  That doesn't really fit with the circlejerk though.  I am Jacks complete lack of surprise.  Good, finally some sort of Justice. It is rather refreshing to see a lying, dirty, (ex)cop get his due. Too bad the other cops that kill unarmed people are given a free pass, and keep their jobs. Let this be a lesson to the cops who willfully commits misconduct throughout this nation. This garbage cop should have gotten the death sentence.  Garbage committed a crime, try to cover it up, all while being a public servant who the citizen of this could try put trust on him.  But this is better than him walking free though. Maybe this cop grew up watching too many black and white movies. It's almost comical in old cinema where a cop's first reaction to a fleeing suspect is to draw his gun and unleash a hail of bullets, and it really doesn't matter how insignificant the suspected crime is, either.  I have no idea who you are, but you saw me and started to run?  Stop in the name of the law! *bang bang bang* Acutal justice.  Holy shit [Worth a look.](https://www.shortoftheweek.com/2016/05/14/frame-394/) I watched this a while ago and it really changed how I view this case. It definitely is worth a look Cop fucked up. Usually these guys just get suspended with pay. Another trump pardon? Wasn't federal so no. Dear god. Anyone else that's not a cop would've gotten life without parole. I would like to assume that if there was no video, he wouldve still gotten sentenced. I mean, they wouldve noticed he was shot in the back from 20ft right after looking at the wounds? First trial was a hung jury lol even with the video I heard it was 1 person who refused to convict outright  [deleted] In the back 5 times That's correct. Probably someone who has cop family members. I'm convinced he was the ringer cherry-picked by the DA's office. Multiple gunshot wounds to the back.  Worst case of suicide the coroner's ever seen.  Real shame, it is. Open and shut case Johnson. Just sprinkle some crack on him. No. https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2012/08/20/159416070/death-of-handcuffed-man-in-police-car-ruled-a-suicide  Handcuffed. Searched twice.  Suicide. Well, if we're the police then who will police the police? Ionno. Coastguard? This guy gets it ^ Honestly I doubt it. I think the falsified police report and video is what did it.  &gt; the falsified police report  Tangential, *but* keep this case in mind when you're looking up stats on police killings. Most of these stats are based on police self-reports. When a killing is reported as "justified" think about what happened to Walter Scott. Nope. In the 3 days before the video was released a *whopping* 3 newspapers (all local charleston papers) reported on the story and ALL of them just copied the police report verbatim in their retelling of the story. No no it's 5 warning shots in the back /s lol. you know how common it is for these things to be covered up and give a slap on the wrist? I'm actually surprised that even with the video anything happened. That's good news. You mean, when they find the body covered in pistols and cocaine, and a Koran and some kiddie porn? Yeah, they probably would have figured it out.  &gt;I would like to assume that if there was no video, he wouldve still gotten sentenced.   You assume wrong. Slager immediately tried to plant his taser near Scott's downed body. With no video his bullshit account would have probably been enough to say it was a clean shoot.  Even an exact record doesn't always help. There was an audio of the Kelly Thomas murder. Look it up if you think you can stomach it. [I wouldn't count on it.](http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article188145129.html)   I think that a lot of white peoples' eyes are being opened up as to how police really operate.  And from your extremely optimistic and somewhat naive comment, I can tell you're white. White and black doesn't matter for the article. What does matter is that clear picture of Walter Scott running away and Michael SLager shooting him in the back when Walter Scott doesn't present a danger to another person.  Now that this one is done can we please get Mohammed Noor on trial?  &gt; Now that this one is done can we please get Mohammed Noor on trial?  All this time and I don't think they've even taken a fucking statement from this guy. Disgraceful.  The police union is still probably working with their lawyers testing legal theories on mock juries to see what will seem most believable to avoid a murder charge. And over at r/protectandserve , utter silence. I just submitted the link there.  Perhaps it will stimulate discussion. Damn, murdered because of back child support. I generally don't support the death penalty but it is warranted in this case. Shame he will be in protective custody.  Proud of my home state for this. Other places have obfuscated and protected bad cops but SC did what was right. Lol bullshit. This is a federal trial that just convicted him, because your state had a hung jury over the original murder charge. Nothing to be proud of that the feds had to step in and do your job for you  He was immediately charged and not some BS paid leave during internal investigation that gets flushed down the collective memory hole. The jury was hung with 11 of 12 voting to convict, while 12th wanted a different charge. Plus there was a retrial scheduled. The feds just got there first because the retrial didn't happen yet.   People just see SC IS A REDSTATE!!! THEY'RE ALL SISTERFUCKING RACISTS!!! meanwhile you have California and Maryland and a lot of other "progressive" places letting cops walk on similar charges. Get off your high horse.   Looks like he just got sentenced to 20 years by the judge... Still wasn't set free like so many bad cops are.   Edit: apparently he plead guilty so there was no trial and the judge assigned a punishment. It's terrifying what police have gotten away with before the proliferation of smartphones.  This is Steve Jobs' true legacy. Weird, they actually sent a white cop to jail for killing an unarmed black man.  Granted, it was for less time than he deserves, but it is something. "The judge's decision comes after Slager, who is white" This obviously had to be mentioned..... Either fuck this guy, have fun being an ex cop in jail [deleted] We still have it in some states Scott's mom thanks Jesus a lot...but Jesus probably could have been a little more proactive here.
 &gt;Starnes says the father isn’t facing charges and that he “really saved the day and protected a lot of people.”  I love a happy ending.  This is why asian massage parlors are so popular. Lot of shooting going on? Something certainly gets shot, a load of it you could say. Face it you had to see this joke cumming. You used too many puns, you jerkoff! turn over prease. This is a happy ending, but let's all be real here: the father is pretty damn lucky.  Instead of making the safe move and just handing over money and having the gunman leave, he risked his and everyone else's life by making a stand.  Had the gunman reacted to the father pulling a weapon and he started panic firing, innocent people could have been killed over whatever small sum of money he had on him.  The father himself could have missed and shot someone else in the melee of two people shooting at each other.  Fortunately this time ended well, and we all love to see a violent criminal scumbag eat a bullet, but honestly just handing over the money would have been a lot safer for everyone involved.    There's no guarantee the guy wouldn't have shot him after he handed him the money, either. There's plenty of cases where after the guy gets the cash he just shoots the victim. Sometimes they shoot you first then take it. People think a murder charge is a deterrent. It isn't   What you do know is this guy has a gun and is committing a felony against you with it. He can shoot and kill you. He's using the threat of lethal force to get you to do something. That's what you should base your actions in the moment on, rather than gamble on 'maybe he won't'  You can what if all day, what if after he'd gotten the money dude wants more and thinks someone is holding out on them and gets violent anyways.  I know this is reddit but if you're going to armchair analyze do yourself a favor and try not to talk like you know what you're talking about. Not sure why the down votes.  A general rule is *don't draw on a pointed weapon*.  I agree, the safer play would have been compliance.  Maybe he saw an opening and seized it.  I'm glad it worked out for this good guy with a gun this time though.  Could have easily gone south. True, but you are forgetting the deterrence value. The next would-be armed robber will think twice. I doubt the future deterrence value played much into this guys decision making process in the moment.  I suppose.  But really, someone dumb or desperate enough to do such a stupid crime probably isn't considering many factors like that. There are any number of robberies in which the victim complies with the robber's demand and is shot anyway. Robbers are rational actors, but their reasoning stems from a basic premise that other human lives have no value. All wild conjecture. If we are thinking on things that could have happened then I say the father acted perfectly, had he done nothing the bad guy would have killed everyone present to eliminate all witnesses.   &gt;he risked his and everyone else's life by making a stand.  No, the criminal did that when he decided to victimize innocent people.   &gt; Instead of making the safe move and just handing over money  You mean the move that gets people killed all the time? Ask the multiple gas station clerks with holes in their heads how often just handing the money over works.   Everything you have said revolves around multiple failures that just plain didn't happen, the man reacted in the moment and executed perfectly, full stop. You can comply and change your mind after if the circumstances change.  Always look for an opening.  Sounds like this guy saw and seized his opening before he had to comply. &gt;The gunman demanded money and, when the father refused, the gunman turned his weapon toward the man’s family. At that point, the father, who is licensed to carry a firearm, pulled out his own gun and fired.    Came for the plata, got the plomo. Orale pues Yo quiero Taco Bell Vino para la silver, recibió el lead . How dumb do you have to be to threaten people with a gun in Texas? Like aren't a shit load of people packing? Gun-toting Texas is kind of an outdated stereotype. Only about 5% of adult Texans are licensed to carry, which is about average for the country and well under some other states like Florida, Washington, and Tennessee. People who think Texas is all gun-nut rednecks haven't visited recently to see what a melting pot it's become over the years. I worked in texas and it may feel like  alot more than 5% but then you realize how fucking big Texas is.   Now living in Florida...... so many people are packing. That's because Floridaman is a big threat down there. as is tradition Hmm. Worked in Florida. Everyone on my team had guns (6 people). Worked in Houston the next summer. Everyone in my team there also had guns (5 people).  The twist, you work for a swat team.    Seriously though, what do you do where 100% of a team carries guns on the job?  I work on a base, lots of people with guns; LOE only though, in the hospital itself, all weapons are prohibited except LOE, so it's weird to me.  Also, would be weird if every other programmer on my team had a CC.   Edit: there are a couple people that take some serious chances.  One guy regularly carries a machete, and another has a couple guns in his truck.  I don't think either of these are kosher for contractors to be carrying on base, but at least they don't bring them in the building.  If they get spot checked at the gates, they could be in some serious trouble, or at least a bit.  Could lose their CAC. They weren't allowed to have guns on the job, but they all owned multiple guns. I worked at Kennedy space center and Johnson space center ! Though everyone on both teams were fairly close knit, so I'm assuming the one gun enthusiast that was there got everyone else into it. Are you a police officer?  Haha, an engineer ! If I lived in Texas, I definitely would go for the concealed carry license, just because I can.    I've only seen maybe 3 people open carry since the law past https://www.gunstocarry.com/concealed-carry-statistics/  I mean the stereotype that everyone has a gun in texas is kinda dying. Not saying a lot don't have it, but plenty of other states are more Pro 2A than texas. Really fucking dumb and they're everywhere.  Am also Texan and can confirm.  Confused by the other comments saying it's just a stereotype and not true.  I'm in Austin, the city one is probably least likely to see guns in public in, and I see people with them holstered regularly.    There are 5 people in my department, two conceal and carry.  Score one for us responsible gun owners. Responsibility! Only use said gun when needed.  This is a good one for /r/dgu  I’m not sure you want to keep score... [deleted] Not quite what you'd call a 'responsible' one, though. I think it's a net zero sum, given the fact that a guy with a gun was threatening a family in a restaurant.  And if he came in the restaurant with a machete or a knife, are we supposed to have hoped that somebody else was carrying a samurai sword or a katana? Challenge him to an honorable duel to the death then attack him with dual steak knives from the kitchen duh A restaurants steak knives are rarely sharper then the butter knives  I work in a pizza place so my experience with steak knives is about 0 That would be worse, dull knives tear rather than cut. That'd be a nasty wound. I got a WWI pioneer bayonet. It's 24" long with a saw on the back. That's a nasty wound.  &gt; And if he came in the restaurant with a machete or a knife, are we supposed to have hoped that somebody else was carrying a samurai sword or a katana?  Long blades and martial arts weapons in general are felony caries in most states and cities. You can get a concealed gun permit, but good luck getting a permit to carry your Katana. legal in texas, i think. Correct, you can open carry blades, including swords in Texas. Just don't walk around with a pair of chucks or a tonfa  Edit to add......have been closely associated with arrests for chucks in SA TX from a front yard. You local regulations may vary. how about collapsible batons? Usually also illegal and classified as bludgeons, even in more permissive states.  Again check your local laws. KickAss 3:Texas Justice??? Yes..it just passed recently All those years studying the blade for nothing. :( the life of the blade choose you. You dont choose it It was a fast food restaurant, not a Beni Hana, so no problem there. Oh sure, just completely discount the awesomeness of spork fights. Not at all, there was only one responsible gun owner there and *he dun gud*. A gun just saved a families life.  Guns don't save people. People save people.  Toasters don't toast toast, toast toasts toast Right, toasters toast bread. Unless you want darker toast, and end up re-toasting your toast in the toaster. Aha! Here's the problem, too many toasters! You've just solved the toaster-control issue! Someone elect this man! &gt; Guns don't save people. People save people.   I love this phrase. Man with gun vs Man with out gun. Man with gun wins.  Just broke your dumb logic. Man with gun vs gun without man.  Man with gun still wins. Man now has TWO guns. When will the madness stop? https://youtu.be/seH3bsymNJ4?t=7 I know you're gunna get props from the super pro gun crowd there, but setting up a scenario like that is unrealistic to begin with.  You can't predict how scenarios/crimes are going to play out, but yes, on paper, you don't bring fists to a gun fight.  I could care less about internet points. But yea big supporter of bearing arms. I'm glad it went well, it could have very easily went wrong, the robber could have shot the father when he realize he was moving..  thank god for well trained gun owner.  From a gun, sure.  Surprised to see a pro-gun article in /r/news that isn't heavily downvoted despite the best possible outcome having occurred. Well, this and the concealed carry reciprocity article.  https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7i39s5/house_passes_concealed_carry_reciprocity_act/  Edit: Which seems to have mysteriously disappeared without being deleted. Yep, quite awhile ago.  It was on the front page of r/news and then... poof.  The majority of the comments were in support of it so I guess that's why it had to go bye bye.   Waiting for this one to follow the same fate... It's was just a press release from the NRA, so it got taken off the front page for "Analysis/Opinion". I'm surprised it stayed up as long as it did. Isn't it weird how rational people support people who do rational things?  Maybe those gunmen who shoot up churches and schools deserve an angry mob?  Butttt thats just me. that isn't what he's talking about. lmao is there some other r/news that im not aware of? this sub is massively pro gun  There was a ccw reciprocity story earlier that disappeared quick. I just noticed that. Really, reddit?  [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7i39s5/house_passes_concealed_carry_reciprocity_act/) for anyone that didn't see it before it was disappeared. The mods don't want the NRA getting traffic Someone moved it to the opinion section.  Really fucking crafty if you ask me Well, a story about a bill passing the house is obviously not actually news, it's just an opinion that it happened...or something...  /s If a story is about Amazon buying Whole Foods and it is written by AP, then it is news.  If it is a story about Amazon buying Whole foods and it is from the Amazon web site, it isn't news; it is PR.  Why would you think that the NRA is a news source? You say that like it's a bad thing. /r/politics in out in force.  They're salty over Al Franken. 30 Democrat senators demanded Franken's resignation. Who exactly do you think is salty and why? Doubt it, probably salty Moore hasn't been removed yet, least the Dems cleaned out the trash. Moore will win, GOP will force him to resign and appoint Strange... The guy Trump originally supported in the primaries.   I'll bet a months pay, that Moore will not be forced out. He will happily finish his term.  Is that how it works? Would it be an appointment by the governor or a special election? What makes you say that. Way to many people still support him. Support gets you elected, but it can't keep you in office if you get impeached.   I think they have to run a special elections. They don't have the stones to remove him. Yeah that thread has dissolved into a shitshow really fast. One of my comments was sitting at around -7 the past 2 hours.  It jumped to -50 the next time I checked.  All I did was link to a list of some 20 prominent republicans denouncing Roy Moore in reaction to a statement Franken made that said he had the full support of all republicans.   Holy hell, they descended upon that thread and destroyed it.  Dissolved in to one? That sub reddit has been one for a long time. What are you talking about, I see fatal DGUs on /r/news all the fucking time, and in every single gun related thread here that's not a mass shooting, anything remotely pro gun control gets downvoted to fucking oblivion.      Hell I can think of four examples to make it to /r/News in the past month alone, and I'm sure there were more.       4*12 = 48 on average a year, and there are only about 250 justified homicides a year in the country.       If you commit a justified homicide in the US you literally have a +20% chance of making it to /r/News. That's a pretty fucking massive bias for pushing stories like this to the top. If 18% of murders made it to /r/News we'd see over 6 articles about murder a day here.  Not all dgu are legally called justifiable homicide in crime stats. It's a recording issue.   Many are seen by police and da as justified, the person is never charged, etc... But it doesn't make the official stats. Sounds like a concealed firearm owner acting responsibly and appropriately to save lives.   Good riddance! To paraphrase Homer Simpson: "To guns! The cause of, and solution to, all of life's problems"  Guns are the real life Pandora's box. Unless the aliens come and poof away every gun ever created while simultaneously disappearing all documentation and knowledge on how to make them, they are a necessity. man, i can't wait for HBO's gunpowder.  Just realizing how much a fuckin gun changed the world is pretty damn fascinating.  What's that? Show about the history of guns? That sounds interesting as hell. it's a new show coming out on HBO.   It looks like Game of Thrones 2, except without all the fantasy.   Takes place in 1603, about an Englishmen on a quest for gunpowder to overthrow a king.  'what's a mob to a king, what's a king to a **GUN.**' I think we should supply every American with a harpoon Someone's been watching too much TTT I don't recall Gandalf wielding a harpoon. A poon is an istant sign of Lewis Never thought id see the yogacats referenced in here Same. I know the JingleJam for 2017 is off to a great start, but of all the threads.  A poon-off would be entertaining. The NFL Superpoon 2017 is this your way of saying America is too fat? Not fat, just good at floating  Or a netgun  I want a trident... no, a slingshot with mini hand grenades Give every American a gun with one bullet. I think we should supply every ninja with a blowgun It's nice to see the good guy with a gun get some time on /r/news. Quick reminder to everyone that defensive gun uses like this one happen every day in the US. Some but not all of those stories are covered over at /r/dgu If only chris Murphy could see this. Talk about shattering beliefs. LUL Is he against guns? Yup. He thinks its absurd that a good guy with a gun can stop a bad guy with one, so ban them so no criminals can get guns. 10/10 logic Since, you know, every bad guy gets his gun legally through all the proper channels.  Likely with a comment like that I figured. I should have been more specific. I meant is he against concealed carry / 2nd amendment rights / that sort of thing.  Yes. Extremely. I’ll edit with links about all of his gun control measures.   Edit:   Here is one [example](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/07/chris-murphy-senator-gun-control-las-vegas-sandy-hook)  that gives an overarching view on what he’s done to try and pass gun control measures.   Here is a [Hartford Courant Article](https://www.google.com/amp/www.courant.com/politics/hc-pol-murphy-guns-fact-check-20171017-story,amp.html) about how misguided he is about firearms, specifically “assault weapons”  Basically, him and Dick Blumenthal suck, but people listen to them anyways because they have the emotional support of the people after Sandy Hook.  I like to think that he pulled out his gun and shot him faster than the robber could react, I like to imagine him wearing a hat too, the whole Clint Eastwood outfit. And he was smoking a cig while eating. Also the good the bad and the ugly soundtrack playing in the background, and he didnt flinch when he shot him, then he sat down and continued eating.  “Do you feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk?” And also they weren't in a restaurant or eating, they were staring each other down in the middle of the street. The fact that you turned the entire thing into a juvenile power fantasy sums up why America is in it's current state. I thought this sort of thing has been proven never to happen! What? Of course they happen, we've known they do. There are just under 250 justified homicides a year.  no one says this  You're being downvoted, but correct. u/U5efull gave a [straw man argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man).  The actual argument is about costs and benefits. Do the benefits, like events where a good guy shoots a bad guy (e.g. this thread's article), outweigh the costs, like events were a bad guy shoots a good guy (e.g. [Las Vegas shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Las_Vegas_shooting)). If that really is what the argument is about (and I don't feel that's the case), the answer by the numbers is definitely yes. [Even by the most pessimistic estimates](http://www.vpc.org/studies/justifiable17.pdf) (note the very anti-gun tone of the text in general), defensive gun uses outnumber gun homicides 9:1.  While most defensive gun uses don't involve the gun being fired or the bad guy being killed (so we're not comparing "bad deaths" to "good deaths" or anything like that), I'm satisfied with the potential number of lives saved per year. I just refreshed this page to see how the upvote count changes.  It goes up a few then down a few, then up a few and down.  I think people are downvoting because they can't stand to see a self defense gun story where the good guy with the gun saves the day.  Not good for the narrative.  Interesting that the other stories on the "new" page the same amount of time have  five, 21, and thirty upvotes, much less than this. I don't know how Reddit's upvote algorithm works, but maybe this one will go to the controversial section since obviously some people keep downvoting it.  But yes, that is interesting, I agree. A couple of weeks ago, I noticed a story about a woman shooting an intruder was near the top of the "Hot" news for over 24 hours, it was really nothing more than a local story. I've seen several gun defense stories getting what seems like way more upvotes than any other report that would be considered just a "Local Interest" story. That's not what's happening, or more accurately, that is not evidence that it is happening, reddit does that to everything that is voted on.  Edit: Reddit meaning the site itself not the users of the site as a whole. It is like a gunfight with votes.  Bam bam!  Bam!  Click!  Damnit, I'm out of upvotes!  I need a spare mag ASAFP!  I imagine this was a Waffle House, and everyone nonchalantly sat back down and finished their breakfast while the robber bled out.  ....thats because of waffles, theres an unspoken bond between man and waffle. Don't get between and man and is nom noms. Im gonna come back here in an hour or 2 to see what has transpired  Fascinating, keep us updated. My bet is on it disappearing like the reciprocity thread.  Threadlock, most likely. Not yet  So the father just murdered a man with his *gun*? That's all I read, why did he have to shoot him? The father needs to be held for murder. Prayers for the victim, the could have just told him to stop and leave.      /s Downvote cannons were locked on and armed, but stood down from red alert upon receiving Condition "/s" Many of my sarcastic people remain in oblivion for forgetting to wear their '/s' modifiers. Why didn't he just shoot him in the leg?  /s Clearly, the father needed to dialouge with this individual to better understand his grievances   obligatory /s I just hope the guy isn't suffering about killing a man or his family just witnessing it "Starnes says the father isn’t facing charges"  This seems to go without saying, doesn't it?  He had the gun legally, along with a Carry permit.  If this isn't a textbook example of self-defense, I have no idea what would be. This guy needs a metal stat! This was a really dumb move by the father and he is extremely lucky. I am a gun owner, so not anti-gun. If someone is trying to rob you at gun point, just give them the money even if you have a gun. This situation could have been way worse.  The problem is, as I noted earlier, that you can give up the money and get a bullet in return. Its possible but unlikely in such a circumstance, you would just be driving up the charges against you and the pressure to find and catch you. Its not like you rob a restaurant expecting to kill all witnesses. Thats why the advice is usually, give the asshole what he wants and live to see another day. Like the first thing they taught me in my self defense class was don't try to fight your way out of such situations unless its a really last resort. They will remind you of that every time they teach you something like kicking things out of a hand or something. I'd much rather hand over my money than risk a shoot-out around my family.   &gt;I'd much rather hand over my money than risk a shoot-out around my family.  You're assuming the assailant (who is unstable and illogical enough to threaten violence with a gun over pocket change) will think and reason like you. There's no reason why you complying will result in them leaving you unharmed. Google the Brown's Chicken Massarcre... everyone complied, everyone was executed.  If someone threaten's my life or the life of my loved one, I will take the first available opportunity to stop the threat. Violent criminals committing armed robbery are not compassionate. Can I ask what your home address is and what times you, your significant other (if you have any), and any children or roommates work or have class?  For research of course. *Hands over money to avoid confrontation*  *Gets shot anyway* What happens when the guy wants to rape your wife or your kids? You just hand them over too? It's not like you have a choice. Life is full of ifs.
 You know what's weird? My FB feed has been constantly populated with (admittedly pro) posts about the issue for the last few months, but now it's actually a thing, nothing. Not a word. I think how it was organised was all just a bit weird, isn't it? The celebration was when the vote came out, this like the nirty gritty paperwork to make it official. This part should be irrelevant. With so much hullabaloo about whether it was legally binding etc, you'd think there'd be celebration for the rubber stamp too. Technically it's not legal quite yet, it has to get signed off by the GG. I think for a lot of people (In particular those who are gay/bi) they're kind of still at a stage where it hasn't quite sunk in yet.  Given the result of the survey blocking the bill would have been political suicide. As much as you can argue it wasn't legally required there's no way in hell the government could let it be an issue at the next election if they wanted to be re-elected. The GG certifying it is good as done. They don't interfere in this, and if he did we would soon be a republic too.  Its a ceremonial formality that's part of the legal system. Even in the UK, laws are not technically laws until the Queen signs off on them - Royal assent. I think pretty much everywhere in the world, once a parliament/congress/legislative body approves a bill, it gets sent to someone else, generally the head of state, for a formal signing into Law.   Dude the GG literally staged a coup against the government in 1975 and they couldn't even pass the republic referendum after that debacle. There are probably a whole heap of reluctant guys who have just run out of excuses for not marrying their other half. And then there needs to be the 28 day intention to marry period. So the 9th of January for about a week then most people will stop caring and it will not news anymore   My facebook feed has been filled with celebrations all night Wouldn't it be hilarious if the Queen said "LOLI'm gonna totally fuck with those bogans down under" and withheld royal assent. Wait till January 9th. That’s when the weddings start (two workmates left early to go register) Wasn't the not-referendum a few weeks ago? I guess it makes sense to preach more about an issue when you can potentially influence the outcome. That's what happened here in the US, too. Before legalization = bedlam, chaos, riots! People marrying animals and inanimate objects and hellfire and damnation! Someone please think of the children!   The next day... crickets. All fucks ceased to be given.  It's all over American facebook feeds that's why. We're hogging it all. The general public aren't educated in how the "vote" actually worked. It was literally a survey, however they thought it was the final say.  In this case, on this scale, I'd call it more of a "statement of public will". There's no way the government *wouldn't* comply with it. They can't get away with as much in Australia without getting kicked out at the next election as they can in America. Now you can all get divorced just like me :D Love wins! Except when it doesn’t! My ex-wives didn't seem to mind. Wait... who has to pay child support if there is no ex-husband? I pay child support to my second wife. The first wife was really married to her vidya, she took half me steam list in the end :( What a shitty person, you can take my money, my house, my food, but never ever, my steam account. I feel you man Cheers mate :) Child Support Probation Officer here:  I know you're joking, but mothers actually pay child support all the time. It's an outdated stereotype about Family Court that we never side with the father.  If you file the appropriate motions, show up to court, and bring the required documentation, it's an even playing field. A guidelines calculation is made based on income. This calculation affects all aspects of the case, from custody and visitation to child support and medical coverage. The guidelines do not give a shit if you're male or female--they're raw data.  TL;DR: The person most likely to provide a stable and safe home environment becomes CP (Custodial Party AKA Obligee AKA Parent of Primary Residence), while the other parent becomes NCP (Non-Custodial Party AKA Obligor AKA Parent of Alternate Residence.) Most importantly, the person who TAKES PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SHOWS UP TO COURT PREPARED USUALLY WINS. I was joking.  Sadly however, having been an advocate in custody disputes my experience is inconsistent with yours. Far too often 'stable' is given precedence over 'safe'. Too often have I seen a negligent mother retain custody because the father is a soldier who despite having support arrangements in place might need to deploy at short notice.  In these cases, the disciplined loving father is assessed by the family court as a cash cow, whilst the mother lives fat and happy off the support payments - all the while seeking a new target to fall pregnant to. Who gets the house when gay guys divorce? the bottom? I spose it's up to the courts to decide really. Same-sex it up same-sex couples of Australia, you've earned this day. Fuck it. I'm straight and I might go marry a dude just to rub it in Tony Abbott's big dumb face.  How could you care about marriage when a man is getting eaten by a croc in North Queensland? It was a male croc so it was a same sex mauling and that is legal now. Just reminds me of smith streets "Wipe that shit eating grin off your punchable face" Don't knock it until you tried it Can I interest you in an alimony payment when we divorce?   I mean Tony Abbott will surely see who’s boss /s How do you earn something like that, that is ridicolous  My interpretation of what you said, was that you meant: It’s absolutely ridiculous that gay couples couldn’t get married earlier, and, that they should not have even had to earn/ fight for that right. I'll bet benefits will extend to same sex spouses bc it just makes fucking sense, mate.  Can't wait to watch Australian Gay Divorce Court. Divorce court shows gon b gud Yup,  prospect for divorce lawyers are rising further. 👊 And florists, and bakers, and candlestick makers and tailors and caterers and jewelers and wedding band players. Except, [according to America](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/05/gay-wedding-cake-supreme-court-280944), for the homophobic ones.  On one hand, I want everyone to have equal access to all goods and services regardless of sexual orientation.  On the other hand, I don't want the people who *would* deny service to gay individuals to get any business.  Maybe we can force them to make the cakes, and then boycott them *anyway*? Yeah that was going on even before the federal legalization though, down at the state levels.    Will there be any follow-up with Muslim bakeries too (to bake wedding cakes for gays)? This case also presents a precedence for people who might ask Muslims to bake a bacon cake too. Human rights aren't things that should be approved by legislative or executive bodies because that means we concede such powers to our congress/parliaments. As such, they can just as easily take them away when a society goes through a fascist phase, as all do at some point. Human rights are not up to any mortal entity to pass judgement on. Human rights and inalienable rights are a concept, not an actual thing. As society evolves and morality evolves, different societies will change their views on what constitute human rights. They do not become an actual thing until legislation is passed, and even then they are only a thing within that jurisdiction.  This is an unpopular view, but is the reality. Human Rights were given to us by God! I’m still nervous Trump is going to do that. He said he wouldn’t but he says lots of stuff that he ends up changing his mind on. He’s pretty bent on rolling back everything Obama did just because Obama did it.  The president can't undo a supreme court ruling. But then again, anyone can do anything if the people who hold guns for a living are willing to follow any order. &gt; The president can't undo a supreme court ruling  Not alone but the goal of the GOP, as outlined on page 11 of their official party platform, is to appoint conservative Supreme Court justices to help overturn the marriage equality ruling. They already blocked Obamas nomination and appointed their own, now Trump is going to likely get a few more picks during his term.   Once this happens their goal is to bring a case that can challenge it to the Supreme Court in hopes to overturn the ruling. There's already one such case there right now.   You also have places like Texas who decided on a whim that marriage equality doesn't mean marriage equality and that gay couples can still be denied benefits (which is currently happening in Houston).   And Trump actually did promise 4 times that I know of to attempt to overturn marriage equality. First was on a (now removed) page on his personal site under the title "Issues of Importance to Catholics" where he outlined the GOP plan, then again in three more interviews.   Religious people absolutely HATE gay people, and they have lots of money and pay out to groups who constantly work against our rights.  Who gets to determine what is a human right and what isn't? OP of course. So what happens when you set up a brand new government? Do these rights just happen?  We don't have a Bill of Rights down under. Parliament giveth and Parliament taketh away our human rights at its leisure. (Except for freedom of religion at a federal level, but state parliaments could take that away if they wanted to.)  Parliament can't taketh shit from an armed and angry population that's ready to storm the Bastille.  Good thing the Australian citizens are so disarmed good  people should have their right to marry who they want to marry And idk why a government has a say in it in the first place While I applaud Australia, I can't wait until the label "same-sex" isn't used anymore.  As a typical lazy straight guy, it's just extra words.  Seems unnecessary. How would you name the article?  Australian Parliament approves marriage equality All adults who love each other finally allowed to marry.  Besides, how is that less wording?  The other person didn't want less wording. They wanted the words same sex to go away.  What about already married adults?  That's why I said all. Some could before, now all of them can.  In a land where everyone is equally allowed to be terrorized by the wildlife, everyone should be equally allowed to live their lives as they please. Dilly Dilly, you delightful Aussies :) Why does BBC never load on my phone? Meanwhile in America:  "The president is fine with 'no-gays allowed' signs"  -the Whitehouse press secretary   I find it interesting that the USA is the only ones that get shit on for gay rights.  It's 2017 and Australia just legalized it, yet i've never heard a word about this. I assumed it had been legal... Trust me, if you were **in** Australia, you'd have heard it. Here in Melbourne some guy took his plane up to the sky and wrote "Vote No" in the sky. Didn't you hear? The USA is the center of the universe. becoz you never been to other countries i beez on de interwebz doe It took a legal loophole to allow same sex marriage in the States because its society is so backward thinking it would have never been legalized in Congress (which is the real representative of the people) But it's legal, what excuse does australia have? You missed the point, Australian society is actually more forward thinking than the Statian, a same sex marriage law would've never passed the popular vote or the lawmakers vote About fucking time, looks like they worked out what country they work for! Useless pack of fuck knuckles. [removed] You can feel gross all you like, it's not an argument against same-sex marriage. You've been brought up in an environment where homosexuality is seen by many around you as in anyway wrong and have inherited some subconscious prejudice. It's pretty normal and hard to help, but don't expect a pat on the back for it and maybe try and work on getting more comfortable around homosexuals  I grew up with a gay best friend who is equally grossed out when I kiss a girl, care to explain again? I'm as comfortable around a gay dude as I am a straight dude, that has absolutely nothing to do with what grosses me out You obviously aren't. You compared same sex couples to wiping your ass.  You were against gay marriage in past (and possibly still)?   &gt; I'm as comfortable around a gay dude as I am a straight dude, that has absolutely nothing to do with what   You find it difficult to be around gay people when they show affection which by definition makes you less comfortable around them than around heterosexuals.  Either way, acknowledge that it is irrational and try not to share it with someone who may be hurt or offended.   I was against gay marriage in the past? And uh try not to be hurt or offended makes no sense, you can't tell a person they aren't allowed to say something offensive while also not being allowed to be offended, if something offends me and I don't have the right to be offensive right back then the one offending me is being given rights and privilege that I don't have, while everyone tells me I have all the privilege in the world &gt;I was against gay marriage in the past?   Yeah, it's in your post history.  &gt;you can't tell a person they aren't allowed to say something offensive while also not being allowed to be offended   There is nothing rational about being offended by two men kissing.    &gt;something offends me and I don't have the right to be offensive right back then the one offending me is being given rights and privilege that I don't have  Yes, because their offense is rational and yours is not. If I find your face offensive I have no right to tell you to wear a bag over your head, and if you tell me to get stuffed for airing that opinion you are right and I am wrong.  Like I went and saw a live WWE event a week ago with a gay dude, WWE is already hella gay so certainly not contributed to my environment As one of those men you think are gross and disgusting, let me just say that its absolutely 100% OK for you to get weirded out or grossed out when you see me kiss another guy. Never apologize for how you feel, just be you. If you think 2 people in love is disgusting then by all means, be disgusted.   But in the wise words of Butters Stotch, ask yourself: "what is it about **their** actions that makes **me** uncomfortable?" What is the connection there? Why do you feel connected to that? Really explore that *why.* Are you automatically imagining them naked in bed together having sex? Are you afraid that you like it a little? Are you subconsciously afraid you might be gay? Because that's exactly what it looks like. Admittedly, I find it a little gross too. No offense or anything. And I'm all for gay rights. But I can always just look away, and we shouldn't let stuff like feeling "gross" affect policy. The thought of my parents having sex is absolutely disgusting to me... so then why isn't it gross when I see them kiss or hold hands? Two reasons: 1) I'm a mature adult. 2) I don't instantaneously sexualize everything I see. If people are having trouble discerning the difference between "affection" and "sex" then there are other underlying issues at play.   That being said, its still possible for people to display their affection in public in distasteful ways, regardless of their preferences. I've seen heterosexual teenagers kissing that made me feel gross. It wasn't because of their gender, it was because of their tasteless PDA.  Gay people have to see depictions of heterosexuality everywhere else and besides saying that you feel gross just seeing it is extremely ridiculous and bigoted so ya you are kind of an asshole.  I don't wanna see heterosexuals or any other sexual anything, don't wanna see a straight couple making out either though I thought I addressed that  No you did not “address” that at all   Because your post explicitly says “two dudes”  It does not say “displays of affection by anyone”  Trying to retcon your post to sound less like a bigot? Thats extremely dramatic and unique to you then buddy. Most people on the planet can tolerate other people showing effection to each other in public who the fuck cares. Its not like they are having sex right in front of you. Oh sorry did the though of that make you feel gross?   Honestly you can be grossed out about it but im just saying why do you feel the need to share that? No one said you had to approve of it just live and let live. You dont like it dont look. So you never want to see or think about anything sexual, ever?  You might be on the wrong planet for that kind of life chief. Feel grossed out as much as you like, just keep it to yourself. So... someone doesn't keep themself, I don't enjoy it and therefore I have to keep to myself? Seems like the opposite of "do whatever you like as long as it doesn't affect the happiness of others", it is certainly more appropriate to ask people not to make out in public than to ask the entire public to turn a blind eye OK fine. I don't like football, so from now on that's banned. Um. Try "banned from being played in public" instead of reaching so far, banning football from being played in public aside of football-specific events wouldn't be strange, if you play football at walmart you're a moron and if you're making out with your significant other in walmart you're a moron Yeah, but I hate football chants, football kits, and football supporters. And since we're all about what *I* want to see, that's all banned from now on. Football will no longer be televised, not played on an open field where someone might per chance see it being played. &gt;it is certainly more appropriate to ask people not to make out in public than to ask the entire public to turn a blind eye  You said kiss earlier. It is absolutely not appropriate to ask people not to kiss in public, people kiss in public all the time. So it is appropriate for a couple to sit there in each other's faces while my family tries to eat a meal? That makes ME the inappropriate one for asking them not to? I certainly can't see how, the progressive era is a cancerous one &gt;So it is appropriate for a couple to sit there in each other's faces while my family tries to eat a meal?  You are shifting the goalposts now. Your original post referred to kissing of any type. If someone is being inappropriately affectionate you can reasonably ask them to stop, but this has nothing to do with their sexual orientation.   The trolling works better if you can keep it somewhat consistent, and save the “so much for the tolerant left” screed for a better moment, but otherwise, decent effort. Holy shit dude you're so much looking for fights in all answers. The moment you compared two people kissing to you wiping yourselves you lost everyone.  The fact that you find it disgusting is a product of society. You wouldnt bat an eye if society told you at young age it was normal. You might thinkg Im wrong, but there is literally no dofference between a guy and a girl kisses. Are you that disgusted by girl kissing ?  I can admit that 2 guy kissing still weird me out a bit but its just because its still a bit unusual to me and I just go over it cause im a grown adult and they are too. No it isn't, it's called mind your damn business like an adult. Public space isn't yours to police. You're just digging yourself deeper into a hole at this point.  It is illegal for a man and a women to kiss in public in India and Muslim countries. Is that the direction you want Australia to go in. Yep, youre an unlovable  asshole.   90% of your posts are scolding people for same sex marriage. 90% of my posts are from today so yeah that would make sense, except I'm for same sex marriage so you are clearly quite confused You got to lighten up dude. If you ever go to Europe you'll just drown in grossness. There men kiss in greeting.  Oh come on, that's a light peck not a full on make out Those two dudes probably feel the same way seeing a man and woman kiss. You can feel however you want to feel. Don’t like it, don’t get gay married. Leave others to do as they please.  I dont get this. So much music and tv shows and movies these days have depictions of couples being extremely sexual towards each other or straight up having sex and it is almost always heterosexual depictions. Which is completely fine but you never hear gay people bitching and moaning about having to see that because it would be fucking retarded.  I think its sweet when i see two people who love each other showing effection, whatever sexuality they are. Not that everyone has to feel that way but it is really dramatic to me to genuinely be grossed out just by a simple kiss on the lips. Not being gay doesn't mean you find men disgusting you just arent sexually attracted to them. Thats just my opinion though, since he did ask for it. You need to ask yourself why you are grossed out.  The standard viewpoint is that you shouldn't care whether two men are kissing or not. I see two men kissing and I feel nothing. Maybe I'll crack a smile if I can see they are clearly in love.  Even seeing a dick in porn or whatever doesn't phase me. I'm just like, "yup, that's a dick" and go about my day.  It is arguably conditioning or culture you have experienced that has led you to this repulsed reaction, because in many societies throughout history homosexuality was accepted, not to mention it occurs naturally in nature in most mammals (perhaps most species?).  Are you religious, or were you raised in as religious/conservative family? the freedom that allows same sex couples to marry is the same freedom that allows him to be grossed out by it. Yes, but being grossed out by it is confusing enough for him that he's coming here asking what's up with that.  That's a sign that you're not entirely sure why you are the way you are.  Being grossed out by things you don't understand takes far more mental energy than simply not giving a shit. [deleted] But he's literally just asked us all for our opinion.  And for what is worth, everyone should question themselves every day, on everything. That's how you grow. [deleted] Are you seriously asking why questioning the things you believe and your attitudes has value? [deleted] I think you read too much into what I was saying there. [deleted] Yeah I just meant that if he was confused enough that he needed to come here and ask for opinions on his being grossed out then he might want to ask himself why that is.  I wasn't suggesting that he absolutely must change his viewpoint lol.  I could have worded my original comment better. I'm gay. You can feel grossed out. You probably can't help it. Cheese totally grosses me out. Everyone loves cheese, but I gag every time I smell it. The key is, I don't restrict other people from having cheese. I just sort of look away recognizing it's their right to enjoy cheese even if I don't. So, you can be grossed out. Just don't try and stop people from pursuing their kiss because you get a little queezy, and we're cool.  Well if you’re a guy the act of kissing another guy is likely to gross you out so no People are already downvoting haha like they're offended that they offended me which somehow makes me the bad guy... such hypocritical times we live in Says the person retconning their entire post to try and pretend they’re not a bigot is whining about being downvotes and accuses others of being hypocrites?  POT  KETTLE  BLACK Your being downvoted because thinking it's gross is not a legal argument against same sex marriage.  Where did he argue against same sex marriage, I must have missed that part. You are making things up. Does it gross you out when you see two women kiss? I was weirded out the first time I saw it too and I'm gay. It's just not something most people are used to seeing so there's a shock factor to it. Many gay guys will tell you the same.   As long as you're not combative if you see someone kiss or want to deny us rights you're fine in my book.  [removed] Right? Isn't love disgusting? It must be nice to live in a democracy where these questions are settled by the legislature and hence the voters. Unlike in the US where these questions get settled by judges.   Edit: to be clear - I have supported Same Sex Marriage since 1996 when the issue first came on my radar. I arrived at that position because I believe the government should have as small an impact as possible on our lives. I just feel that these questions should be handled thru the legislative process. Things passed thru the legislative process have more legitimacy in the eyes of the public and therefor create a more stable society. It wasn't really settled by voters. This was the result of the government keeping a promise to pass the bill if a survey showed it was what Australians wanted. Technically yes it was "voted" on. I am more impressed by the fact that this happened under what is a historically conservative liberal government.  Labor is secretly fuming that they just lost their prime electoral policy. Probably the main reason why they did it so that  labor has less fuel for the fire  you can only get so far with Medicare scare tactics To be fair, Turnbull openly supported SSM before Shorten did. He just had much stronger factional and coalition party opposition to placate.  Given the number of Labor held electorates with a significant percentage of No voters, I'm far more interested to see potential swings there.  I am legitimately concerned we may very well be on the verge of seeing ethnicly aligned minor parties hold seats in western Sydney. Because judges are smart enough to realize that the rights of the minority shouldn't be allowed to be determined by the majority who *already has those rights*.  What the supreme court did was strike down unconstitutional state laws. Those state laws violated the 14th amendment and human rights. Yea! Why should Judges ***enforce the Constitution*** you guyz!?!? Maybe if US didnt vote shitty people who put shitty judge into power ? Its the same. judges or whoever can provide the biggest ~~bribe~~ donation [removed] I can't wait to force everyone to make cakes for me. I'm gonna demand they have a big ol' hammer and sickle as the whole cake so the whole gay family can have slices of communism as they celebrate how fucking gay we are.  Or they'll just awkwardly eat our gay communist cake and not ask too many questions. Im not actually convinced the protection amendments are necessary - even for bakers and florists. Antidiscrimination legislation requires you to demonstrate the reason for refusal of service was on account of membership of a protected class.  A baker need only ensure that it isn't the sexuality of the customer he objects to, but the activity he is asked to support. Sexuality is not actually part of the legal definition and any argument to the contrary fails on account of no legal requirement to consummate the marriage.  Two straight men can get married just as easily as two gay men. Providing the baker would deny service to both couples, you can't say either have been discriminated against on account of their sexuality. You’re a joke. Can you imagine the horror those poor florists experience when they put those flowers in a jar? Can you imagine the horror that a baker experiences when they put that cake in the oven? And someone has to *::gag::* take pictures *::dry heave::* of people in love? So disgusting.   If I was a photographer and you asked to be my client I would refuse because photographing ugly and obese people is unholy and against my religion. Stop shoving your ugliness down our throats! I don't know what business you are in, but what if you were forced,  under the threat of litigation and fines, to perform your service in support of NAZIs or the KKK? Do you think you should have the right to morally object and say, "I don't support this, and I'm not going to give my time, efforts and talents to do this thing for them."   There's a name for the act of forcing or coercing people to do work for you whether they like it or not. It's called slavery.  OK I'll entertain your ridiculous analogy. I design elevators. If for some absurd reason the US government suddenly forced me to design an elevator for the Nazis I would **find a new job.** Nobody is forcing me to be an engineer. Next question?  But on a side note, if you actually seriously legitimately believe that baking a cake for 2 gay dudes is the same thing as supporting the Nazis or the KKK then you're too stupid to be having this conversation at all.  Plz legalise asexual marriage Isn’t that already legal? Not for coral or jellyfish it isnt Okay? What’s your point? Plenty of asexuals are married - the physical act of sex and sexual attraction is a less important part of the coupling than in other people's marriage.   What part isn't legal already.  [removed] What's the difference? You think 2 men or 2 women can't raise a child in the same way that one of each can?  [deleted] So when a woman’s husband dies, the child should be removed from her and given to a couple? Makes sense, too bad you aren’t in charge.   Every scientific study has shown that children raised by stable same-sex couples have similar (sometimes better) outcomes to children raised by het couples. Better even because parents who can afford to adopt are usually wealthier and can afford more opportunities for their children. Well, given the sheer risk of that child being a criminal or otherwise malevolent actor in society from a single mother household, an unethical, but still foundationed argument can be made. but what does it have to do with it? One thing is to die another is to have 2 fathers or 2 mothers.I'm no against samesex marriage, but but what does the child have to do with it?do you know how many discriminations will the kid receive? That’s ridiculous. It’s like saying people of one race shouldn’t adopt children of another race because some people might make fun of the kid. No, yeah, best to avoid that and deny a child two loving parents and a healthy upbringing. This is my thought.  And you see nothing wrong with that? That’s crazy. I guess short people or people with red hair or minorities shouldn’t breed because what if the kid gets harassed for their differences, then, right? This is the world my friend. You could accept same sex or mixed race adoptions, and fight against any abuse they receive.   But instead you ignore the actual cause of the problem, and rather people didn't get into the situation in the first place. You realise you are just making the situation worse, right? If these were more common, there would be less abuse going on until it becomes background noise. But instead you reinforce the idea that these adoptions are bad, which reinforces the abuse against people who do have them. None. The child won’t receive discrimination because of their parents. Harassment by assholes maybe, but why blame the gay couple for harassment by bigots? This is my thought.  That battle has been fought and lost in Australiaa few years ago. All the foster agencies specifically target same sex couples where I am at.  So you'd rather an orphan have **no father** than him having two fathers? Wow that's fucked up. Literally the only sentence you ever have to say to destroy the no gay adoption argument.  Loving your work.  This is my thought.  IMO same sex marriage is not the problem. Trying to force others to validate a lifestyle that they disagree with through legislation is. No-one forced anyone to become a celebrant. The celebrant isn't personally validating anything, they're just doing paperwork. If they don't like doing that paperwork, they should get a different job. No no, you see, *being forced to tolerate their existence as equals under the laws of society instead of chasing them out of town or killing them like in the Good Ol' Days* is forcing people to validate a lifestyle they disagree with. LGBT people have been forced to "validate" hetero marriage since, well, forever. Didn't hear you moaning about that.
 Not gonna lie, I always check air bnb bathrooms and bedrooms because of this.  You should the same in motels and hotels.  Happens there too. I travel a lot for work so I definitely do. I’ve never found anything in a hotel/Airbnb but I have found one in an airline rewards programs shower room. It was under the bench that looked into the shower. Honestly I thought it was super obvious, and the staff handled it very professionally.  &gt;the staff handled it very professionally.   This can be interpreted in many different ways   Camera in your shower room?  That's 10,000 free miles for you!   ^20,000 ^if ^you ^let ^us ^keep ^the ^footage &gt;^20,000 ^if ^you ^let ^us ^keep ^the ^footage  fuck it, you want a trilogy? Hell, if someone were filming me, they may pay me to get dressed. Either way, I win. Ya, you eat that cereal, you filthy filthy whore. :0 if they were filming me I might get sued for emotional damage They don't need to hide it for free miles. *cue in porn music* *R. Kelly music seems to come from no where* It’s sex not pee man   Edit: nvm it’s pee  &gt; pee man  Worst superhero ever. "Urine trouble now, crook."                       *-pee man* What is it that you look for? I'll be travelling and using AirBnB because it's the cheapest option for the area I'll be in.. There is no foolproof way, it is especially difficult to [locate pinhole cameras](https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/hd-composite-cash-machine-cam-v2new.jpg), but here are some general tips:  * One way to detect infrared cameras is to use [your camera on your phone to look for infrared sources](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsSZ3IMUQYE). Turn off all the lights, close the blinds, then turn on camera mode and look around the room. (Note that this doesn't work on every phone camera, iPhones for example, only the front facing one works, the main camera has an IR filter), you can maybe use a webcam. You will be looking for an out of place glowing, possibly purple, most likely just plain white. (Test your camera by pointing a TV remote at it and see if you can see the remote blink)  * Use a torch (your flashlight on your phone) to shine into vents, drains (especially showers, both in the floor and in the shower itself) and in dark areas, look for reflections, wires or mechanical parts you don't recognize.  * Check the corners of the roof, look for anything out of place, bumps or lumps.  * Check everything at or below waist level, under sinks, toilets, beds.  * Be wary of mirrors in places that you wouldn't expect  * Cover (sheets/blankets) any devices that you might be concerned with, this includes TV's, DVD players, clocks/clockradios/intercoms, [stuffed toys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzSPIojeGEA), ornaments, lights. They all could easily hide hidden cameras in their chassis. Keep in mind that some smart TV's now come with cameras.  If you are really paranoid, shower in your swim-wear, [change in a portable tent](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/aeef68af-a6e5-42f4-b5b6-e49c1cd69146_1.17b9bbb90d9e60eabfae25073fc8a645.jpeg). You know you’re approaching middle age if you’re, like, goddamn, that’s a lot of work for a place I’m staying one or two nights, just watch me pee if it means that much to you. I lost it at the "change in a portable tent" part. Shit's hilarious. Right? I'd obviously rather you not. But I'm not going to search your house making sure you don't get a video of me naked.  Here, just have a video of my subpar naked body, you fucking weirdo. To add one thing to this list.  Turn the lights on and off in a room giving yourself about 10-15 seconds between each flip of the switch. Listen for a click after you do it. Most cameras that are used for this sort of thing are both day and night time cameras and you can usually hear a click as it switches from the visible spectrum to the IR.  Not always the case but something to look out for. Fire detectors, DVR's and vents shouldn't be clicking just because you turned the light off.  well, you gotta look for a camera, but it can be disguised so also look for any object whose purpose you can't immediately identify. Lol. Then you wont find shit. There's all kinds of cheap spy cams disguised as all kinds of everyday objects and look nothing like cameras. A screw in the door could have a camera. exactly. spy cams need only a pinhole I heard a hotel magnate earlier this year say that cameras in hotel rooms can be in microwaves. There was someone in my work place (one of the big 4) who was caught placing hidden cameras in toilets and showers, also in nearby coffee shops.   He had tens of thousands of meticulously categorised and indexed videos.   He was only caught because when they watched the recordings from the camera they spotted in the showers, the first recording on it was him putting it there.   LPT if you're going to do it, have a time delay on it turning on.  LPT don't do it  The real LPT is always in the comment...thread. Wouldn’t expect anything less from the Big 4 &gt; You should the same in motels and hotels.  But what about Holiday Inns? Not sure. My girl started acting up. Screw her, maybe she has a friend you could take?   Motel, hotel, holiday Innnnn  you'll never find them all    https://i.imgur.com/PdvlQ1e.png Terrifyingly discrete. That's why you have to always cover the smoke detectors :) LPT   ETA "/s" bc I feel that it's needed bc I actually recall a thread about someone covering it to hide their smoking. I can see some idiot covering the smoke detector bc they think that someone's filming them. Honestly if someone wants to jack it to me shitting my ass dry, I say let them.  Those lovable little scamps. I always assume someone is watching at all times, and therefore, it's my responsibility to put on a good show for them. poo diligence   And be *professional*.  We owe it to the person who spent that much time/effort setting the camera up to begin with.   Dear lord if someone has watched me when my stomach gives me trouble, they are scarred for fucking life. They're going out of their way to watch people deuce and you think a little diarrhea is going to scar them?  You think I'm talking "a little" diarrhea?? I'm guessing the harder you spew, the harder they get.   “Shitting my ass dry” is my new term for pooping. Is there an efficient and reliable way to check for cameras? It's pretty easy to hide one so that they're impossible to find You have to wait until it's dark (Or close the curtains).  Turn out all light sources in the room and stand in the corner. Get a flash light or torch, and shine it across the room. Any camera lenses will reflect the light and you'll know to check that area.  Also works with spiders in the garden. but what if it's in the corner you're standing in? O_o *scratches noggin* What if the spiders are in your room?  How paranoia are you willing to be? http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/how-to/a7614/build-your-own-electromagnetic-interference-detector-8831727/ This is good but what I'm trying to detect electronic *infetterance*? Ever find anything? I'm friends with one of the girls. She was a cheerleader and this was where they all tanned.  http://www.tantoday.com/forums/news-about-tanning/18324-springfield-tanning-salon-owner-charged-videotaping-customers.html   The tanning salon thing also happened in a tanning salon in a dirty little English seaside town I used to live in called Margate about ten years ago.  The owner/perp went to prison for it.  Also a friend's sister was married to a guy who who had a webcam in the bathroom filming his 15 year old stepdaughter.  She found it, told her mother and her mother sent her to live with her grandmother as she was determined "to stick by her husband". How do you check exactly ? Visual inspection with ya eyeballs Ocular patdown Then you clear them for passage.  Ah, the old Mark 1 Version 1 eyeball.  In another article they mentioned turning the lights off and use a flashlight, the lens of the camera will reflect the light. Won't find all of them but it's a cheap effective method  Grab a paper towel roll and a flashlight and hold the roll up to one eye and close the other. In a darkened room, turn on the flashlight and place it at eye level next to the tube and slowly scan the room for the telltale white reflection. You can pretend you're a pirate standing on the bow of your cutter if that helps. Arrr.  The best time to do this is mid day on a weekday at your office restroom. This is when human activity is highest so you are much more likely to catch a camera in its natural habitat.  *This post brought to you by voyeurpiratefetish.com* Set off a nuclear device 60,000 feet over the building. The EMP will knock out any cameras.  Buy a $10 RF detector that also has a camera reflector.  Or spend money for professional shit that can detect even more shit.   Or just look with eyes and a light.  &gt; Buy a $10 RF detector that also has a camera reflector.  I have one of these and it detected everything everywhere.  Either it was faulty or I had multiple international government agencies with high interest in me. No, there really is that much RF noise leaking everywhere.  If you find a phone or tablet that is filming, take the fucking evidence before you report. Finding a cam in a bathroom or bedroom is police report time; keep the camera and call the non emergency police line and enjoy the fun.  Where I live the non-emergency line just transfers you to dispatch aka 911.  Yeah, i tried to call a non emergency line with a noise complaint because I thought 911 was for emergencies.  The secretary on the other end laughed and told me to call 911. Had the opposite experience where my dumbass neighbor kept calling 911 to complain out noise from my family. Police had a policy to respond to all 911 calls so they kept having to come down to tell us that our construction work was fine they just have to show up.  I'm a dispatcher. Next time ask the officers what their department policy is on harassment by police. At my PD you can be charged for repeatedly calling the police for an issue that isn't illegal. This happened to my brothers neighbors. Some old lady kept complaining about the noise next door (duplex) and when the police showed up for the 3rd time when my brother was playing on his computer with headphones on, they charged her with something (I'm sure it's just a slap on the wrist) but magically the calls to the police stopped after that. Our term is harassment by police, which sounds a little misleading, but it's using the police to harass someone. It's most often fake noise complaints or fake welfare check (ex-wife doesn't like dad's new girlfriend so keeps calling in concerned about the kids when she has no reason to be, so officers go check on them and end up bothering then needlessly).  Where my GF at the time &amp; I lived, we had a neighbor below us (Condo) and she was a nurse and worked various shifts. So in the mornings (8-11) when shes trying to go to bed. We were walking around or talking on the balcony, vacuuming, or etc she would call the cops for noise complaints during "sleeping hours".     She called the cops on all 4 units in the building. She called the cops on the guy starting his Corvette that was parked out front at 7am to go to work (Told the cop "If he's going to work at 7am, he needs a quieter car!" )       She was off the rails crazy, and she was making noise "going to work" at 9pm-11pm  she eventually moved.  And the cops stopped coming for noise complaints after awhile. This complaint was due to a large construction dumpster right next to our bedroom window that for some reason at 4 am they had to lift several feet off the ground a drop it straight down in order to switch it out with an empty one. It with the loudest bang I would awake heart racing.  I asked them politely if they could do it some other time, got cussed out.  Called the cops, and it never happened again. My department has a non emergency line, it’s the same people as calling 911 but the phone systems recognizes you as low priority. Also you might be placed on hold if there’s a surge of 911 calls  Came here to say this. I called the non-emergency line and was on hold for 30 minutes until they answered "911". Realized I was on hold while they answered the emergencies and I wasn't an emergency so I had to wait. Was ok with that.  I called the non emergency line and told the person I wanted to do a test of my 911 service, and she said go ahead they would put a note down.  So I go to call 911... And get the exact same operator. Turns out it was the same people answering both phone lines and calls just flash up on their screen differently depending on what you dialed. Thats small towns for you I guess. I once had a friend find a camera in the bathroom of the apartment he and his wife leased.   It ain't just Airbnb folks. This. I always hated that 'maintenance' could have a key to your apartment. There's no telling what goes on. Put your own camera in your living room then.   I have a PiperNV system setup that sends me a 30s video of it detects any movement when I’m not there and if the doors or window sensors trip I get a text message. Took 5 minutes to install with the 4 door/window sensors.  Yeah this is a pretty foolproof system, I'm thinking of getting one. But $100-$200 investment for one of these at the very least.  &gt; But $100-$200 investment for one of these at the very least.  Fuck that's cheap compared to a couple of years ago. Yeah, but $100 is really just the budget level products. This is what I did. Any time I called maintenance I’d just check up on them at work. Plus, I had motion detection set to email me every time. Got a lot of footage of my cat, but there was always a piece of mind.  I recently moved from a really sketchy apartment complex and I flat out did not trust the management/maintenance, even better the maintenance people were a 3rd party contractor so even if they stole our shit while we lived there, apartment management couldn't be held responsible.  They often sent out notices for "inspections" for this and that reason and every time, I called the front desk asking what time my building would be inspected, as I would be taking an hour off work to be in the unit at that time.  Amazingly enough, my apartment was never inspected......  Also when I turned in my notice that I wouldn't be renewing my lease, they sent me a notice telling me that management would be doing an unannounced inspection sometime within 10 days before or 10 days after the end of my lease.  I called the front desk raising hell, and they told me that they had no such policy and didn't know what I was talking about, even though I was reading directly off the notice stamped with their management logo. I know in VA they have to give a 24 hr notice before they can enter to inspect. so this " Eh sometime we will come in and look" One time I caught maintenance guys going through my cupboards in the kitchen. They didn't know I was home. Called my roommate, and she told them she wouldn't be home for a few hours, so they said they'd come in the afternoon. Turns out they were standing at the door when they spoke with her. "Uh, we're here to fix the leak." "You mean the dripping faucet in the bathroom?" I caught a maintenance man stealing weed from me once What a fuckin dick As a maintenance man.. We need access in case of an emergency  Like a flood or fire. I can't tell you how many times I've entered a unit for a water leak where no one is home. I know its unnerving but its necessary   Also we don't want to be there. Its too easy for some prick to accuse me of stealing a 20 that was never even there to begin with. Thanks for your perspective on this - it helps.  And it was a $100 And my priceless artwork. And my axe! &gt; Also we don't want to be there.  That's the problem. You can't talk for everyone. There are always fucking weirdos in all professions, I'm certain all maintenance staff aren't exclusively 100% good persons neither.  Why don't you buy a GoPro and records your way in and out, no cuts? Nobody would accuse you of something, specially if the house has alarm and you need to disable it, and it has a log about when it was turned off.  Edit: stupid idea? How the fuck are you going back inside without turning off the alarm again and having it logged, just to steal? If someone wants to steal so bad, they'll break in later, not during work. Then somebody could just say they stole something on a trip without the GoPro on. Not that hard to record one "clean trip" then go back without the camera rolling and snatch something.  Because you shouldn’t have to invest $300 for a stupid camera as a maintenance guy Where I live they have to inform you 24h in advance if its not an emergency.  Twice I entered my apartment and noticed they came to do stuffs without my knowledge.  Then my sink pipe broke and it took 1 month to be fixed. Hated them. I was wondering if there's something I could buy to detect recording devices.  I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KMzEx3cpA).  Illuminating.  (I can't attest to whatever he's selling though.)  E:  Apparently, there's this contraption called a cc308+ that can do the job for cheap.  Here's [one video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyGVa_ywX2w).  E2:  More expensive (and probably more reliable) [options](https://www.uspystore.com/counter-surveillance/hidden-camera-detectors#).  An old standby is to turn off the lights in a room and use a flashlight; the camera lens will reflect a shine in a place where there shouldn't be a shine.  Works but you have to shine the light at the same angle takes forever and a large room for error Aren't most camera lenses convex, so there's a way bigger angle at which you'd see glare? Yes, to focus the light. It should reflect from all angles unless they put a flat piece of glass on front to prevent people from finding it easily.  The same thing works for finding spiders.  During the summer head out to a dark area with a bright flashlight.  Shine a flashlight at the ground.  All that sparkling you think is dew is actually spider's eyes retroreflecting the light you are shining.    I didn't believe this the first time I read it.  Then I happened to be on a jogging boardwalk after dark with a headlamp.  I look down and see all these drops of dew...then I remembered my newly found fact.  So I got down for a closer inspection of these drops of dew.  Sure enough...spiders...spiders everywhere!   Thanks for ruining dew! If they have WiFi then you can also use an app like Fing to see if there’s any suspicious devices on the network.   Assumes they’re dumb enough to use the same network you’re on, anyway.  There's a good chance it's just offline recording to a microSD card, too.  huh. one time i found a forum of people posting 'airbnb porn' on mega. thought it was all fake.. now i'm not so sure I've stumbled upon a few of these on 4chan. They look pretty legit. Plus those weirdos literally follow women in the street and film up their skirts so I believe it. If the hidden camera has an infrared illuminator to see in the dark, turn off the lights and scant he room with you phone's camera app.   Any illuminator will typically appear as blue or purple on your screen because the sensor on the phone can see IR light.  I have a thermal camera that plugs into my phone. It can also be used to detect abnormal heat sources like recording equipment hidden in otherwise cold objects.  This presumes the cameras are wireless They usually are, wiring your home with cameras is expensive and done for more specific purposes, you have to tear up your walls usually, that's no joke. Only a very, very dedicated perv would do that just for AbnB. Wireless cameras are cheap, small, no wiring, easy to hide. I'd wager 99% of those cams in the article are wireless. Or recording locally. Amazon has [**a bunch**](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=a9_asi_1?rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Ahidden+camera&amp;keywords=hidden+camera&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1512657414) of hidden cameras disguised as things like usb chargers, smoke detectors, alarm clocks, etc. And they all seem to record to microSD. I wonder how you can find them.  I mean of course they are. You’ve got to think that there are tons of people out there that only do airbnb to get footage like this  Not only that but the renters probably don't trust the people renting and want to keep an eye on them. funny these cameras were found in the bathroom and bedrooms pointed at the bed.  You can put cameras in normal places for safety and let the renter know.  Safety was not the purpose in these cases. Yep, I have been in an airbnb where the owner said there was a camera on the front and back porch, there was, but I also looked around the airbnb to make sure that is all they had One place had a camera linked to the security system iirc. Dude told us how to disable it if we wanted to.  Except it's illegal in most states to film someone in a place where they have a reasonable expectation of privacy without their consent. I agree, i'm not saying its right, i'm just saying I don't think its just guys trying to see naked people. I think some of these people are under the assumption that its ok if you are trying to protect your stuff. Its not. This is why my home won't ever be in the program. It's literally blanketed in camera coverage and it would take too long to document it all.  The article mentioned Switzerland so the issue spans more than just the US rentals seeing that Airbnb is in almost all places. Tho it probably is also illegal in Switzerland Yeah I understand that logic, but at the same time that's one of the risks you're signing up for when you're basically getting paid to rent your living space out to strangers to a website that makes it super easy to find clients. It's no different than being an Uber driver and having someone puke all over, or physically damage, your car's interior.  You can't have one foot in and one foot out about this. You're either fully committed to trusting the system (in return for what could potentially be good pay) or you just don't participate at all. Violating anyone's privacy isn't in the cards here. There's no reason you can't disclose this.  There's even every opportunity to make sure that the cameras are only recording when it's reasonable to do so.  "I have security cameras all around my house for the protection of my family, myself, and my property.  These cameras will be recording before you arrive. When you enter your primary access code on any of the entry doors, these cameras will be turned off automatically.  Similarly, if you lock the doors, they will be turned back on.  This is as much for me, as it is for you - any damages that occur while you away will thus be recorded and will not be held against you unless they are the result of your negligence (e.g. a vase falling over after you leave because you balanced it on the edge of a table).   If for any reason you do not wish the cameras to be recording when you leave the house - perhaps you are leaving your teenage kids behind but don't want them recorded - enter your primary code on the lock instead of the regular lock button; this will lock the door and leave the cameras off.   If you appreciate your security as much as I do mine, you may also opt to have the cameras remain recording after entering the home by entering your secondary access code instead.   The cameras can also manually be turned on and off at any time through the guest web portal.  See our welcome guide, available to you in the entrance hallway, for details." Had a group of friends this happened to earlier in the year, about 12 people rented a large house for a celebration (people traveled out of state for this) and they found hidden cameras all over the house needless to say they didn't feel much like celebrating after that and couldn't make a short notice switch for the party since they needed a house around the same size with a large kitchen for food prep. Not sure how they ended up handling it but I would have raised holy hell if it were me.  Steal the cameras.  What would the owner do?  Report that they had hidden cameras taken out of the tenant bedrooms? This. I'd steal the camera every time. Wipe them, place on eBay, enjoy the rental you already paid for.  The person renting it to you has no recourse as they can't report their hidden cameras as stolen to AirBnB or Police because it would implicate them in a worse crime.  Reminds me of this scene on COPS   https://youtu.be/_JkwZUk3Kng (1 minute) What a quirky little ecosystem. Think I'd prefer to file civil and criminal charges vs getting to keep a few cameras. Steal some cameras and do nothing else? They'll just buy more cameras and do the same thing to their next victims.  During my trip to Europe this summer one of my hosts somehow knew that I had switched my train ticket to an earlier time. I never mentioned it to them because I was going to be out long before checkout time. Then the cleaning lady showed up 3 hrs before my original checkout time, right as I was leaving for my train. Got on the phone with my host and he somehow knew I was on the 1030am train instead of the 2pm train. As soon as he mentioned it he started backpedaling and told the cleaning lady to leave immediately. Can't prove it but they either had cameras in the place or they were monitoring my internet usage, either way, creepy as hell.  This is why I always fluff my junk a bit before I take it out in air bnbs. Cant be looking small for the cameras  Anyone recommend a wand or something that you can sweep a room for cameras with? Hitachi wand would do the job 100% best buy we've made this year. Oooh, is it like a fun Harry Potter thing? My kids would love that!  Bug hunting is a pain in the ass. You might be able to use some kind of sweeper that is tuned to the frequency of the CMOS power converter or something. Whatever is noisiest on the camera chip.  I don't think there's anything publicly available. I'll continue brazenly making coffee topless in my unscreened bnb room. Because honestly, even if they post the footage online, with billions of hours of hardcore porn videos out there, what are the chances someone I know will click on "Topless Girl Makes Shitty Hotel Coffee" filmed from a fixed, probably out of focus, angle.  "Fat dude stumbles around in the dark for 5 minutes"    No easy way to sweep for battery powered or plugged devices that record to a memory card. At least not as a civilian.  It could literally be inside a stereo or even the cable box. If it's not transmitting wirelessly you aren't going to find it with a wand.   Yeah novel covert implants can be really hard to detect. [Like this famous one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thing_(listening_device)) You can use an IR camera to find the ones that work in the dark. You can use your phone camera  to find those. Turn off the lights, turn on your camera, look for the light source. If you point a TV remote at your phone camera you can see the IR light when you press the button. My girlfriend and I found one. The only way it got found was because she saw the colored reflection on the lense and recognized it from my FPV drones. It's a little $20 Aomway camera from Hobbyking. I'd post pictures, but there's an ongoing investigation right now.  I would immediately lose my shit. Was the person in the same house when it happened? The couple times I’ve been in an Airbnb, the homeowner was also on property for a good amount of my visit. I would think for those that partake in this voyeur, it’s more of a complete residence rental rather than just a room.  Since, you can't post a picture of the camera, [allow me.](https://alexnld.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Aomway-700TVL-HD-13-CMOS-FPV-Mini-Camera-170-Degree-Wide-Angle-Lens-Module-Dupont-Plug-PALNTSC-Format_nologo_600x600.jpeg) Friend of mine is the "student" mentioned here: http://www.news.com.au/national/crime/multimillionaire-slumlord-masaaki-imaeda-sentenced-for-secret-suburban-sex-lair-where-he-spied-on-tenants/news-story/1461e44f598b6164fb44fb98f6bbb78a  She was oblivious to the whole thing until police had her come down to give a statement and confirm her identity on the recordings. Creeeeeeeepy people are more numerous than we want to believe.  The place next door to me is an AirBnB.  Accordingly, I named my wifi network "airbnb_hidden_cam" Move over "fbi_surveillence_van". You've got one that actually approaches believability. I wouldn't expect the FBI to be that dumb, but I could definitely see some "gotta protect my stuff" Airbnber being dumb enough to call their spycam a spycam.  (On a related note, I need to rename my travel router "rm218_spycam".) It was "WeCanHearYouFucking" when I lived in a 20 unit apartment a few years back.  Initially it was targeted at a particular neighbor, but I kept it after a new network showed up.  It was named "SorryAboutTheNoise."  Incidentally, the building got quieter. Check every bathroom that isn't your own. Also check your own bathroom in case you placed any hidden cameras to spy on yourself. First Airbnb i stayed at had one, my friend who stayed along with us was always paranoid about them and I thought he was crazy.  Sure enough he found one behind the DVD player facing the couch, and right past that was the master bedroom bed that would be viewable with the doors open.  Nice little place on the river in Glenwood Springs CO.  If this happens to you don't call Airbnb. Call the police and then call a lawyer. Im currently staying in an airbnb right now with my so... I should probably check pornhub amateur section. I thought that was a typo for “son” at first and was very worried.  I pitty the poor person that gets a video of me in the buff. It'll look like a grizzly escaped from the zoo.  Whats more offensive, that someone puts a camera in your AirBNB, or that when you find it you realize they already deleted the video? Creepy. Why are people so horrible? No idea. Let's check the cameras and find out. I run an airbnb from the spare room in my apt.  I put a dark activated night light in the bathroom-for. Convenience.  It helps in a dark place you yave never been before. It has a little glass light sensor that happens to point towards the shower.  I have had multiplw guests unplug it and put it under a towel- I suppose they were being paranoid it was a camara.  Also, nothing new. Conventional Landlords/maintenance workers/hotel owners have all been guilty of the voyouer. I am not excusing it, it's just not airbnb specific or something new with airbnb. To make them feel safe, consider putting a sign near it. Something like this:  "TOTALLY NORMAL NIGHTLIGHT. NOTHING TO SEE HERE. NO REASON TO UNPLUG." If multiple people have been creeped out by your nightlight why do you keep putting it back in? Why not remove or replace it?  In the Soviet bloc, it was routine for hotel rooms used by Westerners to be bugged for sound and video. Useful potential blackmail material.  Even happened to James Bond (although that was in Istanbul) You mean Constantinople?  Man, you know that ain’t YOUR business... This is why I always set off an EMP whenever I stay anywhere. Yep. I recently posted this little gem.    &gt;  I recently stayed at a AirBnB in Boston for a family wedding. The owner of the house had a bottle of Louis XIII on display in the dining room. Despite the fact that it was an expensive house, the bottle display just seemed ridiculous. So I looked around, and noticed the small camera pointed at the bottle hidden in a small display statue. I wanted to fuck with it, but ended up just pulling the un-sealed top to give it a smell. It was obviously very cheap cognac. I thought Hennessy VS. I took a whif, then gave the finger to the camera.   &gt;  When we gave the keys back, the home owner said he saw me messing with his bottle of Louis. And I told him I knew it wasn’t Louis. And then I was kind of rude to him in response. He kind of tried to laugh it off, while admitting it was fake and “just a gag.” But I got the feeling that he used it as a ruse to overcharge guests that may have touched it without knowing it wasn’t real.    That really seems like some shady form of baiting, and depending on where it was, there may be laws against it.  Did u report him for having a camera????????? So when you check into your room, the new procedure should be, set the room temperature, unpack your clothes, check room for hidden cameras?  Yes, but the first thing to do, before you bring your suitcase into the room, is check for bed bugs.  Then your list... There's a CA statute which says it's illegal to film or record without consent where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy  I’m pretty certain that’s illegal in all 50 states Yeah, but in California, it is also known to cause cancer.  And you have to have your emissions checked. It is, but the definition of "reasonable expectation of privacy" varies from state to state seriously? a fuckin iphone just sitting there?  that's next level dumb. "Hehehe, for the next 4 hours I'll get a great show until the battery dies!" Their logo is a ball sack and people are surprised there are people spying on yours?  I like to think of it as an opened up paper clip &gt; In June, a German tourist settled with Airbnb for an undisclosed amount after allegedly finding a hidden "remote-controlled camera" at a property in California.   &gt; Hilden said while Airbnb refunded her for the Switzerland stay, and reimbursed her for other travel expenses, she still felt it wasn't enough.    This is so stupid, sue the person who put the cameras up, not AirBnB. This is why we can't have nice things. To the extent Airbnb represents that the listings they have have been vetted and are safe, then they put themselves on the hook for legal liability. Sort of similar to how lyft and Uber, despite referring to their drivers as independent contractors, expose themselves to liability by representing that they background check their drivers to ensure safety. If they both put a big disclaimer on their site that says hey you’re totally doing this shit at your own risk, they’d have a much better position legally. But then, not nearly as many people would feel comfortable using their services.  Shut up and let me watch you pee. AirBnB do hold some responsilbility as it was rented through them as a service.   Issue with a lot of these new businesses like this they want the money without any of the responsibly or regulatory commitments. If someone commits a crime using their service they should be just as accountable.  See also: kickstarter et al.  Project gets funded for $100,000.  kickstarter takes their 5% (or whatever it is now) for $5,000.  Project ends up being a scam.  kickstarter absolves themselves of all responsibility and will tell you to go sue the person who ran the project.  The fact that they profited off of the scam is, as far as they're concerned, moot.  The only reason those platforms have for trying to keep bad projects, bad home owners, bad drivers off of their service is to make sure that public opinion doesn't sway too hard against them.  They don't want to become known as 'that place that has scammers'.  But if a few slip through - even if that's because they're only trying just hard enough to prevent that public opinion scenario - that's alright; it's just profits to them. AirBnB is also responsible.  They are offering a service and acting as the distributor, they have a responsibility to make sure the service they're offering is legitimate.  The lack of responsibility AirBnB has evidenced so far, their incredibly shitty corporate practices, and what AirBnB has done to the availability of housing in many cities are all reasons why I will never use their services and will continually fight against them. I'll be checking the smoke detectors from now on. How do you fit a phone into one of those? And the CO detector, and the radon detector, for chrissake.  A lot of these are fucking amateurs.  With shit like [these](https://www.amazon.com/Corprit-Hidden-600TVL-Covert-Security/dp/B074SMM191) most folks wont even know when to look and what to look for.  Buying a digital device detector the video mentions might be your best bet. I have a friend who says this is why they will never stay at an air bnb. For me, it's still not a good enough reason to go back to staying in hotels. Maybe I have no modesty.  cameras are found in hotels all the time though... Yeah where do people think they were putting the cameras before there was airBnB? Yeah, I don't want to say "who cares," but never doing things because you are that paralyzed by fear seems way worse than someone having a pixelated video of my hairy asshole while I hump my wife.   Yeah - about that- can you guys flip?
 I live in Farmington, and was driving to Aztec on my way up North for work when this happened.  Found out about it from my son's School in Farmington going on lockdown.  The amount of people driving at high speed from Farmington to Aztec, assumably parent's trying to pick up kids... It was quite heartbreaking.  I'm in Aztec and have a sister in school here. Thank everything she was in her main school and not the highschool today, same with my brothers girlfriend. His girlfriends sister is unaccounted for though which is terrifying. Any news on his girlfriend's sister? Not among the dead or wounded, but unaccounted for. May have ditched today. Well, I guess I couldn't be too angry in that case.  In Farmington High, the lockdown started around 8:40 and ended around 11. Tension was high.  I go to PV. The events of today was just so...tense.  Piedre Vista, a HS in Farmington (12 miles away from Aztec), for non-locals. Yes, but having friends and members of the community that go to Aztec was still one of the most frightening experiences of my life as our schooled was threatened over the past few weeks. And the rumors of attacks happening at our school was terrifying. I feel awful for those that had to go through the events at Aztec  I'm in Aztec. I graduated last year so a lot of the people are my friends. We are a very small town. Everyone kind of knows each other. Can't go anywhere without running into someone you know. Casey Jordan and  Paco Fernandez. I didn't personally know any of them but Casey's mom is a close family friend. We gave her our graduation decorations for Casey so she could save some money. My moms co-workers were all at the police station or wherever when a police man came to her and took her away into a room. Everyone heard her screaming when they told her that her daughter wasnt okay. The locked down all the schools in the area and bussed all the AHS kids to McGee park to reunite with parents. Caseys mom didn't get go go to the park to pick up her kid today. My sister said she knew her. My sister had to go take a psychology final right after finding out she died at the college. All my friends are devastated. They recently confirmed that it was another student who was the shooter. One of us. Its nice to see everyone come together though. I've never seen our school united so quickly. Once a Tiger, always a Tiger. Stay strong people. We are trying our best. Sorry if my grammar or spelling is off. I'm talking to so many different people right now.  Dont really have time to make sure everything is 100% right. Thanks for the support. Love you all I’m from Farmington and my brother is a cop there, this kind of news is like a punch to the gut. There are always people impacted by these things, it sucks when it hits close to home.  My cousin is a police officer over in Bloomfield, he got called to aztec to help out when it happened. I've never been so worried.  Please remember: most info in the first hour is likely off and will be revised. Fox news reported "2 dead" within the first 30 minutes with no citation of sources, meanwhile everyone else was still saying "multiple injured." That's the kind of reporting that really grinds my gears. Scaring people senseless with no proof at the time of the information. Well it’s looks like they were right so...  You still need to say where the info came from if there is no other source posting it though. This is news coming to terrified parents who worry if their child is dead or alive, giving info like that is reckless without sources. I don't know why you're being downvoted. The media is a joke. Exploit human emotions for higher CTR's resulting in higher CPMs for their shitty inventory. Journalism is dead.  Hey guys, I'm a local. Please keep us in your thoughts and prayers. 3 confirmed dead, 14 wounded. One shooter dead.  My sister lives in Farmington and works in Aztec. She luckily doesn't have any kids but is very worried for her coworkers. Stay strong friend &lt;3 I have family in school here. My sister bounces between the middle and highschool for classes. Thank the gods she was at the middle school today. Brother's girlfriend was at the college instead, but her sister we can't find any info on. I hope she is okay. I'm very glad to hear your immediate family is alright. Pm me if you need to talk. She's not among the wounded or dead. She may have ditched today. Oh man I hope so. Thanks for the good news update. Yeah, in this case, no news is good news. I don't understand why this is sitting at the bottom of /r/news. We are so used to it unfortunately.  That's sad to just think about. seriously. idk if this will make the front page how fucked up is that.  Because shootings are normal now. This is considered acceptable and not a big deal.  Anything with less than 10 deaths won't even make the national news. Weird. It's a top story on Google News. Sorry this thread isn't getting enough upvotes to your satisfaction. Clearly no one cares about gun violence because Reddit News hasn't moved this story higher up on the list.  Would be national coverage for over a week in any other developed country. I had to search "New Mexico" and sort by top/hour to find this thread. Nothing confirmed yet, those are just the numbers floating around. Local schools in preventative lockdown. College is still open. Police are maintaining visible presence at all local schools.   Aztec police are handing investigation to State and FBI.  Edit: 3 Confirmed. No other reported injuries (1:01PM). The police have confirmed the 3 and 14 here locally.  Yep, AP confirms.  Shooter is also dead. http://www.koat.com/article/active-shooter-reported-at-aztec-high-school/14380005 yeah Source it... cause I work in the media here and we do NOT have confirmation numbers. From family on scene and in the school, https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aztec-new-mexico-high-school-shotin_us_5a29652be4b0b185e539e866  and a local media outlet with a more recent update http://www.koat.com/article/active-shooter-reported-at-aztec-high-school/14380005 Thank you. I'm also seeing the AP report. We're on the phone with State Police now confirming.  https://apnews.com/3621148a4443499788a38c2dcbe235ec  Edit: Just confirmed 3 dead, including shooter. No other reported injuries. For legal purposes, I am not an official reporter, just passing on what I'm hearing from multiple sources.  Also, per the SO, students can be picked up from McGee Park at noon. This actually coming from a deputies mouth.  I wouldn't have sourced shit with that miserable attitude There's nothing wrong with demanding sources. Fear mongering does nothing to help, and repeating hearsay is fear mongering.  He's right, though. It could be read as terse. If that was the case, I apologize. It's been a... brain fog sort of morning. :/  Edit: smiley to slanty. i don't feel like smiling. i just did it out of habit.  We're all angry and upset here man. I'm at the point of beating someone over the head myself.  Hard to wholeheartedly smile when tragedy strikes like this. Especially at your own home, it seems. Small towns seem to have the hardest hitting impact when there's so much kinship. My strongest sympathies to you lot. They're not telling us who is gone... but one of my friends, who is a teacher there, has reported in, so that's good. It's gonna be a hard night for all of us, especially so for the families who aren't getting good news. :( I forgot where I heard/read but I believe the families of the deceased have already been informed. I don't want to imagine what those families will deal with being informed their child was killed at a place that should always feel safe. You don't need to apologize.  You have no time in your line of work on a day like this to write overly worded, super nice requests for sources. http://www.koat.com/article/active-shooter-reported-at-aztec-high-school/14380005 and here's the local news source for you all. http://www.koat.com/article/active-shooter-reported-at-aztec-high-school/14380005 I don't understand why this is sitting at the bottom of /r/news. Hardly news anymore in the US Small town, mostly, I imagine. A lot of mass shootings are It's up there now. 3 dead. No injuries. Police had a response time of under a minute. Its a good thing their station is only a couple blocks away Are the dead people students? The victims names are as of yet being withheld, but at least one was a shooter. Love from CA. It's awful to hear about the deceased, and I hope the wounded recover soon. Sorry if it’s been already updated but they just showed the press conference with the governor and local law enforcement and they said there were no other injuries beyond the two student fatalities.   Sending love from Albuquerque  ABQ Journal is saying no one other than the deceased are injured.  That's nice, both my first responder brother and the local news says otherwise. Posted sources below.  ABQ Journal is local as well just trying to figure out what right, this is directly from their article  &gt; Reports had circulated earlier that 15 had been injured, but State Police said no there were no other injuries. My mom works a block away and watched them medivac wounded herself, as well.  Abq is 200 miles away. It's KOB and DT up here.  KOAT and KRQE are all saying state PD said no other injuries.   kob even says it isn't confirmed, &gt;15 others are injured, according to a statement by the Navajo Nation Office of the President and Vice President. However, state police officials have not confirmed that.  Not trying to argue just hoping less people are hurt Me too, man. Me too. But both my mom and brother were there, and both saw/dealt with wounded. As shitty as it is, hoping it was the fatalities being taken out. But... that's not what my brother was saying. Here's the Daily Times (local newspaper) story: http://www.daily-times.com/story/news/local/aztec/2017/12/07/school-shooting-aztec-high-school/930793001/ Why do more and more kids these days feel the need to grab a gun and kill a bunch of their classmates? Why don't they just point the gun at themselves instead of taking out innocent people with it? That's the million dollar question that everyone has been asking for decades since mass killings started at schools in America.  Probably the stigma that comes with getting help for mental illnesses and all of the bullying that follows so kids bottle it up and never seek help and explode. Not to mention access to quality mental healthcare is terrible - over half the psychiatrists in the country don’t even take insurance. There’s not enough beds in hospitals. That’s not even getting to patient compliance and recovery.  Costs are a huge barrier, even for me. With insurance, a monthly appointment will cost $45, plus meds (luckily generic) at $10. If I added weekly therapy, which I should, that’s an additional $40/week. Now imagine someone not in a stable place, not having a steady income trying to manage that..  They want the satisfaction of killing those that hurt them before they go out. A lot of it has to do with mental illness as well. I don't think there's anything that would drive a sane person to shoot innocent people. It probably has to do with bullying. Schools often don't take bullying seriously enough and parents believe that sending letters to the school is either enough to help or they tell their kids it is a normal part of life.   How do underage kids keep getting their hands on guns despite the epidemic of school shootings? That's the real question if you ask me. Either people aren't taking proper care of their firearms or more and more criminal dealers are approaching youths.  They're trying to express contempt for existence, and the darkest way to do that is to shoot someone whose extremely innocent, in a way that will get them the most coverage.  An alternate theory is they blame the population at large for their issue. They have a specific target who's driven them to this point, and blame the rest for ignoring/enabling the abuse. A few reasons (or combination of):  - They want to take out those they feel are responsible for their own suffering.  - They know they won't have to face responsibility/justice for their actions.  - They want others to feel their pain and suffering.  - They can't see the value in life as others around them do. In essence, their perceived existence is the same as any other...meaningless. The same reason why terrorists attack ice cream stores instead of political targets.   1. Because the targets are easy attach a sense of malevolence towards. If you're in school you feel aggression, envy, etc towards your peers or happy people in general.   2. Grouped together, not secured. There's a whole bunch of people and not many people around to do anything about it.  3. Shock factor,   4. Imitation factor- these school shooters know they'll get more attention for killing a bunch of kids that opening fire on a cross walk. It also sets them in a group of their "peers".      They are solving their problems the way they have seen others solve their problems, with violence. Crime, military, police, movies, music, video games, pop culture, books, magazines, news papers, everywhere you look, people are using violence to solve issues. Society as a whole is violent as fuck then we ask ourselves why people do these kinds of things. We live in a profoundly sick society and few people want to confront the atomization, narcissism, nihilism, and futility people growing up now get steeped in.  The talking heads will talk about drugs, guns, "mental illness", but that's not quite it. Negative culture around mental health + glorification of violence in popular culture and identification of masculinity with violence + easy access to guns This is one of the schools I work with. I was just there a couple weeks ago. I thought it was a really nice school and the students were great to work with. I'm just shocked. This kinda of thing can really happen anywhere and the worst part is it seems like it's happening more often.  I've become so numb to shooting that this doesn't phase me at all. It's realkly telling how 'normalize' this all is when it's not Major breaking news.   Edit: spelling I live in Farmington and goes to high school here, although I didn't expirience the shooting I did see the affect that it had on people at my school, it all felt weird, because you don't expect something this tragic to happen near you, one of my friends had a friend in Aztec high school that unfortunately passed away today Shootings like these are just another daily reminder of our superior culture  who did it and why? We dont know who did it until the investigation wraps up hopefully tomorrow. All my friends figured out who died. The whole school kinda just messaged everyone until we knew who it was. Casey and Paco. Casey is the daughter of one of my moms friends. Police won't tell us who it is for sure that died but we already figured it out. Still dont know who the shooter was. At least I dont. More info will come as the investigation gets more underway and wraps up tomorrow hopefully. I'm glad all my friends are okay. Once a tiger, always a Tiger. So, are we ready to talk about gun control yet?    edit: too soon, thoughts and prayers, our hearts are with the victims, no one saw this coming, etc.     Edit 2: Lol, brigaded as fuck. Where did I get linked? Would love to read your comments. Post was only 3 minutes old when this comment was posted.  You need some control I expect to see these same comments when a Muslim terrorist attack happens then, right? Well the thoughts and prayers from the last time this happened didn't keep the kids at this HS alive and well today did it?  As sad as this whole thing is. Right. Thoughts and prayers. A heartfelt tweet. Those are more important. Ya, fuck him for bringing up the biggest issues as they happen.  When IS the right time to talk about it?  Not during a tragedy, not after... So we just ignore it forever?  I see this as a problem with violence, not a problem with guns.  But go for it, what would you prescribe? If you can suggest a law that doesn't sound totally fucking stupid (ex: ban all guns!), a law that doesn't punish 99.9% of law-abiding citizens because of the actions perpetuated by a few, a law that doesn't break the "due process" part of the Constitution, then we might come to an agreement.  It's a problem with BOTH.  We have a problem with mental health AND a problem with guns.  It doesn't have to be one or the other.. we've got issues across the board.  I agree it doesn't have to be one or the other, I think there's lots of gun control that even the hardest NRA members could get behind (and they have). They don't want bad guys having guns any more than you do.   Problem is, we know what most of the gun control you would suggest looks like. You may not have been here for it, but we've had this conversation many times before you decided to join in. We've been having it for over 20 years already. When bad things with gun happens, politicians will scramble over each other to see who can be the first to pass a sexy new law that bans a plastic attachment... and their constituents will love them for it because.... like Ralph Wiggum, they get to pat themselves on the back and say, "I'm helping!"  I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt here to not just assume you're going to repeat the same 12 tired, talking points. So I'll ask again, what would you prescribe to fix the gun issue? Ban all mentally ill, confiscate them and lock them away.  Why aren't you for that?   Because that's a terrible idea? The mentally ill need health services.. not isolation and punishment.   I agree   And the 299,998,000 guns owned by US citizens not ever used in crimes shouldnt be confiscated either  "When" is when you come up with some real answers for the issue at hand instead of moaning about "assault weapons" (when rifles have the smallest amount of deaths attributed to them), concealed carry laws (when conceal carry owners are some of the most law abiding people studies), buybacks (which either don't accomplish anything in studies or are just your way of saying mandatory confiscation)  or anything else that isn't EXACTLY mental health (for suicides which make up most deaths) and urban poverty (that is connected to most homicides).  When your side does that, without an ulterior motive, there will be progress. Oh please.  He's not a politician or a law maker.  It's not his job to come up with the ideas.  It's his job as a citizen to express his concern on the issue to his representatives, who in turn, do fucking nothing about it. Go for it. What “common sense” gun control would you like to talk about.   Edit: still waiting for him to respond to me to talk about it. Still nothing. Replied to others with snarky comments but no real discussion. Looks like a troll. Possibly Russian?  Anytime someone argues with you, simply say “what do YOU think they should do? How do you think it could be made better?” and 9 times out of 10 the arguer will have no clue what they actually want You’re right. He wants to ban gun mods like barrel shroud or stocks. Dude is nuts.  I would LOVE it if you could quote me on that. Don't keep me waiting though. You called me a Russian troll because I didn't respond within 2 minutes. Lmao I replied.  Bolt actions and revolvers.  Muzzleloading marshmallow guns What about marshmallow bow and arrow? Drive by comments, so useful don't you think? I mean, we don't know motives, the type of weapon used, or how the shooter got his gun. Its silly to figure out what would've stopped this when we don't know what started it.   What legislation would have prevented this?  I like how you think your stupid comments matter enough for people to “brigade you.”  Normally I'd agree with you, but seeing as a legitimate discussion I was having with someone got heavily downvoted, I can only assume a brigade. Been long enough on reddit to notice the patterns, mate. First we should talk about parenting  Do we really trust the average parent to parent? I don't think it's gone so well in the past. “Are we ready to talk about car control yet?” “Are we ready to talk about alcohol control yet?” “Are we ready to talk about cigarette control yet?”  I get it, you’re looking for a place to put the guilt, but it’s not that simple Sure it is.. you're just not willing to make a compromise.    You don't want a compromise, you want to ban and confiscate all guns.    Sorry no deal  Did I say that at all ever?  Those were your words.. I don't think we should ban all guns, that's just stupid..  You're now just projecting your fears.. instead of having a real conversation.  Gun owners have given up a LOT in the last 70 years:  * 1934 National Firearms Act  * Registration of short barrels, automatic guns, suppressors * 1968 Gun Control Act  * Can't sell guns across state lines. * 1986 Hughes Amendment  * Closed the 1934 registry to machine guns. No more automatic weapons sold at all commercially. * 1993 Brady Bill  * Mandatory waiting period to buy a gun. Mandatory background check. * 1994 Assault Weapons Ban  * Banned cosmetic features which were easily circumvented. Expired in 2004.  When are we going to get any of this rolled back? Most of the laws listed above aren't really stopping any crime, so if they're ineffective can we just get rid of them?  Here's a few things gun owners want:  * National concealed carry so we can carry our guns for person protection while we travel to visit family, jobs, etc. * National "buy/own any guns you want as long as you don't murder someone, including automatics, short barrel rifle/shotguns, etc." * Gun suppressors removed from NFA registry so we can shoot quieter. Reduces noise pollution, helps protect hearing. Suppressors were only banned because people were using them to poach during the great depression to feed their families. * Private access to background checks to validate private buyers aren't felons/dangerous. * Faster appeals process so that anyone denied on background checks can get answers quickly and sort things out. Very often denials are clerical errors, but it takes lawyers and $10k+ and  years of your life to get the FBI to talk to you and get things set straight. They're currently processing appeals from late 2015 last I heard.  Jesus lol.. Honestly everything you've listed is a good thing..  And all the thing that gun owners want are seriously illogical and should be shot down.   We've got the worst problem with guns and gun deaths in the world.. we're the only country dealing with this level of violence.  SO.. i think maybe we should continue regulations.. and probably ramp them up.    &gt; SO.. i think maybe we should continue regulations.. and probably ramp them up.  Have you ever tried to purchase a gun legally in California? LA County? How should we ramp up regulations? Like what specifically?  About 60% of gun deaths in the US are suicide, so the number is already inflated to seem more problematic than it is. Are those people killing themselves because they have guns, or for other mental issues? Less than 1% of gun deaths are accidental. Of the remaining gun deaths, a large majority of the perpetrators are not using legal guns and not carrying legally.   &gt;We've got the worst problem with guns and gun deaths in the world  Well that's definitely not true. Brazil, where guns are restricted to people aged 25+ and pretty much only restricted to your house (no open or conceal carry unless you are law enforcement), their gun death rate is double that of the US. Have you looked at where gun deaths are most prevalent in the United States?   Just how much research about gun laws, gun safety and gun crime statistics have you done yourself? You mentioned that laws and regulations should be put into place, but are you really fully educated on what laws already exist?    You know ARs in Canada can be any length. They can have a SBR without any paperwork. They can also have a sawed off shotgun and it's 100% legal. You do that in the US you would be lucky to not get 25 years in club fed. &gt; We've got the worst problem with guns and gun deaths in the world.. we're the only country dealing with this level of violence.  That is completely incorrect.  Automatic weapons are largely made inaccessible and since then you rarely see them used in crime; I wonder why 🤔 Because there are only 182,619 transferrable machine guns, ranging from $14k to north of $200k. Exactly.  I'm not suggesting we follow the same path for semi automatics (I own many myself), but it would seem that the strategy did work over time; if not to remove them from circulation but at the very least to prevent further saturation, no? Where is this mandatory waiting period? I never waited more than an hour. Also nothing illegal about selling interstate. We do it all the time. The mandatory waiting period existed between 1993 and 1998. The bill required the setup of an instant background check system, and the waiting period was a half-step while we waited on the FBI to build NICS.  You cannot sell a gun to a resident of another state. You need to have an FFL (federal firearms licensed seller) to run a background check and act as a middle man for interstate transactions. https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/docs/0501-firearms-top-10-qaspdf/download Yeah of course you go through a dealer. I do for all transactions. Who said this? Not anyone here. It's never a compromise. When was the last time the pro-gun people got anything out of a "compromise"? Oh my god, you're acting like a child lol    Really? That's what you consider acting like a child? shh let the bodies cool before you push your agenda Funny how that's never the case when there's a Muslim terrorist attack. It's "ban them all now!"  Or when something happens with an illegal immigrant it's "build the wall!" Hmmm, I think you're undermining your own argument here. Clearly you don't agree with the stuff President Trump does, so are you saying this because you would agree with gun owners that making cuts to Constitutional liberties in the emotional aftermath of national tragedies is a bad idea? I mean, shit, that's how we got the Patriot Act. That's also why we imprisoned Japanese-Americans after Pearl Harbor.   If you're just looking for another way to say, "Fuck Trump", ok fine, but otherwise it sounds like you agree that the Constitution should definitely be looked to as a support in times of tragedy, and not as if it's an obstacle I never made an argument, I think you're wrongfully assuming I'm OP.   I'm merely commenting on the hypocrisy of people (usually conservatives) who always love to say it's "too soon" to talk about these things after a tragedy. But as soon as something that aligns with their political ideology occurs, there is no such thing as too soon.   I never mentioned Trump specifically, I just used those examples because it's low hanging fruit. It's stuff you see in every comment thread on every social media or message board.   I actually don't support many gun regulations at all. I just find it absurd that it's always "let the bodies cool" for gun control but as soon as something with a Republican talking point comes up people are ready to have these conversations while the bodies are still laying in the street. &gt; But as soon as something that aligns with their political ideology occurs, there is no such thing as too soon.   This is just a fucking stupid way to frame a conversation and it's all too easy to turn around. If I wanted to use low-hanging fruit I could talk about the *numerous* times Democrats wanted to ban guns or even a subsection of them, saying, "Pfft, fuck the Constitution. It's old and I disagree with it and I want people to be safe!"   But when Trump wants to put a temporary hold on immigrants from dangerous countries they say, He can't do that! It's unconstitutional!"  So let's just state the obvious that there is a sea of opinions out there and if I needed to find one thing, *anything* to reinforce my personal bias against one group then I could do that easily. So let's not be stupid and open up that gate? Yea, inevitably other people are going to do that, but that doesn't necessitate that you have to stoop down to it either.   When it's a Islamic terrorist attack it's OMG the islamaphobia is sooooo bad right now  Let’s just wait until the next shootings, so we can say its too soon again. Of course, that's the usual excuse. And after the thoughts and prayers have been distributed, out comes the "this is not the time to discuss" excuse.  The desire to prevent further shootings is an *agenda*. Yikes, this country is in a very bad place at the moment.  Did we break a record? I think that the last mass shooting happened around 2 weeks ago. Progress from the weekly basis. Watching American news make me feel so lucky that i live in Germany. America is somewhere between a developed western nation and Honduras. The news you see online doesnt reflect daily life at all. In reality we live in a pretty sweet ass place. The news is always super blown out of proportion. Just so you know I wouldn't call mass shootings on a regular basis, some involving kids, blowing things out of proportion. The worst bit is you think it's normal. No we defiantly have crazy amounts. I mean the news in general. I dont live my life freaking out about something that is all over the news. Day to day life isn't as crazy as its made out to be. We all go to work and lead normal lives for the most part. Comparing the US to Honduras isn't accurate at all. It is pretty creepy having a shooting at the school I just graduated from. All my friends are meeting at football fields and parks to mourn. We will heal and grow stronger over time. Things like these happen. Life will return to usual not too long from now. We are a small town. Not much like this happens where we are so normal everyday life is actually pretty chillaxed. Usually its pretty well known that by the time you graduate college some of the student will die. Some in drunk driving accidents. Things of that nature. My sophomore year one of my best friends committed suicide. A couple years before that a football player was killed in a DD accident. So its been a few years since anything happened. Death is pretty uncommon at our school. I'm just glad there was only 2 dead not including the shooter. We dont know his name yet. They did confirm it was a male in their last conference. No injuries. I'm so glad our police station is only a couple blocks away. Their response time was less than a minute. I think it was another student trying to get vengeance or payback. I'm not sure until they release details after their investigation. Seems to me like you could kill more than 2 people in a minute unless your only goal is to kill those 2 people. I checked on facebook and the 2 victims where indeed friends. I dont know if their is more to the story than that. Information is really hard to nail right now. Everyone is just kinda repeating other people information at the moment. I didn't know either 2 victims. My sister new Casey a little. Her mom and my mom are friends. Her mom owns a  dog grooming business in town and grooms our dogs for free because my mom works for the animal shelter. It has broken our little town but we are putting it back together with cement this time. We are closer than ever.  Also politics are extremely blown out of proportion. Yeah its usually true but no one really seems to talk about politics openly around here. Its just everyone yelling at each other on the internet. Things like that. I think the politics being so crazy makes it easier for people to turn little problems into big ones. Things like that. Just know that normally every day life isn't nearly has chaotic as the news makes it out to be. We are all mostly normal people. Its the crazies that make things seem crazy. Make sense? I've has a rough morning so I'm sorry about any confusion or spelling mistakes and what have you!  Most people don't live their lives freaking out to news, they usually identity a problem and work on a solution if it keeps happening. If it happened to your loved ones you'd likely give it more thought. You only have to look at the top comments in this thread to see what it means when it hits close to home.  My sister has been crying all day. All my friends are in tears. One of my befriends walked past the dead shooter. I dont need you to tell me what hits close to home. I have strong opinions on gun control as it is. We are trying our best trying to get over this. All of us. If you have a problem arguing with people who have literally been dealing with this all day thinking our priorities aren't straight then I have news for you. I live in a very conservative area and hopefully this event will help change peoples minds. Sadly I live in 1 of the 2 counties in my state that are majority republican. The people here can't win a state vote as it is so I'm not too worried about it. Unless you have been in a situation where you have to pick up friends from mcgee park after your old school was just shot up because their parents won't pick up the phone then I dont want to hear your opinion on how I should view gun control. You dont know my stance on gun control until now, dont act like it. I've been going all day just to find out if all my friends are alive and I'd appreciate it if you'd lay the fuck off the politics until tomorrow at least. Ill be there supporting gun control with the rest of you. Right now I'm just glad all my friends are okay. My sister however new Casey somewhat. I think she is okay though. All we want is for people to comfort their family tonight. You never know when they will disappear forever. Have a great fucking afternoon sir.  Btw I am one of those top 5 comments. So I do know exactly what its like   Also if you are not far their is a candle light ceremony thing behind minium park in Aztec at 6. The more the merrier. Even if its only one person. Help spread the love I'm not allowed to have an opinion unless I suffer a tragic experience? I'm sorry to hear about your day but it's up to all of you to work at change if you really want it. If not then more families will have these days. You're not getting what I'm putting down. I dont want to hear your opinion if you have no clue what you are talking about. I know first hand what my little town is going through. I dont want you to tell me what I should do or how I should respond to this incident. Lay the fuck off your "allowed opinion" for ten minutes and let the people grieve. Now if you'll excuse me I have a candle light Virgil to go to. I dont know what a Virgil is but I'm bringing my candle and comforting my town, my family. Same thing I did when my buddy passed a few years ago. The whole town came together. We dont need the outside world  bringing politics in less than 12 hours after people where killed that we were all connected to somehow. Save it for tomorrow when the investigation is shown. Maybe it was a kid who took his dads registered firearm. We dont know yet. Give the people peace while they can still get it. We are all already pissed at how the news portrayed the situation and its only going to get worse as the night goes on.  It's a comment chain on a news story, if you want to grieve I suggest shutting Reddit off and not going to a place where people want to discuss the issue. We're not in a fucking vigil. What better place to put my discussion than a news article where people can hear the opinion of someone who was actually here. Its better than a reporter who was told to say something. I could probably give you better facts than youre hearing in the news if you really want me too. I have friends with videos on fb of it going down. Students hiding behind desks, bulletholes, you name it. You dont see that in the news articles yet dont you? &gt; Watching American news make me feel so lucky that i live in Germany   interesting, I feel the exact opposite  Its called Stockholm Syndrome :) at least we can now fully understand why it's called that... I just hope Germany doesn't get as bad :( The reason that Sweden has so many "rape" incidents is due to its very wide legal definition of rape. Its also because in Sweden the vast majority of victims report the incidents (something that doesnt happen in US, which has a low report rate)   You cant find these info with just a quick wiki [search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_statistics#United_States) I'm happy you live in Germany too. *typed from my iPad while being dragged under the axel of a jihadist's truck. The perception that you Trump supporters have for Europe is laughably false. I dont even know how you can believe this bs  &gt; The perception that you Trump supporters have for Europe is laughably false.  Said the European who thinks the United States sits "somewhere between a developed western nation and Honduras."   Holy hypocrisy.  Having grown up in the UK and lived in France and Switzerland and now the US, I can safely say that yes, the US is somewhere between a developed nation and Honduras.  While he's a little ridiculous, have you seen video footage of the highways through France? Google the Calais route for some information. [deleted] Well seeing as it was a kid he/she wasn't suppose to have a gun in the first place.........  It was probably the parents gun and they didn't properly secure it. No law could've stopped this if that was the situation. How about laws requiring guns to be properly secured? They already exist. Not in New Mexico. Not feasible. Too many guns, not enough cops.  Another day, another incident of gun violence in America ...  Can the U.S. ban guns already? This is ridiculous.... Australia did it and it works really well.  If we do ban guns would you be the one to go door to door taking them? Because anyone who took that job wouldn't have long to live. Naw, he's going to send another young man with a family and full life ahead of him to go confiscate all the guns. But hey, the real win here is that u/dj2short feels better. Do you actually have any idea on how that would work (and undoubtedly fail) or do you think someone snaps their fingers, and they go away? This is idiotic.  Can we talk about banning free speech already? This is ridiculous. If people didn't say mean things to the kid he wouldn't have felt the need to act out violently.  Agreed.  Bullying is a direct result of the first amendment.  We need to do away with it for the safety of our children.   Should just do this with every Amendment.  "Can we talk about forcing people to quarter soldiers in their homes already? This is ridiculous. If we had soldiers in people's homes, they wouldn't act out like this"  Ban guns?! Let's ban all crime while we're at it!! Brother, you're asking for a weekly Ruby Ridge scenario with shit like that. Oh yeah, sure, ban all guns. And all those guys who you have made fun of for talking about how the government is going to ban their guns, I'm sure they'll take it real well when you do exactly what they knew you were going to do.  I think the easier solution would be to simply ban murder and crime. If we could make that illegal than we'd all be safe. /s Only if you want a war to break out.  Because things are so great in places line Baltimore and Chicago. No. You’re a fool if you think that can ever happen or hat it would fix anything.  Gun education is extremely important. Even if you’re not going to own one I think everyone should take a basic gun safety class.  And mental health is important. We need to help the people who feel like turning a gun on someone is their only option. These people are sick.  Sure if you personally volunteer to come round them up  Australia has more guns now than it did then. Also the decrease in homicide in Australia since is similar to the rest of the developed world, US included, regardless of the nature of gun legality during the interim.  To do a buyback in the US for our guns would cost, at $100 per gun, roughly $40 *billion* dollars. Frankly given that the government is constitutionally obliged to pay "just compensation", the cost would likely be higher. No, in fact we need to be arming everyone atm. If you don’t have a gun, you need to get one asap, get a rifle and a handgun.
 Don't blame the corporation, they are just exploiting the laws that were put in place by politicians who are owned by shareholders! I thought Trump was stopping this?   If you're believing anything Trump says, there's your first mistake. I mean he did ~~build that wall~~ , ~~lock her up~~ , ~~been too busy to golf~~ , ~~release his taxes~~ , ~~release his findings into Obama's brith certificate~~ , ~~release his healthcare plan where everyone is covered~~ , ~~label China a currency manipulator~~ , ~~brought back jobs~~ , ~~found those 3-5 "illegal" votes against him~~ , ~~ended NAFTA~~ ...  he ended TPP,, and everyone else carried on, so there's that?  hurrah?   &gt; he ended TPP  yeah he ended TPP and inadvertently replaced it with a pro-China one that we aren't included in but everyone else is Well he did recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. So there's that. That's a way way easier promise to accomplish. Also not a smart one apperently which is why no one's done it. &gt;not a smart one apperently  Which is why Congress overwhelmingly voted for it? Congress is your standard for intelligence? What have you accomplished? I had breakfast for two meals today.  &gt; Also not a smart one apperently which is why no one's done it.  Yeah, "no one's done it" isn't usually a great way to know whether or not something is good/smart.  Things can be smart even if no one has done them before.   I have no idea whether or not this is actually a smart idea or not, but your reasoning is stupid.  This is not a smart idea. People in the region are super pissed. Trump's reasoning for the decision was effectively "whatever we've been doing in the past hasn't been working, so let's see if poking everyone in the eye will work..." It wasn't really Trump's idea if the plan was already written out and all he did was not put it on the backburner anymore.    And it's not like what we've been doing has been effective so I'll go ahead and see what we get here.  Just because a plan is written down does not mean it is a good plan. There's a reason it's been put on the back burner for so long.  You probably wouldn't be so cavalier about the consequences of the decision if you lived in the area it will affect. I dunno, maybe you would. "Just because no one's done it doesn't mean it's a dumb idea"   "Well I mean it was already written down so it can't be that dumb an idea"   ಠ_ಠ So if I write down that I'm going to blow up the sun, does that mean its a good idea? People in that region have always been pissed though. So really why keep giving a fuck, what are they gonna do protest more and kill each other.  Ohh nooo mooooslims are mad, better do like the 3 things that do not make them mad. Fine I'll reword it. I think shaking things around in that powder keg of an area is a bad idea. &gt;Yeah, "no one's done it" isn't usually a great way to know whether or not something is good/smart.  We're talking about politicians here though. If you went around doing the exact opposite of what politicians have done for the past 30 years you'd be in pretty good shape.  90-0 was the vote.  Maybe not smart, but it’s what Congress voted for unanimously.   https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-resolution/176/text The Arab world respects strength. What they are trying now is just challenging to see if he is bluffing.  The only out come of this is that leads to peace is Jerusalem as an international city, split like Svalbard. only to inflame the ME again.  classic republican move.  mission accomplished!! Tax reform also about to get done. People keep saying that's going to bring jobs back.  Well not exactly ... What people? And what are you refuting? trump promised no new taxes for the middle class but only the wealthy are getting a huge tax cut.  Middle-class families are still fucked. I’ll be helped along with most everyone I know. I’m not bill gates either. Sounds like you haven’t done your research lol.  that's exactly what someone who has no clue what's happening says because daddy is a republican.    consider the article you're saying this on.    trump also promised better cheaper healthcare for every American.  do you spew that same shit reply to that promise? Are you going to cite any references or just be a dick? &gt;sounds like you haven't done your research.  take your own advice.   The Michigan plant will instead be used for a self driving car with 150 more jobs added in Michigan.  [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/06/ford-makes-room-for-new-self-driving-vehicle-moving-ev-production-to-mexico.html) Trump threatened an import tax on vehicles made by American companies in  foreign counties. Let's see what happens now.  You thought a BUSINESSMAN who is now also a POLITICIAN would keep his promises?  just...lol The only thing Trump has stopped is the ability to achieve an erection  Trump signs laws, congress writes them. Trump is working on this, unlike other presidents who think it's just great to move jobs oversees.   &gt;Trump is working on this  Specifically what is he doing?  &gt;unlike other presidents who think it's just great to move jobs oversees.  Such as? At *worst* this has been passively accepted in the past. &gt; Specifically what is he doing?  Playing golf at Mar-a-Lago.  And, you know, "Golf" is the brand of a car. And we're talking about car jobs here. So, there you go!   You deep-state people will never give up trying to undermine our dear President, will you?? /s &gt; Golf" is the brand of a car.  The name of  a German car that's, I believe, made in Germany by Germans. Also made in Mexico by Mexicans. But that wall will keep them out. Jeepers. Are hondas made in Mexico too? Or do they just use Chinese slavery or? Good chance that your new Honda is either made in Greensburg, IN or Marysville, OH.  I don't have a *new* honda :0( I have an old Acura (0: Love this comment! I have to use the reddit forbidden emojies to show how I feel:  👍 Great point, had to downvote for the /s though. Absolutely kills the joke when you spell it out right after telling it. Don't expect a reply from a Trumpster they have an empty bag of air... During the campaign season Trump was floating ideas of having massive tariffs on imported goods, such as vehicles, to make it more profitable to have manufacturing centers in the US rather than building vehicles outside of the US and then importing. At least to me, floating ideas around during the campaign does not satisfy the definition of "working" in the context of someone who has since taken office. I have not seen any significant push from Trump or the GOP congress to get this done, let alone specifics. The most I've seen is discussion over tariffs on Chinese solar panels. It would be extremely difficult for him to get the GOP on board with having tariffs, as they like free trade, and even the Democrats don't want tariffs. I would expect that there will be a stronger push for tariffs from him during his second and third year in office. &gt; At worst this has been passively accepted in the past.  Sexual assault by powerful people has been passively accepted in the past, what is your point? Wrong is wrong. When Obama or Clinton said that the country wasn't ready for gay marriage, that didn't make it right, that was weak ass leadership. So, again, what is Trump trying to do to stop companies from outsourcing jobs? Yeh but what about OBAMA and CLINTON? Uhhh...what? What part confuses you? That part where Democrats didn't support gay marriage? It's true you know.  The part where gay marriage has something to do with US manufacturing. It's called poor leadership. Poor leadership leads to NAFTA and bad China trade deals. Bad leadership is someone who says they didn't support gay marriage because the country wasn't ready.  You specifically mention:  &gt;other presidents who think it's just great to move jobs oversees.  Which presidents are you talking about?  Not to mention, this isn't like sexual assault. Passively accepting that jobs are going to be outsourced is not necessarily a bad thing, if you believe it'll be more effort than it is worth to keep them here in the first place instead of expanding other industries or investing in things that will create new jobs in the future. If that works or not is an issue that is separate from a president accepting that jobs will be outsourced. &gt; Which presidents are you talking about?  Clinton Started with NAFTA Both Bushes were on board, and Obama seemed to think it was the right move too.  &gt;Passively accepting that jobs are going to be outsourced is not necessarily a bad thing,  Why not? it's almost as if you are making a conscious decision that those vulnerable people aren't worth saving. If you are going to bring in low skilled immigrants into this country, you need to have low skilled jobs available for them. It is not good policy to move low skilled jobs out of the country and bring in low skilled people. &gt; Trump signs laws, congress writes them.  Presidents are fully capable of writing legislation and asking Congress to pass it. &gt;Trump is working on this, unlike other presidents who think it's just great to move jobs oversees.  By making sure his ties are made in China, or tweeting at Nordstrom for not selling his daughter's overseas made crap?  Or is it the golfing?  is the golfing helping?   &gt; Trump is working on this  Trump isn't working on shit but fattening his own pockets. Anyone who believes differently is a fucking idiot. Didn't we just give them a YUUUUUGE tax cut so they would move their mfg HERE??? That was for the Ford Focus factory, Electric SUV factory was never discussed. He's talking about the tax bill that passed the Senate I assume.  Ford didn't get any special treatment. Uh what? Ford is intentionally taking jobs from Americans and giving them to foreign workers in order to save a few bucks. You would think Americans with a hard on for patriotism would raise more of a shitshow about these sorts of things. We shouldn’t be defending corporations that fuck over Americans just because corporations inherently strive to make more money at all costs and it isn’t explicitly illegal for them to do so in this way.  Since most people didn't bother to read the article:  &gt;Moving production of the as-yet-unnamed electric SUV to Mexico will allow the carmaker to boost planned output of self-driving vehicles at its factory in Flat Rock, Michigan. Ford is boosting its investment by $200 million and adding 150 more jobs to the Michigan plant as part of the shift Yeah, the self-driving investment is good news, but I'm wondering where does...   &gt; “Our growing ambitions in autonomous vehicles really means we don’t have room” for the electric vehicle at the Flat Rock factory, Farley said. “We had to come up with a different manufacturing strategy for our EV.”  preclude them from producing this "as-yet-unnamed electric SUV" elsewhere in Michigan?  Or somewhere else in the US?   Probably a lack of available production plants space. They have 2 other plants in Michigan. One of which builds the F150 so thats gotta be maxed out, and the other is going to switch from making Focuses (Foci?) to the Ranger and Bronco. Not sure about the rest of the US We could just not buy the vehicles.  You and what army?  The 501st imperial Dodge Durangos. The California Canyoneros Probably the ones with the Calvin Pissing On Car Logos stickers.  *Since you asked...*  - Elon Musk Call me when the regular joe can afford one, Elon. Patience. Everything's expensive at first. How long did it take for the regular joe to afford a car instead of another horse? You'll be able to afford oen just as soon as Tesla figures out how to weld steel chassis. everybody makes their own decisions, and I'm not sure I'll buy another Ford. I hear Nissan makes trucks in Mississippi, and they are pretty good. The full sized Nissans are a nope depends on what you need it for.  Toyota has a good reputation too. &gt; Twitter Silence &gt;  &gt; Trump did not tweet his displeasure this summer with Hackett’s plan to build small cars in China to be exported to the U.S., nor has he blasted the automaker after news broke Wednesday of the electric SUV’s shift to Mexico.  It's been said they took twitter away from him. He’s been tweeting this morning so might wanna check your source  Yeah, I should have known it was too good to be true.  His latest tweets have been coherent. I’m convinced someone other than him have been sending them. How do you know he made the tweets? Notice how they're coherent and inoffensive.  the china plant can be for china market but the mexico plant is for the US market so trump should react on the latter. His money laudering Lawyer now has it... No way, really? Make Mexico great again Trickle down economics.  It went and trickled all the way down to Mexico.  Success!   Lol. “They have to do what’s best financially and this electric vehicle is not going to be huge” Followed by... “We’re going for it. We think electrification is a significant shift in propulsion for our industry.” So the entire industry is heading that way, but it's not going to be "huge"? I hope they can driver over that wall. So Mexico can build them for less than we can, and we get to buy a cheaper product while pursuing higher-value activities. Where's the problem?  Edit: Thanks for the responses. I'm personally of the opinion that people cannot retrain quickly enough to find alternative employment in the modern age. This will definitely hurt the local economy in Michigan, although I don't know how to possibly rectify it. I never understood the dichotomy of "We're going to bring back jobs to the US!" while "We have to let the free market decide!"  It's like the expectation falls short on the global stage.  If you're a business, and a vendor says "I can produce 100 smartphones for $200" while another says "I'll do it for $100 and same quality" - you're not going to give a shit what country the vendor is in.  Chinese factories have suicide nets.   Americans wouldn't think twice to work in one that has one.  Which is also the reason the iPhone will never be made here.       I jump on Breitbart every now and then and it seems like this is a concept that everyone has an issue with.  On one hand they want no regulations to business, yet they want to limit the cheap labor pool (immigration) and where business can operate (sending work abroad). I don't understand how you can have both. It's like the imaginary mexican that's lazy but simultaneously stealing your job. It's just not possible.  It's the biggest sense of entitlement all Americans have.    We don't believe in sweat shop labor or slave labor.  Even where slave labor is used, i.e. prisons, that cheap labor is used for everything from tech support to fighting fires in California.  No surprise why we have the largest prison population.         It's called nationalism. &gt; Which is also the reason the iPhone will never be made here.   Actually, MIT did a calculation and showed that making one here would cost an additional.. $10 or so? https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601491/the-all-american-iphone/ So Apple must decide between paying $0 extra or $2.1 billion extra.    $10 x 211000000 (number of iPhones produced in 2016)  Pretty sure anyone in their right mind would go for the former.   It has a lot to do with comparative advantage. It's advantageous for Apple to do it this way, because it's allowed. If every company in a particular market, say the North American market, were required to source 80% of a product's parts from that same market, we could start to see some progress.  Remove the competitive pressure pushing companies towards bad practices and it will naturally resolve.  Edit: This is an idea that has been in place for decades in the firearm community. A certain # of parts MUST BE MADE IN AMERICA OR YOUR GUN IS A FELONY. (Not yelling, caps for emphasis on felony status. Please don't fuck around with stuff like this. I worked for one of the biggest firearms stores in the nation and it's really super important. ATF / BATFE don't play.) Not only that, it's also because the support structure (engineering / design / logistics / supply chain) is just not as convenient in the US than China. In China where the phones are being produced, the suppliers are right around the corner, and they can get a sample, or inspect the manufacturing line in matter of hours. In US, the turn around time is days. Not only that, since the engineers live on site of the factory, it's much easier and faster to do a redesign should a problem arise.  http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html  An excerpt:  &gt;One former executive described how the company relied upon a Chinese factory to revamp iPhone manufacturing just weeks before the device was due on shelves. Apple had redesigned the iPhone's screen at the last minute, forcing an assembly line overhaul. New screens begin arriving at the plant near midnight. A foreman immediately roused 8,000 workers inside the company's dormitories, according to the executive. Each employee was given a biscuit and a cup of tea, guided to a workstation and within half an hour started a 12-hour shift fitting glass screens into beveled frames. Within 96 hours, the plant was producing over 10,000 iPhones a day.  Manufacturing will never come back to the US unless Americans are willing to live like this. It's much better to focus on invention and innovation rather than pursuing these long work hours yet low pay jobs. Doesn't this eventually go out of the realm of business and into the quality of life in foreign governments?  If a ruthless dictator forced a third of their population into sweatshops, businesses would be chomping at the bit to get in on the cheap labor.  Businesses would turn a blind eye because it's not in their capacity, nor interest, to govern and stop it since they're just a customer of that country.    I think the only way to resolve this is for an a global work standard to be adopted and enforced.  If one set of employees expect good healthcare while another expect a simple food ration, I imagine the latter will always get hired simply because they expect less.  Seems almost pointless to try and fix this from within the borders of any one country.   &gt; were required to source 80% of a product's parts from that same market, we could start to see some progress.  Google 'Rules of Origin', you're not the first to come up with the idea.  Don't spin it that way. How much profit per phone? $400? (This is a real  number) So $390 isn't enough? Going by your figure. $82.3B isn't sufficient profit. That is your position. Tariffs are essentially just subsidies on US employment. The difference between us taxing imports from Mexico and us charging extra sales tax on the same products and spending it on make-work programs is that the former will cause a trade war. its because they dont care about any of that shit and just use the talking points to persuade voters  The dichotomy you're referencing here is in the details.  The correct way to bring back jobs in this context is not through some sort of subsidy or tariff (anti natural market forces) it through making it more competitive to do business in the united states (through tax cuts and regulation controls) which are consistent with free market. Unless you have to abolish the minimum wage and all the labor laws people have fought for over the last two centuries them manufacturing is just never going to be competitive in America.   Were competing with sweatshops.  This is where the government policy needs to be set. This is more important than mandating people buy health insurance. But the people who run the government listen to the people trying to make iphones and since they give more money to politicians than the guy in the factory, they screw thew guy in the factory. The GOP says the Free Market has to decide - the Libtards want to have some protection measures in place to keep jobs here. Trump being the thief that he is took the talking points away and yet, delivers the GOP style of Fuck You America. Where are all those "higher value" jobs that millions of Americans need and are looking for? They don't exist. This is the point. :D  The rate of re-education and re-training is fast outstripping people's ability to re-learn. So what do we do? If we install protectionist tariffs we get left behind in the global economy.  Rethink the notion that people HAVE to work full time in order to be allowed to survive independently? I understand the concept behind UBI, but the balance between first work and third world countries is not there yet. We cannot pull off UBI in our lifetimes. Also, I imagine everyone who has to live off of only UBI will end up living in giant apartment slums. I seriously doubt everyone will get a single family house.   I'm sorry but it's a pipe dream. I am for better labor laws, earned paid leave for all workers, and healthcare for all, but not UBI. It seems to end with everyone who does not own means of production living in squalor and competing for lowest bidder part time jobs.  The low skilled workers who used to build those cars now have no job.  It's easy to say do better, but then there is reality. I assume you have a masters degree, don't you? why not? &gt; The low skilled workers who used to build those cars now have no job.  ...who will then get further pissed off, decide to take the easy route and blame migrants, foreigners, and other scapegoats, and then vote for the next fascist into office who promises they'll fix everything by Putting America First.  And then the cycle will repeat again. We have a winner!  The rate of advancement and re-training is fast exceeding most people's ability to cope. I don't know what the solution is, but manipulating the market to try and stay the inevitable is only distorting things further, and really hurting a lot of people who don't know better.  This Director of IT's heart breaks for everyone who's unable to support themselves, or have access to proper healthcare, because of the system we are all subject to in this country. And this is only going to grow over the coming years as automation takes away more and more jobs.  Vehicle drivers and what few factory workers we have left are going to be gone in a relatively short time frame.  Couple that with the government ensuring that healthcare costs are going to continue to escalate out of reach and you're going to have some people ready to take up pitchforks.  And they will attack the easiest target they can find.  This country is in for a really difficult time over the next several decades, perhaps much longer. This problem is because we allowed factories to leave. The solution should have been better trade agreements. Even with automation, it's better to have those factories here. Agreed. Not retaining the means of production can be a Achilles tendon. One small cut and we're immobile. You are off a bit I think. From my own experience it is not the average poor slob (myself included) that says the foreigners, migrants blah blah blah are making life harder for them but other people usually people who are elitist snobs who put those words into the mouths of the lower classes. People they deem unworthy, uncouth or any other measure of human degradation.  Plenty of your people voted Trump.  Plenty of my people (libtard elites) wanted to fund better social programs, Single Payer health care and infrastructure upgrades that would have employed millions.    But no, the dumb effing white poors went for Trump.    Sorry assholes.  I still have my degree and high paying tech job on the West Coast.  I tried to vote for a better option than Trump, but too many easily conned "working people" fell for Trumps lies instead.   And you guys will suffer the worst because of it.   Wow, this guy really hates poor people. Do I? I thought I loved poor people, because they're often victims of a complex system they don't understand. Because masters degrees are useless for most people the point is how much is the poster willing to change their life?   We live in a society that has very ambitious people and some very lazy people, that is just how life works. To say those lazy people just need to step up is short sighted. if it was that easy, nobody would get a D in school, someone would tell the student to do better and it would just happen.  You make it sound like laziness is the only reason people don't do well in school. Some people just learn hands on and can't learn about things easily just by reading about them. They might be able to build/fix your car but can't understand the theory of evolution or  analyze literature or read good and stuff. That doesn't mean we should just throw them away, it wouldn't work anyways. They know how to fix things, have you ever seen Mad Max? You are making my point. Closing the place where they did physical labor, and telling them to get an education and a better job is ridiculous. But that's is what people say is the solution to outsourcing jobs. K well my point was that doesn’t make them lazy. They will find a way to survive and you might not like how they do it. Go visit Detroit sometime. Lazy is a bad term and I probably shouldn't have used it. But those people have different motivations. There is a segment of society that is willing to work, but not willing to sacrifice home life for it. That means no secondary formal education, but that doesn't mean that they aren't smart or can't work. but if you've been welding your whole life and you lose your job, you probably aren't real interested in programming.  &gt; telling them to get an education and a better job is ridiculous  the world isn't static, plan ahead and adapt. If it was that simple we wouldn't have poverty.  You cannot make people do shit, you can suggest, you can help, but in the end they make their choices.   I used to think like that, but with my 50 years of experience I know not all people will do that. I have family members that I have tried to help, but they do what they want to do.  We have immigrants that won't learn the local language, what do you do with them?   Society isn't set up to help the wealthy, but to help the poor. NAFTA does not help the poor, it helps the wealthy, and an attitude of "plan ahead and adapt" while instituting NAFTA, gets President Trump elected. What do these low-skilled workers do then? If exported manufacturing doesn't cost them their jobs then automation definitely will soon.  What we need to do is somehow get these low-skilled workers to vote for people who propose job retraining instead of government welfare for dying industries. I'm not sure how we do that since some number of them actively [reject](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-effect-coal-retraining-insight/awaiting-trumps-coal-comeback-miners-reject-retraining-idUSKBN1D14G0) the retraining that is available now.  We certainly can't coddle them forever with promises to "bring back jobs" because a large number of low-skilled jobs just aren't going to exist in the near future. These are people that will end up on welfare and, if we're really careless, contribute to the opioid epidemic when they turn to drugs out of desperation. &gt; What do these low-skilled workers do then? If exported manufacturing doesn't cost them their jobs then automation definitely will soon.  Not necessarily. Some can be re-trained, but others will acquire new skill sets.   Instead of shutting down a plant and moving to Mexico, They automate the plant in Michigan. Those don't run by themselves, they still need people. Yes fewer people, but they are needed. The machines to do automation? Can't we build them? - Jobs. Can't we maintain them? Jobs. Can't we re-program them when they need a different task? Jobs. All those jobs we sent away, of various skills.   Now that we have sent those jobs, if we bring them back, we have construction jobs.    But Mexico becomes more wealthy and will probably consume more goods imported from the US and spend tourism dollars here, creating jobs. Whether that trade off is worth it is up for debate but globalism isn't just about moving jobs to a cheaper place and everything else staying the same. That is the theory, but does it work in practice? The numbers say no. Look at exports via imports. This is good for Ford, and for those who buy Fords, nobody else. I'm going to call this "tour down economics". A ton of people depend on those jobs. Have you ever been to Detroit? Go to Detroit and ask around. If dealing drugs is a higher-value activity than your absolutely right. *(just humming the tune to I'm Proud To Be An American)*  *(while listening to a 4th Of July and President's Day Sale commercial)*  *(while reading a Be American Buy American bumper sticker)* Ford already builds their cars in other countries. Anyone who thinks Ford are “American Cars” anymore is out of touch. I’m surprised they were building them in Michigan to start with, to be honest. Ford is American in name only at this point.  Similar to Apple’s packaging: “Designed in California. Made in China.” Except at least that’s more honest.  while our roads and schools crumble, who will inherit this awful country? You, me, and dupree. 
 An eyewitness said the victim said to the paramedic "then why does it hurt?" after being accused of faking it. Can you imagine being SHOT with a gun and having a school yard debate with the only person who can save your life, trying to convince them you are injured? That is so sad. Can someone correct me if im wrong but, i dont think they are supposed to argue about it. They are just supposed to do their job. Have you talked to many EMS workers lately? I was recently talking to a suicidal EMS paramedic who was suicidal because he couldn't afford to rent a home for his family and was barely able to fix up a trailer for them to live in.   Corporations search for the absolute cheapest workers regardless of their qualifications.  20 years ago being EMS was a middle class job. Now it's been turned into the burger flipper of the medical world, and the older more qualified EMS workers are being forced out or into other jobs.   Some other stuff I found:  - Yosif was taking part in a religious ceremony at a Mosque in Hamilton. He stepped outside and noticed two men harassing an older man. Yosif verbally called them out, and he was in turn shot by one of the two other men.  - Dale Burningsky, 19, is the primary suspect as of now with a second degree murder charge. Two middle aged men harrassing an older man. Yosif called them out, one of the two middle aged men shoots Yosif, and now Dale Burningsky, a 19 year old is a suspect?  What? Oops, you’re right! One site said middle aged, and then then they released their first suspect. Didn’t edit after, thanks!  They also pretended he was white.  Don't expect facts from the CBC. Paramedics said on scene he was shot with a pellet gun, they arrested a suspect, no word in the article on whether or not it was a pellet gut.   Note also that pellet guns have about the power of a .22 LR caliber round which is still lethal. Less likely of course than something bigger but still lethal. A pellet gun is significantly more powerful than a BB gun which will penetrate skin and hurt like a SOB I have a .22 pellet rifle that shoots 1300 feet per second. It can shoot all the way through a metal street sign at around 50-60ft away (using a no lead, alloy pellet). I have a .30 air rifle too that only shoots about 550 feet per second but it will still go through a piece of ply wood at 50 yards.  Canada has a 500 FPS limit on most pellet/ BB guns, regardless of caliber. You’ll need a firearm permit to buy anything faster. I can’t remember the full name of the license.  In New Jersey if you have a plastic $10 spring-action airsoft gun you can technically be charged with possession of an unlicensed firearm if you don't register Possession and Acquisition License, or PAL for short. Most people will be fine just calling it a firearms license. There are companies that make .50 caliber airguns capable of taking game as large as a whitetail deer. People in my area by .177 airguns to take out rats or iguanas. These are serious weapons and not toys to fuck around with. Yep. The big bore PCP (Pre-Charged Pneumatic) air rifles/pistols are no joke. The .50 cal ones are nuts. Fully legal for anyone to own, felon or not. That is actually how I found out about them. I had a felony for marijuana cultivation, so I checked them out and got a PCP. Multiple shots, even semi auto ones now. There are even automatic .50 ones, made by Evanix, harder to find though and expensive.  [Pyramyd Air](https://www.pyramydair.com/search-results-ext?Ntt=Evanix&amp;sid=1375A617A415&amp;N=0&amp;Ntk=primary&amp;q=Evanix&amp;cx=002970863286801882398:jlcminxfwdw&amp;cof=FORID:11;NB:1&amp;saSearch) sells many of their models and dang are they pricey. You can own black powder guns too, right? No, at least not in California. Anything using gunpowder to shoot a projectile is considered a firearm in California and is illegal for felons to possess. Anyone saying different doesn't know the law in California.   For the down voters:   12021. (a)(1) Any person who has been convicted of a felony under the laws of the United States, of the State of California, or any other state, government, or country, or of an offense enumerated in subdivision (a), (b), or (d) of Section 12001.6, or who is addicted to the use of any narcotic drug, who owns, purchases, receives, or has in his or her possession or under his or her custody or control any firearm is guilty of a felony.    and the definition of a firearm is:  12001(b) As used in this title, "firearm" means any device, designed to be used as a weapon, from which is expelled through a barrel a projectile by the force of any explosion or other form of combustion.  (c) As used in Sections 12021, 12021.1, 12070, 12071, 12072, 12073, 12078, 12101, and 12801 of this code, and Sections 8100, 8101, and 8103 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, the term "firearm" includes the frame or receiver of the weapon.   (e) For purposes of Sections 12070, 12071, and paragraph (8) of subdivision (a), and subdivisions (b), (c), (d), and (f) of Section 12072, the term "firearm" does not include an unloaded firearm that is defined as an "antique firearm" in Section 921(a)(16) of Title 18 of the United States Code.  Muzzleloaders and black powder guns are considered firearms in CA. There is no exemption for "felon in possession of an antique firearm"  Anyone saying you can be a felon and own black powder or muzzleloading guns in CA has not researched the topic. I was a felon in CA until I got my record cleared by the state with Prop 64. Don't get yourself in trouble for lack of research.  Ah, I didn't realize what state you were in. Well, at least you have something (for now, I'm sure that "loophole" is gonna be closed soon). You are correct.This situation is specific to the handling of felons, and less of a firearms law. Legally, felons in CA aren't even supposed to possess replica firearms and airguns. Which are clearly not classified as a firearm, but specifically detailed in the stipulations of their release.     Holy shit, what brand is that? I just bought the gamo fusion mach 1 whisper.  Amazing how far technology has come, these things are definitely lethal.  Umarex Octane .22 gas piston. 1000fps with lead pellets. 1300fps with alloy. The .30 is Hatsan 135 QE Vortex gas piston.  I have an air rifle that literally takes the heads off of squirrels with hollow point pellets. They're definitely capable of lethality. Yep. I have a friend who blew his big toe off with one. That's funny, I blew off the top of my index finger with one.  I thought I was the only retard that had to explain that to an ER doctor. My grandfather did that too. He was trying to drunkenly prove to his friend that you could stop the pellet by plugging the barrel with your finger. Turns out he was wrong.  If only you could use an analog like a corndog or something.  Instructions unclear. Name checks out That's nice, but where do you find squirrels with hollow point pellets? They usually run around with nuts. Deez nuts.  Got em. Does any one know if paramedics could be charged for involuntary manslaughter on this? This is right they should have at least tired to treat him.  Have the power of a .22 LR? You have never shot a gun before have you? While this is true, many times .22 will also not even penetrate. It really is a case by case basis surprisingly  Did you seriously just say a .22 sometimes won't penetrate skin or am I misreading? Only if your sometimes consists of a 1 mile shot at somebody with some seriously armor-like clothes on or the .22 is firing blanks! I think it's always going to break the skin, but there have been one or two cases of people getting shot in the head with a .22 in just the right spot and the bullet bouncing off.  From what I had heard .22 penetration can be an issue, of course I may be wrong... these are just from friends who are hunters. A .22 has more than enough power to reliably penetrate skin and (not as reliably) kill. With that said, it is low enough power to do things like richochet off bones of large animals (like humans), so that is probably what your friends were referring to. Never going to not penetrate skin with a .22 under normal circumstances. Ah, TIL Are these men hunting Rhino? Because .22 has always been able to penetrate human skin. I guess it wouldn't penetrate Rhino skin very easily, though... .22 will not be a viable hunting caliber, unless its very small game like rat or squirel . that being said it can be lethal to humans at even 500ft.  Burningsky? Sounds First Nation. What a conundrum for Canada.  &gt;He estimates 20 minutes passed before they put him in the ambulance and took him to St. Joseph's Hospital, where he died around 10 p.m.   &gt;"He was promptly taken to the hospital, from what I understand," he said.  Hm 20 minutes doesn't seem too prompt to me, especially for a gunshot wound.  They also took him to the wrong fucking hospital.   They took him to a regular hospital when there was a trauma center even closer. Which would've been the right place to take someone with a gunshot wound. I guess pellet gun wounds don't get that kind of treatment. 20 minutes does seem long.  But if he was under the care of EMT or paramedic during that time it's not necessarily indicative of negligence.  They could have been working on him during that time.  However, telling someone that's shot is "acting" definitely is.  Any EMT or paramedic worth their salt knows their primary job is to get the patient to a doctor/ER unless they are already dead.  And even then they'll usually keep up resuscitation for the sake of being thorough and for  the family.  Source:  Volunteer firefighter who watches EMS work all the time. There are stories where the paramedics told him to stop acting, walk it off.  That was from the neighbors, who were doing interviews on TV.   Why don't you google the distance between his location and the hospital. Ambulances drive fast, but can't break physics/go through cars man. I think they were saying the paramedics were on the scene for 20 minutes before taking him away, not that it took 20 minutes between the time of the call and when they left with him. Yeah, it seems odd. It looks like he was mainly bleeding out internally causing the paramedics pause since the wound seemed too small for a bullet hole. Paramedics though are trained to assess, seems like they got it wrong and fucked up by trying to save the kid money because ambulance rides are expensive as fuck. They weren't trying to *save money* for anyone. Come on now.  An ambulance ride is $45 in Ontario. These paramedics just fucked up big time. This was in Canada, he wouldn't of had to pay for anything.  The paramedics didn't want to treat the brown guy with the name Al-Hasnawi Not true.  I know it varies by jurisdiction, and I don't live in Ontario, but I had an ambulance ride a few years back in Alberta.  Cost me $375 if I recall properly. First responders take patients to hospitals not by proximity but by specialization and the facility’s capacity.  Taking a patient who is emergent from a gsw to a hospital without a trauma center because it’s closer is a beginners mistake at best. The hospital was further away then the trauma center. So then taking a patient who is emergent from a gsw to a hospital without a trauma center when it's farther, like in this case, would be negligent at best. Yeup, depending on the country’s EMS protocols but I can’t imagine it would not be considered so.    I guess they could try and argue that the patient did not seem emergent, but that’s probably a stretch  It was 20 minutes BEFORE they put him in the ambulance, could you perhaps elucidate how the laws of physics preclude loading him in to the ambulance any faster than that? First responders sound criminally negligent. It's because the EMS companies are hiring the cheapest possible workers. You would be astonished at how many EMS workers are $10 an hour employees living in trailer parks, or even minimum wage volunteers who work part time at local grocery stores or other low paid jobs.  Corporations don't give a shit about anything but their bottom line. Paramedic wages in Canada range from $70-$100k/yr. Those medics should lose their job and license  Depends. If it was negligence, then yes. If it was criminal negligence, then they should be looking at jail time. If it was neither, then nothing.  The article is not completely clear on what seems to be the case yet. "Nothing" is correct only if you'd be happy to see this happen again. At the minimum they need some strong feedback on how to do better. so sad just put him in the vehicle and get him to the hospital and let the doctors figure it out. He probably could have lived too.  Were paramedics racist, or merely incompetent idiots? It's not clear. Likely classist. It's not the worst neighbourhood, but also not the best.  Probably idiots, if they thought he was just acting.  This may be hard to believe, but EMS workers are often so poorly paid that they often have to live in trailer parks or the projects. Many EMS workers only make $10 an hour.   Many EMS are volunteers only paid minimum wage for the time they are responding, and have to work second jobs. This is especially the case in rural areas.  Corporations have absolutely destroyed the EMS industry for their own profit. That might well be true in the US, but not in Canada, where this incident took place. Parmedic wages in Ontario start at $70k/yr. My bad.  Well, I was shocked to learn how low wages are in the states, so I appreciate the info.  &gt; His hair was long with a ponytail wrapped at the top of his head.  I believe that is called a bun. Utterly shameful form of conduct [deleted] First degree is when you have a deliberate plan that you execute, 2nd degree is an in the moment purposeful act of murder. Makes sense to me Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't everyone in Hamilton an actor? "Amin Al-Tahir, a director at the Al-Mostafa Islamic Centre, said he witnessed paramedics telling Al-Hasnawi he was fine, and that he was acting."  Someone says they said this. It could have happened exactly like he says, but there's so much room for error in this little game of telephone. A paramedic telling a distressed person "You're fine" to calm them down is quite reasonable. Unless "You're acting" is some Canadian idiom with which I am not familiar, I highly doubt those are the actual words used by the paramedic. Is this a joke? You can't possible believe a paramedic or public servant is negligent or racist that you suggest "you're acting" may be some Canadian colloquial saying you are unaware of? Do you think "Whites are the superior race" is a cute saying that some Klansman say and you are not quite sure what it means?  You should read the post you reply to instead of spazzing out over your lack of comprehension. Well I think that it ISN'T a saying I haven't heard of. I'm saying that I have never in my life heard another human being tell someone "You're acting" to mean "You're faking", "You're lying", "You're being dramatic". I work with a lot of people who have learned English as a second (or third) language, and what it sounds like to me is an ESL speaker paraphrasing something the paramedic said, so we have the media said that this guy said that another guy said.   Do I find it impossible that a Canadian paramedic is racist? (I believe this is what you're trying to get at). Not at all. I am merely playing Devil's advocate, because I am ALWAYS 100% suspicious of a news article. Wait until one is written about you, and you will see how inaccurate they are. Agree about the inaccuracies especially with the CBC Hamilton desk. They often misname the Mountain accesses.   "someone says they said this etc..."  So the witnesses are lying or mistaken? Just a silly question but are there security cameras? Yes but one was disabled by someone before the event and the other one only catches people running to the scene of the murder but not the murder itself.  Thank you for the answer. I hope they get charged with Criminally negligent manslaughter The musical? My first thought too, but no, the city is named Hamilton.  If he had had a gun himself he may have been able to protect himself. Criminals do bad things with weapons of all types. [removed] The people that do this aren't going to go away once the "muslims are gone".  They will turn their attention to the next group.  Gays, Jews, this, that. You should think about returning to your mothers' womb, you ignorant fuck. Stupid and ignorant people hate things they don't understand or things they are told to fear.  In Hamilton?  I hear he kept saying "I am not throwing away my shot!" Without reading the article, I'm going to guess he was Somali.    Nope. First Nations. Name is Dale Burningsky King.  Damn, ya win some you lose some.  RIP to dude, Ambulance services across the country are shit reliable.  Not blaming the actual drivers.
 Good riddance, the stuff this guy did children and teenagers who trusted him was horrifying. Good. I hope all the shitheads at USAG who covered it up and failed to report end up going down too. Steve Penny, the Karolyis... they knew. I hope so, the systematic enablement of this is as disgusting as the act itself.  It’s either that or gross negligence on oversight and both are unacceptable.  Good (accidental) job to the driver of the trash truck on that day.  They should get a vacation, who knows how many other cases will be made in their absence! Lucky him-- one of those gym dads would probably make him pay if he were on the outside  What a loser.  I hope this fuck running for office in AL gets a gavel to the taint before he can do damage to our republic. Something tells me it's going to get it hard in prison. He's small, and he touched a child. That's a lose/lose for him lol. He's either going to be in adseg/the hole/PC the rest of his life (which is 23hrs a day lockdown, 365) so no one kills or rapes him, Or he's going to get raped and beat to death in general population.   A well deserved sentence. 
 Puerto Ricans will now be able to purchase the "Restore Communications" package for $79.99/month. naw more like 99.99/month and shitty internet service  this ain't no chrsitmas, this is a dismas And unlock a sense of accomplishment.  Use the coupon code "BORICUA" for an extra 5% off your monthly package. My package already got 5% off right after I was born. Weird , my email had the Coupon “QueSeJodaBarcardi” for 15% off  Now to see how long it takes for that money to actually get there.   Approving the funds is great. Contracting the work out, keeping tabs on each of those projects, and auditing the use of the funds is where the hell of bureaucracy takes place.  Or who they get to restore the communications.  I am all for some Google Fiber. The cost of submarine cables to support such a rollout would exceed $77 million alone. Google Fiber is basically dead.  They continue in places where it already exists but there are no plans for extension of service and they've instituted layoffs.  Google has no plans to be an ISP.   Yea it was like, gasp, actually not profitable to install internet throughout the country.     That's why the satellite thing is gaining steam, because physical interstate infastructure simply doesn't work in this country.   I keep seeing this batted around, but they announced and started a rollout in Louisville, KY months AFTER those layoffs (unless there was a second round of them I didn't hear about). That's all new cable in that market.  Now, I'd grant that maybe they're slowing down, and/or some kind of major mismanagement happened internally. Or maybe Alphabet, Inc decided its other pet projects should get some wind in their sails for a bit. But I don't think Fiber is dead just yet. Yep. Look at our money that went to Haiti as an example.  Not to mention where a majority of the money is spent. Just a PR move to get people to stop bitching about NN Do you mean Puerto Relations, or Public Rico? It’s moving the focus to PR for good PR so PR can then spend money on NN which will be really bad PR and for PR.  Just enjoy a positive when it happens, good lord.  you mean 2 months ago? Yes, if everyone is somehow OK with people bitching here about something that happened two months ago, they seem to have no qualms about the time it happened.  i think most people don't pay close enough attention to even notice the date lol.  too excited to come and comment their opinion for those upvotes, they miss some important details It is a negative disguised as a positive, though.  How many folks in PR do you think will be able to even afford this if NN is killed off?  Not many.  It's a positive made to disguise a negative that will far outweigh it. Afford what?  This is the repair of communications infrastructure.  "Folks in PR" aren't paying for it.  You’re delusional.  This article is over 2 months old. www.status.pr says 77% of the cell sites are up and 85% of the island has cell coverage.  You can lay a lot of Fiber for $77m Its honestly the perfect time for an upgrade.

 Garbage pilling up in NYC? What's the news here exactly? So far as I can gather: "People Struggle to Learn How to Sort Recycling." That the garbage isn't the Giants.  New Yorker, here.   The city always does these types of projects in a really half-assed sort of way. The problem is they don't actually want to perfect the process because that would remove a huge swath of tickets that could be written up by Sanitation police.   The city thinks they're slick but they work along a process that's similar to planned obsolescence in electronics. They fully plan for people to fail at upholding the rules so they can add those ticket write-ups into the next budget. **They don't predict ticket numbers, they set them.**   What the city needs to do is establish a lock-bin system for the schools that works similar to the UK system. The UK has these bins for garbage pickup that are basically lock-boxes. You can't get into them and they can only be opened and emptied by sanitation workers.   You need dumpsters created with this same mindset and then you leave it to the city to take care of the rest. The city won't do it though. You'll have to drag them kicking and screaming all the way to the bank.  Would agree with this assessment, NYC does the same thing with traffic tickets. And restaurant health inspections haven't heard of that, don't you loose a grade if you fail A,B,C. This sounds like what they do with street cleaning at odd hours of the day in Daly City, CA. Yep.  And now they rolled out the brown-bin organics recycling program.  We started using it as soon as it came out and then saw that Sanitation was just emptying it with the regular black-bag trash.  Most people on my block have stopped using it because of this, but I insist to my wife that we do because one morning those Sanitation Priuses are going to go around to collect that sweet, sweet ticket money. Why is a school using bins and not a dumpster? It's NYC, basically all trash is curbside. Those bins are only for food/organic scraps. Everything else is divided into trash or recycling and goes in bags. You're trying to tell me NYC doesn't have dumpsters? Fewer than you would expect. That's crazy.  So what would make this school any different than any other business?  Nothing, far as I know every business does curbside trash as well. I believe the only dumpster pick up services are private. I've only seen dumpsters used for construction projects.  There's not much room for them in most places. Most New York streets and buildings (outside of larger, full/half-block new developments with loading docks) don't have complementary alleyways to place them. In a school you'd put it in the parking lot That's not even a lot of trash, by NYC standards. That's like 1/4 the amount of trash I regularly see at a grade 6-8 school.  How long until the city needs to use it's mob connection's to get a rocket? Good news everyone! Has this poor little baby they interviewed never seen any other school or business in the city? Hell, he's doing the interview right next to the new fancy food scrap bins and their goddamn RECYCLING. Iif he's trying to make the argument that the school's not being green he should try to take a picture when it's not recycling day.  This is a complete non story Huh? You didnt watch the entire video did you? You really should before commenting. There were multiple examples(with pictures) of 40-50 trash bags  on the curb. Furthermore, the community board(not just the 1 guy being interviewed) has filed a complaint as well. The mayor's office has already had to remind the school of it's obligation to maintain the same recycling standards as regular citizens. This implies the school was NOT doing so. Lastly, the residents are not permitted to leave garbage out on the curb on non-pickup days and the school is violating this policy as well.  They put garbage out daily, regardless of pickup schedules. It looked like 85% cardboard boxes in all of the photos.  The other identifiable things were food.  So I guess they need to forcefeed the children. Please go to the 0:21 mark of the video. Does that look like cardboard? The video that says the mayor's office has been contacted, not that they've reminded the school to do anything? The department of sanitation has said they'll be meeting with the school to ensure that recycling standards are being met, nothing that say the school isn't already doing that.  His pictures still look like recycling going by bag color, and recycling is picked up every day in the area &gt;His pictures still look like recycling going by bag color  All of those at the 0:21 mark are regular white trash bags. Please stop making excuses for the school not maintaining sanitation levels required of the community. Again, you attacked the guy being interviewed, but it is the entire community board taking the issue to council, not just him.    &gt;The video that says the mayor's office has been contacted, not that they've reminded the school to do anything  Apologies, It was the sanitation board that had to do so: &gt;Public schools have received extensive assistance and guidance from the Department of Sanitation on how to comply with the City's recycling law and the School organic program requirements, and it is incumbent upon schools to properly participate in the recycling programs. In this case, we will set up a meeting with the pertinent school staff to ensure they are properly managing their material.  A meeting would not be scheduled if they weren't violating standards.   Again, we are talking about a school of 3 grades. If they are in fact producing as much garbage as the residents are indicating, that is a problem.     So how is the amount of trash produced by the school related to the "green"?  Of course, it isn't.   But that's why this article was written and that's why it has these upvotes, so that ignorant people can say "see, I always knew that green stuff was just a bunch of bullshit." &gt; So how is the amount of trash produced by the school related to the "green"?  If you ask basically anyone who's not an armchair reddit pedant whether a "green school" should produce a lot of trash or not much trash, they'll say the latter.  Yes it is formally related to energy usage, however it's a bit silly that they focused on that instead of multifactorial waste reduction. I'm not saying there isn't a problem with the amount of trash this school is producing.  I have no idea.  And I sympathise with the residents that don't want big piles of garbage on their street.  But this publication turned a local story about a public building mishandling their trash disposal into an ideological attack on environmentalism at large. Yep, and the fact that the school is on Staten Island means it's surrounded by people who would go out of their way to spite anything seen as liberal - it's the only NYC borough that voted for Trump after all.   The video shows 2 bins and a few bags of garbage for an entire school while one of the guys complaining tries to say the school should be producing only a quarter of that - what is that based on? The smallest amount of critical thinking would require asking if the school produces more trash than the average NYC school of its size, or finding out if the green label has to do with the utilities used by the school, rather than how it treats its trash.   The school was opened 2 years ago and I'm sure there were plenty of NIMBYs complaining back then. The guys in the video are probably the only ones left keeping that fight alive, and the garbage is the only focus for them to complain about. Totally agree with this but why do they have bins and not dumpsters?  A dumpster would solve this problem immediately.  Totally agree too. My problem with this reporting is that they tried to create a nonsensical element of hypocrisy while exaggerating the amount of trash when the reality is there's a raccoon problem and the neighbors don't like looking at the garbage, so they want the school to put it in a dumpster and put the dumpster in a place that isn't visible. I dunno, the mayor's office already has had to remind the school that it is responsible to maintain the same recycling standards as residents. This implies they weren't. Furthermore, the complaints are that the trash piles up all week when the code specifically says it should only be put out on pickup days. That is a legit complaint as it does lead to sanitation problems.  No, stuff run by diblasio, and the NYC schools is a bunch of bullshit.  I don't even like De Blasio, but New York school performance has been shit for far longer than he's been around and is irrelevant to the conversation here. Reducing waste is a good goal; it lowers costs borne by the city related to energy, maintenance, sanitation and transportation. The article says that the school is designed to produce the energy that it needs, this has nothing to do with how much garbage it produces. Nuance is deader than disco in America, sadly.  If someone started a political party based solely on an appreciation of nuance, I'd be all in. I mean thats some trash, but is that really how bad it gets?  Because if so this may be overblown, that doesn't seem like an absurd amount of trash for a school.   Guess it's time for the trash barges In today's Gotcha Politics... Is anyone here surprised by this?   And the school doesn't have a designated dumpster area because.....?  I commute to NYC and I think I might move south soon.  You spend 2 hour's a day commuting, no employer ever cover's the cost, and metro north can never get you in on time.  I'v about had it with NYC. why dont they have a couple of dumpsters Par for the course.  So called "green" is often not Hey there Captain Platitude, how about you provide some concrete evidence or even meaningful arguments instead of just smearing shit and walking away? Smear shit and walk away... That's what my neighbors do. The school being "green" is not the reason the trash is piling up. Did you even read the article? Nowhere does it say that.   It says the school is "designed to be easy on the environment by producing the energy it uses." Wtf does that have to do with trash collection? You can't just see the words "green" and "trash" and shoehorn those ideas together without even thinking.  Who said it was garbage from being green?    You did. Although I would love to hear the mental gymnastics as to what you "really" meant.   No, I said that sometime so called "green" really isn't.    Not sure if English is your first language but most people understand the term really.    So you just felt everyone needed to hear that and it has nothing to do with the OP, got it.  Did you forget your meds or are you just a bit off all the time? Give the other members of the troll farm my regards. I've heard that line before, every time an idiot can't defend their points.   Like clockwork, really. I do not doubt for a second that you have heard that line before. You can try to pretend that's not what you were saying but it's pretty transparent. What did you mean if not that? Lol, you are thinking too much.     Could I possibly be saying that large quantities of  trash isn't that green?    There are so many ways to be "green" though. I don't see how producing trash makes them not green. They're green because, as the article said, the school is designed to be easy on the environment by producing the energy it uses.  Trash is unavoidable. Not everything can be recycled. This article could have just left out the word "green" because in this case it's totally irrelevant. Clearly there's a problem here. The trash isn't getting picked up. Is that the school's fault? Who knows. It doesn't even address that in the article. Doesn't mean the school isn't green.  Typically, green initiatives reduce the trash rather than create more quantity. most of the stuff in the clear bags is marked for recycling. Everything is wrapped in packaging. Food, janitorial supplies, school supplies. There is always going to be waste but NY is pretty good with recycling. Used to be you threw everything on one bag and it got shipped out to a landfill.  I totally agree, but those are not the schools touting they are totally green and they seem like they are much greener Nope. Thats not the typical meaning of green. Like I said, it could mean many things. In this case it means creating a smaller carbon footprint by self-producing the energy you consume. Electricity in the US is still produced by burning coal more than by any other method. Coal is harmful. Your original statement is just incorrect. That's ok. It happens. Yes, sometimes "green" is bullshit. Sometimes companies/organizations market a green image when they're actually not. It's called "green washing." It happens but it's certainly not "par for the course"  Yet, I'll maintain this "green school "  isn't being very green creating much trash.     How much trash is typical of a NY school? Does this one produce more trash? Less? An average amount? Do you actually know enough to be able to say?  I just don't see why you're pushing this so much. This article is a waste of space. I feel like you were pulled in by the clickbait title and fell for it.  [deleted] I think this article counts as a pretty good example... Did you read it? The trash problem has nothing to do with the fact that the school is "green." In fact, they don't even mention WHY the trash is piled up.  Ok.  The green school in the op apparently isnt all that green in creating  all that garbage. Should they produce zero waste? What is an acceptable level? That row of bags is about half of what my tiny school produced.  Green=/=zero waste Did I say zero waste somewhere? 
 I trade cryptocurrency and Bitcoin is going bonkers right now. It's only skyrocketing because CME futures are launching in 11 days and this created a short-squeeze where:  * people on the sidelines got major fear-of-missing-out disease (FOMO) * short-sellers got squeezed and then squeezed again when 12,500, 15,000, and 17,500 got broken through  This will fall back down to more reasonable levels soon enough and I'd say it will lose half its value in the next week or so but still close the year above $10k. &gt; This will fall back down to more reasonable levels soon enough  They said this at $500. Then they said it at $2500. But no keep saying it I'm sure it will be true eventually. &gt; They said this at $500  Note what I said and didn't say. I said it would fall back down to more reasonable levels. I didn't say it was going to collapse and stay there.  Bitcoin has had plenty of corrections, even this year with 40% corrections.  You can't go from $10k to $20k at multi-billion dollar levels - and stay there without ever correcting even if temporarily. Assets do not continue going hyperbolic without falling back prior to their next climb. Depends, actually. It's not the steepest climb we've seen without a correction, and with enormous new interest, it's not a big stretch to say it's just the expanding userbase. &gt; Assets do not continue going hyperbolic without falling back prior to their next climb.  There has never been an asset like bitcoin before though. Its unprecedented territory.  And they were right, it crashes and then months later recovers. Bitcoin has gone a very long time since it's last sustained crash... But if you follow past trends it's due for a correction. It will crash to 12K though  it could be as low as 9K. That being said, against following past trends, it will back back where it is now in 2-3 months.    Basically, bitcoin tends to crash where the bottom is around, or slightly bellow, the last peak.  And they were correct. Bitcoin has already gone through 2 crashes.   &gt; At this point, Bitcoin seems to be caught up in the self-perpetuating hype cycle of a bubble. This has happened to Bitcoin twice before. In mid-2011, Bitcoin's price rose from $1 to $30 in two months, before crashing back to $2 before the end of the year. Then in early 2013, Bitcoin's price rose from $13 to more than $250 in four months—before losing 80 percent of its value over the course of 48 hours.  https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/bitcoin-surges-to-15000-a-25-percent-rise-in-48-hours/ His prediction of when and at what price it will come back to earth is worth less than the ink it's printed with. However, it IS a bubble and it WILL crash at some point. A lot of people are going to lose a lot of money. Of course, a lot of other people will make a lot of money at the same time. It's a big ol' bubble. I don't understand how cryptocurrencies gain their value. Can someone post a brief explanation? People think they will be worth more tomorrow than today, and it becomes increasingly more difficult to make new ones, so there is a effectively a finite source. &gt;  it becomes increasingly more difficult to make new ones, so there is a effectively a finite source.  Like a gold standard or tulip bulbs, then? If there is a finite source, then doesn't that prevent an expanding economy? At some point, if day to day purchases were to become increasingly cumbersome, doesn't that ensure it's collapse? Yes, and eventually, I dont see a reason why Bitcoin cant be a stable currency/investment. However right now, no one (or not many) have an idea when it will get to the point where it costs much more to make a bitcoin than it is actually worth. Everyone is going crazy with a financial instrument they dont understand, and there is a lot of factors that may be artificially driving up the cost, and those factors are not accurately quantifiable. &gt; a reason why Bitcoin cant be a stable currency  It costs $4 for a transaction to go through reasonably fast. They can supposedly increase the number of transactions per block, but it'll require Bitcoin to split again, and who knows how that'll go. Even with that though, it's still not necessarily "cheap" for transactions in an overall sense. Compare to merchant fees for credit cards, which are in the 20-40 cent range, or cash which is essentially free unless someone pays in pennies.  Anyway, you don't want high fixed friction costs on everyday purchases when you're creating a currency, because who the heck wants to buy a $5 footlong for $9? (In b4 /r/hailcorporate) Don't credit cards also charge 1.5% of the transaction amount? 2.5% at minimum and some (Amex) are 4%+. Depends on your credit card processor. 1-1.5% is common for safe businesses (low chance of chargebacks, low risk)  Also fuck Amex. Well, it wont be used by ordinary people for day to day purchases, but $4 transaction is not a problem if you are dealing with international trade worth billions.  &gt;Well, it wont be used by ordinary people for day to day purchases  Then it's not a currency in any real sense.  &gt;but $4 transaction is not a problem if you are dealing with international trade worth billions.  No, but volatility (in any direction) *is* a major problem for that. Also international money laundering regulations are a thing, so it'd raise the question of why someone needs to use Bitcoin to transfer billions (or even millions) for legitimate business. Thats why I mostly refer to it as an investment, right now it is a terrible currency for several reasons. Im saying it could be viable if it stabilizes. Then it makes perfect sense for international trade because it cannot be manipulated by a government. Who the fuc are you or the government to tell me what to do with my money and how I should transfer it? Take your illegitimate bulshit and shove it. Or if you are doing something sketchy and want to hide the transaction.  Or are doing something non sketchy like buying a car. What is the advantage of using bitcoin to buy a car over regular money? &gt; Everyone is going crazy with a financial instrument they dont understand,  Smacks of 2008 this is why i'm selectively mining lesser known cryptos with stronger tech than Bitcoin - these will be the ones that emerge from the Tulipmania we're seeing. Not a bad idea but you'll need to be patient. Name some names.  Any recommendations? Which ones are you looking at?  I agree that Bitcoin might not be the dominant crypto in 2050. Most of business history supports that thought. Monroe is around 300, Monroe is gaining traction because it is a untraceable currency, unlike bitcoin. Darknetmarkets are slowly going to start using it more and more as the feds crack down on them.  &gt; Everyone is going crazy with a financial instrument they dont understand  This is an incorrect statement. *Some* are going crazy. *Some* don't understand.  Many are not crazy. Many understand completely. This is not a new thang. This crypto-craze is animal spirits personified. How are the costs of making bitcoin accrued? At some point people would have to abandon government issued currency, trading it for bitcoin with no plan to return. Isn't that a bit presumptuous? Or am I not understanding? Im saying eventually it will be a much more stable, and understood investment, and its value will be more accurate. It wont replace government currencies, but I would think it will fill a similar role as gold, or it could be used for international trading.  &gt; Like a gold standard or tulip bulbs, then?   You think tulip bulbs are a finite resource?  &gt; If there is a finite source, then doesn't that prevent an expanding economy? At some point, if day to day purchases were to become increasingly cumbersome, doesn't that ensure it's collapse?  Bitcoins are divisible by 8 decimal places.   It's almost like a gold standard, if someone threw the old gold bars into a black hole and everyone else traded a more microscopic amount everyday. Not like tulip bulbs. The Tulip Mania/Bubble is a poor analogy for cryptocurrency. How do I get a bitcoin? I've been told that I can get them for free with my top of the line GPU, but this makes no sense to me  Edit: Really? Who the fuck downvotes an honest question? Ignore the fools. You can profitably mine altcoins with a GPU.  Go to whattomine.com. figure out what's most profitable for your high end GPU. Figure out how to mine it. Sell it for bitcoin every week or two. You only have to pay for electricity. Enjoy. It costs a lot of money for the electricity to create one. I am more unsure on this part, but I think it is already getting close to be more expensive to mine a bitcoin than it is worth (perhaps its worth is directly tied to how much it costs to make), and that a lot of the bitcoin farms are essentially subsidized by the government in China with cheap electricity. What does it mean to 'mine' one? literally calculating out the block chain. The currency in itself is a math problem that keeps getting harder. This is a simplified take, and I dont know a ton about it. Hmm. Maybe they can just change the problem that has to be solved. they kindve do, I think it is artificially controlled how difficult it is to control inflation. Think of it as looking for a needle in a haystack. The more people looking, the bigger the stack and smaller the needle gets. If people stopped mining, the haystack would get smaller and the needle bigger.  It's meant to keep the flow of new bitcoins to ~6/hour. It was like that, but currently with a top of the line machine that goes for $1,500 list price you can make around $25 for every $5 you spend on electricity per day at normal US electricity rates.  However, it's difficult to get your hands on ASIC miners these days since the profits are so high.  They get harder to mine though as more people do it though, so it will likely not remain this profitable forever. Youtube "bitcoin under the hood" ... on phone rn and too lazy to link You can buy it from an exchange like coinbase by linking your checking account or using your debit card.  To mine them though, you need specialized mining equipment.  The current ASIC machines run at around 13 TH/s, which is far higher than any GPU has.  However, you can still mine other lesser known coins with GPUs. People invest in them because they can't be devalued when your government prints money and can't be seized whenever your bank feels like it. Isn't it infinitely divisible? Or not? Can someone also ELI5 on how you get cryptocurrency and how can you sell it. Think of like buying stocks. You need to create an account at an Exchange like www.coinbase.com, fund it, and then you can buy and sell it like stock.  I recommend using www.gdax.com - a Coinbase company - you can buy/sell w/o any fees for limit orders.  I trade crypto so let me know if you have any questions. Also, the last few posts I wrote might be helpful. Somebody told me I can use my top of the line GPU to essentially get bitcoins for free. Is this true? Ignore the other guy. In fact, ignore 95% of the people in this thread. They have no idea what they are talking about.  You can very profitably mine with a top end GPU by mining altcoins. Use whattomine.com for ideas on what is most profitable currently. Sell altcoins for bitcoin. Profit. Thanks for the info, I'll have to look into it. If I'm not mistaken, this seems like a pretty easy way to make free money You gotta pay for the electricity, but if you already own a nice GPU the returns are really nice... Do your research and make sure you're practicing good security, and enjoy the gains. Thanks. So I'm naturally limited by the Power supply unit in my system, so unless I need to hook my GPU up to an external setup, I don't really forsee power being that big of an issue (I live in a small apartment btw) This was true a few years ago now everyone is getting ASIC's now a days (i.e. specialized mining hardware).  It's not profitable anymore for a regular person unless you want to spend $50k+ on a small farm.  Think of it this way: if you could spend $2k on a set of high-end GPU's and mine one BTC per day that's worth $15k+ then why wouldn't everyone do it? How long has it been worth 15k? Wasn't it only worth 700K 11 months ago? Its at $17k right now.  It is not normal nor safe for something to increase in price so drastically over such a short period of time. Depending on how tolerant you are of risk you could try jumping in, but it could also collapse at any time. The peak could be next week, tomorrow, next month, or 5 minutes from now. &gt; then why wouldn't everyone do it  Because most people don't understand what the hell you just said.    It's essentially "if being a doctor pays so much, why isn't everyone a doctor?"  Because not all people are smart enough to figure things out.  [here is a short explanation](http://www.clickhole.com/video/dont-understand-bitcoin-man-will-mumble-explanatio-2537) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory It's a commodity just like pork bellies or wheat.  It goes up when people want it and down when they don't.  I am in crypto, some of it has a lot of interesting use cases such as full anonymous transaction (Monero, Nav etc.). Bitcoin is famous because it is the first and thus the biggest. It is a really big bubble right now and nobody in crypto really likes Bitcoin anyways. For me to send $100, it would cost me like $8.  They are a product that cannot be mass produced. Instead, they are slowly produced. Unlike fiat currency which countries like the US can print in any denomination and even just write down $800,000,000,000 in a ledger (no printing needed).  As such, they are seen as a viable alternative to fiat currency.  The market cap is seen by some as being equal to the global currency market. That's a lot. Literally all the money in the world. Only so many coins in the world. The more you have now, the more they’ll be worth in the future. Some are betting on crypto toppling FIAT, some are trying to ride a speculative bubble and get rich quick.  Supppy and demand. Same as every market Like any other pyramid scheme, hype and promises of making a fortune. Going to be fun when it pops. It's actually going to be terrible for a lot of people when it pops. "It" being the dollar. remindme! six months Bigger bubble is in bonds, stocks, and commercial real estate  Wait, bonds? How are bonds a bubble? This feels so incredibly bubbly.  I know a guy who claims he is a bitcoin millionaire though so part of me feels like I'm a damn fool for continuing to invest in traditional mutual funds.  You're only a damn fool if you think there's something wrong with what you're doing.  Mutual funds are safe bets with modest expected gains and that's not going to change.    Crytop is not.  Crypto will be big.  But picking who those winners and losers will be?  Good luck.  It's the .com bubble.  Big things will emerge out of it, but a lot of stuff is going to sink when it jumps into the waters and doesn't figure out how to remain afloat.  Bitcoin is positioned strongly, but it's not necessarily going to be the ultimate winner if it doesn't figure out it's scaling situation soon enough. The bitcoin millionaire friend of mine is fond of mocking me for my mutual funds.  He cashed all his retirement out of the stock market (paying penalties) in order to invest in bitcoin and other cryptos.  Runs a couple of mining rigs and the whole nine yards.  The salient point that I'd make to him is that until he actually cashes out, he has not realized any income.  If he wants to gamble, great. But not only has he not left the casino, his money is still on the table! remindme! six months meh. not as stable though. i mean, one of those had a hand in almost collapsing the entire economy; so there is that. sure, but anyone would bet on jpmorgan than bitcoin surviving. Yeah. Cause the taxpayers are required to bail those fuckers out.  not only that, but jpmorgan has many many many years of financial experience. They've survived a lot of global economic turmoil, unlike bitcoin.  Certainly investors trust jpmorgan more. Millenials may have other dreams though. lol "I trust an organization fined multiple times a year for financial fraud more than math" -investors, apparently. Right after Jamie called bitcoin a fraud, JP morgan got in trouble for fraud.... Are we on a first name basis with Jamie here? Does it matter? No, I just thought it was a bit funny math works for jpmorgan too, ya know? they've been dealing with math for many many many years. :P Yeah, but Bitcoin hasn't needed a government bailout for its predatory business practices backfiring :P right... and yet jpmorgan is a company investors will value well over bitcoin, seeing as how the former has many years of experience, surviving countless economic meltdowns, including global catastrophes.  But, hey, millenials like to dream of bitcoin, therefore bitcoin is better to invest in. lol &gt; But, hey, millenials like to dream of bitcoin  I mean, I personally know a bitcoin millionaire, so... not really a dream.  Not really. JPMorgan works on human behavior and greed. It's why it needed to get bailed out. Bitcoin is pure math, nothing more and nothing less. Speculation around bitcoin is another matter.  you realize you're comparing a company to a currency, in the context of which one has human behavior?   :P  but hey, any one who can be convinced by that sort of argument deserves to invest in bitcoin. I think we can both agree on that, right? Well you made that comparison first with your previous comment.  Yes, but their math is concerned with how to make themselves money, where as bitcoins math is focused on ensuring valid transactions.  and your point is? I honestly don't know since I didn't really get what you were implying with the JP Morgan using math thing, but I think my overall point is that Bitcoin is a system based on hard math with no self interest, where as JP Morgan has shown time and time again they will abuse their customers trust if it means they make more money  I don't think bitcoin is going anywhere. The stories of success have alot of people beleiving in it. They give it value because they want it to have value. As long a people beleive in it, it will work.   The only reason the money in your pocket has any value is because enough poeple beleive it does. Value is not inherent, but given.   which means that more people believe in investing in jpmorgan than bitcoin. Can you back that idea up?  Bitcoin is a bubble. Most of the investors are fools who don't have any clue what it really is. There are several other cryptocurrencies based on better technology. In a year or two bitcoin will be worth a few hundred at most.   Can't wait for all the morons who invested their life savings in it to lose everything.  Eh, it's a gamble. On some level, I guess all gamblers are morons.  But I made $80k in six months being a moron so what do I know.  RemindMe! Two years   &gt; Bitcoin is a bubble. Most of the investors are fools who don't have any clue what it really is. There are several other cryptocurrencies based on better technology. In a year or two bitcoin will be worth a few hundred at most. Can't wait for all the morons who invested their life savings in it to lose everything. RemindMe! Two years   Since I'm sure if it does crash you will just ignore yours.  remindme! six months  Because I'm not waiting two years, Jesus you guys are petty Damn you and your proactive ways! if you're so smart and confident then why don't you short it? "The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent." Not only that, you generally have to put up a margin to short. If the price goes too high, there's a margin call, and you lose your shirt.  BTC's price is going up exponentially. Even if you're 100% confident that BTC will be worth $0 in six months, there's nothing keeping it from hitting $80k before that, and you're completely fucked if that happens. Even if he's right it takes a few years for a bubble to collapse. Nobody will know until then.  Yes, that could change by the minute though.  ITT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5z2_fggZlI I'm just patiently waiting for when cryptocurrency tries to imitate EA's stock price. basically its the current fad for money laundering and undetectable transfers. Yes, the currency where every single transaction is broadcast to everyone in the world is used for undetectable transfers.
 Of course that number does not include assorted brands of US taxpayer-funded ~~sellswords~~ private security personnel. Taxpayer funded private security? That's interesting; hadn't heard of that. Got a source? Really? The DoD has long been hiring private security to guard base perimeters and entrances, etc overseas. This isn't remotely new. Google the company Blackwater or Xe. They're called Academi now. I'm aware of Blackwater but was hoping for a reputable source on their receiving taxpayer funds currently. Private companies that work for the government get paid by the government. That means taxes. Unless the government started having bake sales or selling pepperoni sticks door to door. 😂😂😂 "Hello, sir or madam, would you be interested in buying any baked goods to help the Good Ol' USofA in pushing back against the terror group that is ISIS? Buy now and lemon cookies are Buy 1 Get 1 Free! Just remember to mail in your Blackwater Bonus $2.00 refund!"    No shit i had a gas station attendant ask if i wanted to donate a dollar to the military... I declined. Then when i was driving off it hit me like, "the fuck did she just ask me?" i am military we dont take donations.  Lol...the F? I'm hoping that was for some kind of Veterans fund and she was just confused or something. Just phrased it weird? Lol...I hope... Yeah it was po dunk. Could have easily been a scam as it was her just being mistaken.  The libertarian method.  This would work well in some states.  Wasnt that the point of bonds and "government cheese"to pay for things while technically not using taxes.  Yeah, true..I think I'm probably just overthinking it. So where else would the money come from? https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/08/iraq-afghanistan-contractor-pentagon-obama/495731/ Really?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_defense_contractors  Look at number 1 under "A" Gotta pay the contractors somehow :p They've been in constant use since forever. You might remember how Fallujah was sparked because of Blackwater playing Rambo (always gotta love how the civilian side of things always ends up bloodthirstier than the military side).  In theory, and under various regulations, these organizations are only supposed to operate As security. We're not supposed to use them as a fighting force, but can hire armed companies to protect things.  And since they aren't paying themselves for the privilege, that means fat government contracts. It's really good money. You go to work and get paid every day.  Turns out, some people's personal skillsets are more exciting than yours.  Should they not be able to make money off them if there is demand in the market?   It's not like the US is using these contractors to overthrow African governments.  They're just bodyguards for diplomats and other State Department facilities.  Why is the government paying high dollar for ex-military private contractors for security when it get current military personnel for far less? Create a specialized detail in the Army, extent the purview of the Secret Secretive, or whatever needs to be done but handle it in house. Because the law limits the number of soldiers you are allowed to have. You can spend 1% of your budget and cover 5% of your low skill jobs, letting you use the real soldiers for jobs that actually matter. Because it is actually cheaper long term.   [deleted] Cost-efficient solutions for private parties, maybe.  There's a reason that the US maintains an army, which is an enormous sunk cost.  And let's not even get started on the moral issues surrounding the use of private mercenaries, who can never be held to the same standards as actual US military personnel. Yep, your last point is precisely why they have to be prohibited. They are going to be wielded to support US strategic interests when that involves illegal military operations the government can't be overtly associated with.   If we read in the financial press that Academi is buying a robotics company, I'm just going to save time and go ask Hideo Kojima what happens over the next 20 years. **“I will never send our finest into battle unless necessary, and I mean absolutely necessary, and will only do so if we have a plan for victory with a capital V,” he thundered. “The world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies.”**  --Donald Trump, April 27, 2016 "The numbers of American service members in Syria rose after a decision by President Trump in March to allow subordinate military commanders set the levels of troops they needed."  -from the actual article. The pentagon also claims the troop numbers are trending down, but the history of lying makes that hard to trust. Regardless, leaving the war to the people responsible for the actual fighting seems like a good step, not a bad one. Yup newsflash all presidents are non-interventionists as candidates and complete hawks when in office. See obama for the most egregious example.   Only true non-interventionist whose ran in the last 30 years was Ron Paul but America fucked that up hard  Yeah as much as i hate Trump, i also dislike that Obama gets whitewashed. Especially for his foreign interventions.   Obama deserves criticism for ramping the drone program up 1000% and associated missile strikes, but he never put US combat troops into a warzone like Syria, either. &gt; he never put US combat troops into a warzone like Syria, either.  That's not true. He increased troops in existing warzones and also put special forces into multiple new warzones (much like the current Syria situation). Have people already forgotten about the Libyan intervention? Special forces in advisory/teaching role aren't **combat** troops.  He moved troops from Iraq to Afghanistan, which he ran on in his campaign . They are still combat troops, they are there to provide combat assistance where needed, and undoubtedly engaged in combat operations. The same situation is true in Syria, the official line from the government is that they are there to support anti-ISIS groups.  Here's an article about the troops in Libya: https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2017/03/24/the-pentagon-wants-to-keep-ground-troops-in-libya-and-go-on-offense-in-somalia/ If you can't tell the difference between a dozen special forces troops and tens of thousands of troops, I don't know what else to say.  Are they literally boots on the ground?  Yes.  Are they sometimes forced to defend themselves in combat when going out with their students?  Yes.  Is it their primary order to seek out combat and capture territory?  No. Are they an occupying force?  No.  You're making a disingenuous false equivalency.   Oh sorry, I didn't realize combat troop classification was based on numbers. And "tens of thousands" of US soldiers in Syria? What world do you live in? Gotta give you some credit for using some bigger words there though! Congratulations on focusing on just the numbers, and completely ignoring all of the other pertinent categorizations.   Obama was the most egregious? Not the guy who started 2 wars with hundreds of thousands of troops but the guy who drew down and used mostly drones?  Well I guess I'm not surprised the Ron Paul fan is a little delusional. The guy who drew down, catapulting the region into another civil war.  So you're going to have to be consistent. Should we be interventionist or not. Geopolitics are a little bit more complicated than “interventionist or not” I AGREE!!!  But if you're going to claim Obama was egregious in his retreat from non-interventionism by intervening too much, then you're going to have to FUCKING DECIDE IF YOU WANT INTERVENTION OR NON-INTERVENTIONISM.   You can't criticize a president for going back on his word about being non-interventionism and also criticize him for not intervening enough.  Or you can be like me and understand that non-interventionism is a fucking myth and that as the only superpower on the planet the US must be involved and that we must do it intelligently.  But you haven't done that. You've gone the idiot route. The president can’t be a non interventionist because the country isn’t.  Even if  Paul had won, he’d be responsible for a whole bunch of interests that need intervention.  President Ron Paul would have been handed his first security briefing, and it would say Isis is a threat to the USA and our allies.  He would be forced to either keep going, or go against 200 years of policy, and all his advisers.  And if an attack happened on his watch (which it would) he’d be roasted. He also vowed to defeat Isis, which in my unprofessional opinion, probably requires some number of boots on the ground. Remind me again, who was it that sold TOW missles to these syrians and started this whole debacle? &gt; and started this whole debacle?  Bashar al-Assad.  Or you might pin it on the guy who set himself on fire in Tunisia. That's funny, I didn't realize Hughes was making BGM-71 TOWs in Syria. They must have opened a new factory. No, those came from the Saudis store that came from the US.  I know you're pushing this back to Obama.  That was absolutely a mistake on his and the Pentagon's behalf.  I'm not sure what you want me to do about it though.  He's not the president anymore.  Trump is and as they say in that biz "the buck stops here".  Do you want me to let Trump slide on these things because Obama did?  How do you feel about Trump's handling of the recent problems in AFRICOM concerning our SOF troops being ambushed, executed, and their bodies desecrated?  Or the SEALs killing a green beret?  Or the massacre of a Somali village?   &gt;How do you feel about Trump's handling of the recent problems in AFRICOM concerning our SOF troops being ambushed, executed, and their bodies desecrated? Or the SEALs killing a green beret? Or the massacre of a Somali village?    Obama, Obama, and Obama. Or Obama. Or Obama.  It's the universal answer to all things Trump. Trump vowed not to send troops anywhere it wasn't necessary. Unfortunately, because Obama pissed in the sandbox and didn't clean up after himself, it has become nessecary for the current administration to correct his mistakes, which is going to require more assets on the ground. This would have been the case regardless of who won the election.  As convenient as it would be to just pull the plug all at once we've already seen how effective that is. Obama got us involved, and now we are stuck there, and now more US boys are going to have to die because of that mistake.  I don't want to see a single drop of American blood spilled for Syria, Libya, any of these countries. As far as I'm concerned they could have asked their sacred Allah for help and seen how effective that would be. But now that we're involved, we've got no choice but to continue. How do you feel about George W. Bush and his Middle East actions? Just as bad if not quite a bit worse. Did you prevent you from voting Republican?  For me, the GOP will have Bush hanging around their necks for a very long time to come.  The Bush family to me is like the Clinton family to you. I was like 11 in 2004, so no, I didn't vote for GWB. And I'm no fan of the republican party either. Part of the reason I liked Trump during the campaign was it was obvious the GOP hated him, did everything they could to stop him and try to nominate that bumbling idiot Ted Cruz. But they miscalculated huge, and had to grit their teeth and endorse Trump. Trump was running on the Republican platform in name only, in reality the GOP establishment would have preferred to endorse anybody else. He said "our finest".  How many of our on-the-ground military personnel are wealthy elites? :p  He made his two oldest sons into their own division.  Donnie Jr is the Signal Corps battalion while Eric is the Military Intelligence unit.  Trump keeps them way, way, way back behind the lines.  Well if he sends the bottom of the barrel solders is that still our finest, or is that a valid technicality....obvious /s Seems we have been dominating ISIS since he became President. Then you didn't see the trend that was happening when Obama was still president. You sound like the morons who say Trump skyrocketed the stock market, as if it was 0 under Obama and not already growing. We were winning. Trumps policies rapidly accelerated such, saving countless lives.   &gt;Trumps policies rapidly accelerated such, saving countless lives.  Absolutely nothing points to that. All the signs pointed to ISIS on its deathbed long before Trump ever set foot in the Oval Office. Well the accelerated rate of coalition victories after policy changes does point to that.  At the very least, Trump's policies didn't allow a rapid ISIS expansion in the first place. Thanks Obama. I see you Trumpettes are still blaming Obama for all of Bush's failings. The economy tanked under Bush and Obama got blamed for that. The wars that led to ISIS were started under Bush and Obama gets blamed for that too!  You guys are hilarious in your stupidity. No wait, I mean frightening. It's frightening that I have to share a country with so many inbred redneck morons. I don't really understand evaluating a president by their campaign promises. It's like evaluating your life success by what your goals were when you were 10 years old. The world looks different from the desk in the oval office. We should judge a policy by whether it's good policy, not by whether it fulfills campaign promises. The fact is that the military's work in Syria has been great in 2017. ISIS is falling apart and we're gaining the sort of diplomatic leverage that could bring an ending to the Syrian civil war providing that we're willing to accept a less than ideal solution (no democracy). &gt; It's like evaluating your life success by what your goals were when you were 10 years old  While absolutely true the world looks different from the desk in the oval office, this is a false analogy.    "It's like evaluating your successes by what goals you set for yourself a year ago"   FTFY      to be fair gaining the office of the president you learn the real story about a LOT of things. There are things only select people in power know that has to change your perspective when you learn them. That is to say, I doubt we know the whole truth about anything going on anywhere in the world and I'm assuming people in the CIA, government and white house are more privy to information than we are.  Do you think candidate Donald Trump had spent serious time thinking about Syrian policy? Do you think he even had the right information to think about Syrian policy?  It would be stupid for Trump to hold himself to a promise he made when he was ignorant of the situation. I was talking about your false analogy, but I included this whole bit...  &gt;While absolutely true the world looks different from the desk in the oval office...  So I don't know why you are complaining.  But... Yes, while he wouldn't have all the information of a president, I would absolutely expect a candidate to think a lot on what was a huge topic, Syrian policy.   I wouldn't hold a normal candidate to their campaign promises if it seemed that their new policy worked. I especially would not hold Trump to it because you and I know Trump was not a typical candidate. We should just get out of there. No win in that place. Save our soldier's lives.  I look forward to the day when renewable energy takes over and the US and the world can just walk away from the whole middle-east region of everlasting sectarian violence. These aren't typical front line soldiers they are mostly special forces advising the locals in how to fight. We aren't actually doing the fighting. You know, just like Vietnam in '61. Lol. People actually believe this baloney? We're not doing it for oil anymore.  It's almost exclusively for global influence now.   It sounds like you’re saying the Syrian conflict is tailored specifically towards oil  If there wasn't any oil over there it would probably go back to the way it was before the industrial revolution. If Americans are in the Middle East for any reason, the only two thoughts in the public's head are: "Oh, they want oil" or "Lmao America loves killing brown people". ** Cough ** Military Industrial Complex ** Cough ** Which is a very real thing, but, there's a lot more to American military action than bathing in oil and brown blood.  Economic incentives for it, ofc, but reducto ad oleum is lazy and gives us an easy punchline that can obfuscate what is actually going on. are you being sarcastic?  this war is completely about an oil pipeline. No and that would be the stupidest way to get one built. Instead of bribing a dictator or just rerouting it to a place you can do so you're going to start a war, make it last for a decade, and then somehow end it in a way that ensures you'll have to pay billions to constantly secure it from attacks. Sorry in advance to the mentally handicapped but that would be retarded. You'd make more money just building one to the Red Sea and shipping through the Suez or through Jordan and Isreal or just doing nothing than any potential profit from a line through Syria. If you brought this up in an Illuminati meeting they would laugh you out of the big oak paneled board room. &gt; No and that would be the stupidest way to get one built. Instead of bribing a dictator or just rerouting it to a place you can do so you're going to start a war, make it last for a decade, and then somehow end it in a way that ensures you'll have to pay billions to constantly secure it from attacks.  Tell that to every empire and country in human history who went to war every single time.  &gt;You'd make more money just building one to the Red Sea and shipping through the Suez or through Jordan and Isreal or just doing nothing than any potential profit from a line through Syria.  ignoring your childish and petty insults, this is not true.  You'd have to pay Egypt and Jordan, and shipping is not as efficient for getting oil into landlocked regions, like central Europe, who's economy is exploding right now.    but please, insult me more instead of providing actual arguments that make sense.   Great post. It's sad that people have such a one-track mind when it comes to politics.  [deleted] ISIS was intentionally allowed to fester.  The iraqi army was ordered to retreat when ISIS marched on Mosul, even though they had every ability to shut them down. I personally believe this was an inside job.  ISIS was used to give the US an excuse to get involved in Syria.  The fact that ISIS invaded Syria from Turkey (A US ally), was armed and compsoed mostly of Saudis (another US ally), and that the US attempted to dull Assad's ability to fight ISIS, shows that this isn't just about ISIS.  It was about controlling oil, with a secondary purpose of agitating more conflict to sell more guns.    &gt;I understand oil has a major role in the US operations over there but this conflict in Syria does not revolve itself around oil.  Then why hasn't the US left Syria?  Why didn't the US aid Assad against ISIS, instead of imposing a no fly zone for Assad, the same way they did to Libya?  WHy didn't the US re-occupy Iraq and cut ISIS off along the border from within Iraq, and purge them in Iraq while Assad purged them from Syria?  Why did the US sell even more weapons to Saudi Arabia and Turkey, even though it's obvious to even the Layman that those states were supporting ISIS?  Then, look at US's history.  Why did the US stay in Afghanistan when Bin Laden was in Pakistan?  Why did the US lie about Saddam having WMDs?  Why is Iran still made out to be the big bad scary monster?  WHy was Egypt's military backed when it deleted the new Egyptian Democracy after the Arab Spring?  Why was Libya abandoned after Ghaddafi was killed?  Surely, if the US cared about terrorism, it wouldn't have done all these things. What about the million other things we use oil for? Good question.  We and the western world still have our own vast oil resources for those things.  If you’re asking, we (the US) don’t really use Middle East oil here , China is the big consumer of Middle East oil [link](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/07/dependence-on-middle-eastern-oil-now-its-chinas-problem-too/259947/)   thanks for this. Tired of people saying the middle east is all about oil. It's about things, politics, cross roads from east to west, terrorism, SA and Israeli relations, etc etc. Oil is so far down the list these days. By those standards the US would have invaded Venezuela or Canada a long time ago to secure oil rights (or mexico) and it would have been a lot easier to do so, hell same fucking time zones :)  Exactly . Have you heard of [Thomas Barnett](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_P._M._Barnett)? He has a really interesting ted talk from a while ago about the future of US grand strategy and he seems pretty good although a little old  I'll check it out. Thanks for the link.  Several years ago I was lucky enough to hear a former official speak. I wish I could remember his name. He was pretty high up and was giving lectures on US policy and things. It was an eye opening lecture if I've ever heard one. I know he worked for the state department, might have even been a cabinet member under clinton or bush. In any case I got tickets because I was in the military at the time. It really showed my how wrong my assumptions of the world were. The main objective is really Iran here, Syria is just a stepping stone. The US administration wants to annihilate Iran. they're trying to help the Saudis win.   I think its to establish military presence more than anything. Stir up chaos in a region, then deploy your troops and setup bases. Also gives them a chance to increase surveillance and setup missile defense systems in some locations. Russia uses the same strategy. So we can deal with terrorist attacks on our shipping aimce the region still is incredibly important to flobal trade? Yeah, you can't ignore the Middle East no matter how you try. haha totally not an invasion  I want everyone to realize something.  The Iranians, iraqs, and Syrians agreed to a deal to build an oil pipeline from Iran, through Iraq and Syria, into Europe.  They call it the Friendship pipeline.  Some in the West call it the Islamic (lol) pipeline.  Another proposed pipeline was from Saudi Arabia, through Syria, Turkey, and then into Europe.  Syria rejected this one.  This is why Syria is a target by the Saudi backed IS, and Saudi's allies.  It is why the US is pushing for a Kurdish state, made out of Syria, in between Iraq and Syria, so that it can be a puppet state to the Saudis (who will simply arm the most loyal faction of Kurds, most likely Islamic Nationalists), so they can circumvent Syria's rejection.  Remember that all the conflicts in Iraq and Syria have been because of this pipeline.  The Friendship pipeline would muscle Saudi Arabia out of European markets, making their shipped oil more expensive when compared to the pipeline fuels.    also remember that all Saudi oil equipment is brought, built, and managed by US companies (weapons too, but that's a different, but related story). Also include the US motivations for getting Europe from Russian oil to Saudis  Thank you for posting this. It's important that Americans understand we are once again entering another GOP resource war.   "War is a racket." --US Marine Corps General Smedley Butler Obama and the Democrats were just as much a part of it. So, which are the opposing forces in here? Iran, Iraq and Syria VS the US, Turkey and SA?   With which side France and Britain (or other EU countries) are? Shouldnt they be with Iranians and co. since they will get cheaper oil? The oil won't be cheaper necessarily.  Saudi oil will just get more expensive.  France is...I'm not to knowledgeable about.  But Britain tends to line up with American agendas. That's interesting. Can you provide some sources to read more on this? Thanks in advance. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Economic_Union  The EAEU eventually will include Iran, China, Russia and the rest of the current members and will stretch from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic via the Mediterranean and to the Arctic Circle to the Arabian Sea.  Between pipelines, roads, rail lines, energy and commerce in general is going to be one massive market.  Iran and China might not join but they'll make deals with the EAEU. Since 2003, I've always thought: 'we'll never get out of the Middle East'. Now I suspect that the U.S. government doesn't WANT to get out of the Middle East. Sure it costs a lot of money, but when you follow that money, you find the incentive to be perpetually at war. [I mean, they've declared as much](https://www.salon.com/2017/08/08/blackwater-founder-erik-prince-cites-east-india-company-as-a-model-to-privatize-afghanistan-war/). And the morons at TD thought that he would keep us out of Syria. The US has created the mess in the Middle East and Trump continues to make it worse. A good step would be cutting our ridicolously high military budget. Then maybe we could have a legitimate tax cut Tl;dr, it's a change in how they're publicly counted, number is trending down not up per Mattis, and they're fighting IS, not the Syrian regime.  Bit of a contra-diction you might say 2,000 troops that are rotated monthly.  So, you have many troops that are gaining experience in Syria.  It is not only wrong, but there are probably troops in Yemen.    At least, it looks like Russia and the US have a deal to not go against one another.   Ohhh how much xp are they getting? Where are they and can I go there and count them? Syria has no oil unlike Iraq so the reasons for the American gvt to have a military in the region no longer exist. Largely down to keeping Russia out of the Arab world that would only be really bad for Russia. An Islamist state in Syria like Afghanistan or a pro US Iraq. None of these options are good for Russia. Back to cold war with the Russians and we start with McCarthyism.   2000? is that missing a zero?
 &gt;Pai's proposed net neutrality repeal says those requirements and others adopted in 2015 are too onerous for ISPs.  Disclosing price, fees and data caps is too fucking onerous? If they can't handle that, they shouldn't be allowed to operate.  I've already lost all faith in the FCC and Ajit Pai. I did my part as did millions of others. How foolish of us to think we could outshout money. That is why money = freedom of speech. &gt; We find many of those additional reporting obligations significantly increased the burdens imposed on ISPs without providing countervailing benefits to consumers or the Commission.      No one can possibly beleive that telling a consumer what you are selling them and how much it will cost them is a burden on the proprietor without benefit to the consumer. He knows he's spewing bullshit Funny, I always found early termination fees burdensome and without benefit to consumers.  Why haven't those been outlawed? Because you agree to the fees knowingly. You don't knowingly agree to have someone lie to you about the product they sell you. In every other business it is illegal to lie about what your product does.  Fee = $xxxx.  SO BURDENSOME. OMIGOD! The craziest thing is how the conflict of interest of Ajit Pai has by having connections with the ISP’s that he is creating benefits for, is not as big of a deal as it should be. That should already disqualify any claims he makes. Should being the key word there.   People **should** have access to healthcare. People **should** have equal civil rights. People **should** decide for themselves on the abortion debate. People **should** have a direct line to those chosen to represent them.   Instead we have career politicians deciding law of public interest based on who pays them the most money.  &gt;Instead we have career politicians deciding law of public interest based on who pays them the most money.  The voice of the American people has spoken: *shut up, bitch.* His only connection was that he was a low level attorney at Verizon for 3 years more than 14 years ago. Otherwise almost all of the rest of his nearly 20 year long career has been in public services at regulatory agencies.   If that is all it takes to create a conflict of interest, then I don’t see many people ever being allowed into public service.  This will end up in court for years if the repeal actually goes through How can anyone see this as anything other than a corporate give-away?  Given the increasing frequency of mass shootings, I find it absolutely mind-boggling that nobody has thought to walk into the HQs of Comcast and Verizon and others of their ilk and just start shooting. You'd figure they'd be target numerous uno for angry people who've decided they have nothing left to lose given how widely reviled they are the country over and I can't think of a louder statement to make about corporate bullshit than a CEO being filled with enough lead to warrant a closed casket funeral. Expect a knock on your door. Pretty sure ur not even using a vpn. It is only internet regulations. Nobody is going to get shot over that and nobody should be shot over it. Calm down with the dramatics. I'd bet a lot of money that *someone* dies as a result of this. That would be the saddest thing ever. There is no reason for anyone to get hurt over this. That's true, but let's be real here. It's America. Someone is definitely gonna be shot over this. Its internet, not a pair of Jordan's. [removed] Should we be tolerating and donating money to pedophiles like the moral republicans or nah? No self respecting Republican would ever donate to the Podesta Group. Well the funny thing is they donate to the guy that actually has *admitted* to being a creep.  Good try though. Just joking, truly pathetic! Sad! I'd rather donate to a creep than advocate murder... You should aspire to be like me and do neither! Yes this yahoo speaks for the entire left side of the political spectrum...................... Yay for "job creators"! These guys just don't get enough recognition for the fine job they all do of lining their pockets collecting risk-free rents and building insurmountable barriers to competition to protect their monopolies at our expense. If we could all aspire to produce absolutely nothing but waste and redundancies, we too might be so virtuous.  Might I have another bowl of gruel, governor?   Only if you can spare it of course...
 It got reattached, they were both drunk, and on drugs. Not sure how you decipher the story on this one, I do not envy the officers.  Both where drinking but only the attacker admitted to drug use. She was just having a ball Thank you for this He claims he was trying to make her leave.   She claims he was trying to stop her from leaving.   I decipher it to mean "two fucked-up drunk poo-butts have a misunderstanding and get extremely hurty with each other"  I'm assuming the guilty party (the women in this case) is lying. I decipher "she claimed she had been acting in self defence, but was convicted of assault" to mean his claim was probably the accurate one.   Respect to them, but also mad props to the doctors. Regardless of whether she was under the influence i think its safe to say that every member of the male species will be sleeping easier once shes sentenced If a man used his teeth to rip apart female genitalia, he would be jailed for life.  This punishment is a disgrace. &gt;Del Viscio has been placed on a restriction of liberty order for six months, which means she must stay at home between 22:00 and 06:00. Appearing for sentence at Edinburgh Sheriff Court, she was also ordered to pay her victim £500 compensation.  That's a fucking disgrace. So basically she's grounded? I wouldn't even say that, it's more like a curfew. Aren’t people grounded with curfews? Yeah, basically. No she just has to be home by 10 pm and not go out before 6 am. How does a curfew stop you from buying booze or drugs? It doesn't'. when I was grounded I wasn't allowed to go out and play until 10PM... I wish my parents were this lenient when I was a kid lol And she’s giving up her allowance.   [deleted] She mutilated him. She should be in prison.  They should take one of her balls! Because girls have balls, right?  They have ovaries, which are developed from the same place. (just like the female clitoral hood is the male foreskin, skene's gland is the prostate, etc) Should be dead THEy were both fucked out of their heads.  Hard to parse mens rea when you’re out of your mind. Voluntary intoxication is usually not a defense for a crime.  The fact they were both off their heads and she had massive facial bruising and no previous record is mitigating, though. Illegal drug use is probably an aggravating factor if anything. The facial bruising could go either way depending on whose story is more credible as to whether him hitting her was self defense. I agree that having no prior record of violence is a significant mitigating factor though.  If someone was biting my nuts off I'd probably be repeatedly bashing them in the face to try to get them to let go... That’s one believable version of the story.  Counter offer- a man knocks you down and straddle should you and is beating your face in, what’re you going to bite? Where's the physical evidence she was knocked down and being straddled? Well she shouldnt have ripped that mens rea off with her teeth in the first place. SERIOUSLY. £500 isn't going to cover the drinking I would be doing to help console myself after a mess like this.  This is a huge double standard, if he doesn't appeal this I will be upset. Pretty sure this would require single malt administered via intravenous drip. Well, she was injured in the struggle, too, but the man faces no charges. He claims he was fighting her off. She claims she was fighting him off. They were both drunk and on drugs, so it's hard to say who to believe. The doctors were able to repair the damage, and thanks to NHS he won't have any medical bills to cover. So why does there need to be a huge penalty? If someone is punching you in the face is it a self-defense move to bite their testicles? No. If someone is biting your testicles is it a self-defense move to bash them in the face so they let go? Yes. Uh if someone is bashing my face in I'm going to do literally whatever I can to make them stop. That includes biting. If someone is beating me to a bloody pulp fairness sort of goes out the window.  Biting someones testicles is going to make them bash your face more not less that's why it's not a self-defense move because it doesn't defend yourself.  Could potentially make them stop long enough to regain your footing and extricate yourself from the situation though. I don't imagine he was particularly functional or cognizant after that.  If it's a bite release run maybe but based on the injuries that's clearly not what this was. Do you really think getting a couple bruises in your face while your biting someone's testicle and trying to tear it out is equal in terms of the trauma to the person? If this was the reverse and the punishment were the same I sincerely doubt this would be something that people would need to argue about.  Did I say it was equal? I don't think the severity of injuries is relevant in this situation. They both claim self defense, and neither of them is reliable. Feel free to speculate as much as you like what would be relevant or not in a completely different situation. Any investigator worth his salt wouldn't look at this as "he said she said, nothing we can do." This isn't speculation, and what you're describing is absolutely not how legality is analyzed and not how injuries and domestic incidents are analyzed. In order to be able to come to an opinion of "if their roles were reversed, this would not have been the solution," is by looking at historically similar cases and how they've been resolved. An investigator also wouldn't just go "well she's hit and so is he, so fair play," they would try to analyze where the injuries occurred, what instruments or body parts were used to apply those injuries and then try to dissect a time line of who initiated what, in what positions would their bodies have been in in order to make this injury possible, and then take in witness testimony (there were multiple friends in their flat during this altercation) to extrapolate the likeliness of the timeline hypothesized.   If 500 bucks is my reward for having to have surgery on my testicles after allowing someone to come into my apartment and hang out I would appeal that case and take her trial if the appeals process didn't provide a more suitable settlement. The male is missing time from work, likely could plead psychological damages, and was assaulted in their own home. &gt; They were both drunk and *she was* on drugs, so it's hard to say who to believe.  I'm going with the guy who was not convicted of assault, wasn't on drugs, and had the more believable story. It wouldn't even cover the plastic surgery &amp; fake testicle.  It's disgusting. &gt;He was taken to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, where his testicle was put back into the scrotum and he was given 15 stitches.  They managed to save it.  Scottish NHS. Goodguys. https://youtu.be/rksKvZoUCPQ  Bill Burr... Says it best... Judges in the U.K. have been ordered to show more leniency to women.    http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1311004/Judges-ordered-mercy-women-criminals-deciding-sentences.html I'd suggest linking something better than Daily Mail if you want to convince people. Government stats would be best. It's not an opinion piece.  It's reporting an actual edict from the Judicial Studies Board. One chesticle for one testicle- that sounds fair. Bro, men murder women and don't get a life sentence. Don't be delusional. Horse. Shit.  Men go to prison just for being emotionally close to women when they die all the time.  http://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/15/us/transgender-hate-crime-murder-sentence-mississippi/index.html  Well, looks like you're wrong. &gt;49 year sentence  You win on the technical "not a life sentence" side, but are you really going to argue that he got off lightly?  Using his stupid logic, we can't know if it was a life sentence until the 49 years are up.  If he dies, then my statement was true.  But thats just being stupid, like his pretending that a tiny fine and a 49 year jail sentence are equal in severity. I never said anything was equal. I said it wasn't life. What's your native language? I'd love for you to quote me saying "lightly". It's just retarded to say if the sexes in the OP were reversed that the man would get a life sentence. Am I wrong? [removed] Try to keep up with what exactly? That you're an aggressive, rude person who doesn't know what words mean? It means you are an idiot who shouldn't be let out in public unsupervised. You seem mighty triggered. I suggest you keep to your safe space. This is Reddit where we’re freaking out about male genocide. Just like when women got the privilege to vote, men will go extinct. &gt; If a man used his teeth to rip apart female genitalia, he would be jailed for life.   Any examples? There was this one recently - not a life sentence, but he was sentenced to 45 years at age 46. (technically he'll probably serve half of the 45 given that it's in state court).   https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/11/28/man-who-cut-off-ex-girlfriends-nipples-sentence-45-years-prison/903676001/ Your example is from the US, this thread is about smth happening in the UK. Also in your example much more happened. In the case here discussed the women "bit his left testicle". In your example, the guy choked her, strangled her, hit her so hard that she became unconscious and then cut her nipples off with a scissor. The women was also pregnant and with his violent behavior he not only endangered her life but also the baby's one. Additionally he has been arrested for other crimes before, this was more like a final straw. All of that is significantly more than what happened in the story above. Sure, so 45 years would be too long. The argument is that a £500 fine and a curfew is not a reasonable or sufficient punishment for mutilating the sexual organs of another person. Sure, those differences definitely account for some of the disparity in sentencing. But I don't think that those differences quite manage to bridge the gap between the two cases. It's been shown that women tend to receive less in the way of criminal punishment than men do for the same crimes, but who knows if that is what occurred here.  She was also pregnant and he beat her up couple of times... Right - he definitely deserved the sentence he received.  Video re-enactment of the attack.   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zhgTr6-E6xQ  Actual video of the attack: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fftnExG-WFg Sad part is, stuff like this never makes it to twox. Change the genders, and this would have been the top post this morning.    He says she was destroying a room and when asked to stop, they argued and she got his testicle close enough to bite it, he beat her trying to get her off of him.  She says that she tried to leave and he shoved her to the ground and began beating her, and she didn't even know what she had bitten was his testicle.   So he had no pants on and they were arguing while on drugs. I can only think of two reasons why his genitals would have been by her face in such a scenario. They were either wrestling during the altercation or he tried to put his genitals in her face during it. Who knows, maybe she was performing oral sex and suddenly went crazy and they are both lying for some reason. In any case, she was convicted of assault, has 6 months probation, and a fine. He has 15 stitches and a whole scrotum.  I can think of a third she put his testicles in her face to bite. Well yeah, but I'm still curious about what set of circumstances led to her being in an optimal position to chomp down on his nuts. She couldn't have just lunged at him, teeth gnashing. Were they so drugged out that he didn't notice her positioning herself between his legs? Were they grappling? I mean she could've just lunged at him I would've dodged a lunge but that doesn't mean he did she could've also just done the I'm not leaving leg grab thing and bite them from there or pretended to offer a blowjob. There's tons of ways to get there. Jesus, this headline is nuts. I want to downvote you for this *so badly* for this, but just can't  I went for the *low hanging fruit* and I'm sorry.  &gt;He was taken to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, where his testicle was put back into the scrotum and he was given 15 stitches.  I am amazed they can reattach it. Of course all she gets is a light slap on the wrist. if the roles were reversed, oh boy... Yeah, a woman with testicles would be a sensation ;-) There are plenty of women with testicles, it's not a big deal unless you're in a particularly conservative locale. Which women with testicles move out of ASAP. 90's flashback: [The Bobbit's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_and_Lorena_Bobbitt) Good to know where all the incels landed... Del Viscio said: "As he came to me I bit him. I just remember a noise and blood pouring into my mouth." She's talking bollocks. Well, how else did they get into her mouth? How does someone get close enough to your balls to bite them without some nookie being involved? Hey girls, don't bite off testicles. Hey guys don't hook up with testicle biter types. Now go have fun. She'll be co-hosting the next Golden Globes with Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. I like your style I'm sorry, but the UK is fucking insane. Rip a man's ball out, 500 quid and a curfew. Eat bacon in front of muslims, jail time. "I think I tore my sac" Only 500 is compensation lol.   Never stick your dick in crazy boyz &gt; Never stick your dick in crazy boyz  Yeah, because you might not get to pull it back out. It's like one of those Chinese finger traps, then suddenly a testicle gets in there and then she gives birth to triplets.   “What did I just say?” There's no indication in this story that she bit him through clothing he was wearing.  So why were his testicles exposed and out to where she could have bitten one off?  This sounds a lot like an attempted rape that was stopped. Holy fuck it hurts just reading the headline  I remember that episode of Supernatural. I dropped my phone and quickly grabbed my crotch with both hands after reading the headline.  They learned how to bang rocks together and make pointed rocks  *ouch*  and how to rip out testicles with their own teeth  *YEOUCH* If that happened to me...   -   ..Well..  At the very least..  -   -  --I'd be *a bit teste* I wouldn't normally advocate violence but I feel like once the pain subsided for a moment your only option would be to go full Sgt. Hartman on a motha fucka How the fuck is a company going to keep a  person on their staff after this? Must be fucking nice to have that kind of privilege.  Yeah I believe in equal treatment for all but I’d beat the hell out of her. Also when the media came around I’d be 110% unapologetic.   Sorry ladies I’m for the equal treatment of you all out there but that? Yeah I’d half a mind to kill you. Just cause I’m for you doesn’t mean I overlook the harming of another and especially a body part that is so dear to us men. I mean couldn’t you of bit a chunk out of his leg? His asscheek? Arm? No you had to go for the Crown Jewels.   EDIT: this comment was made in shock to the headline before reading the article, I have now read the article, and I think I still stand firm. Although fueled by drugs and alcohol, it was an argument that led to her attacking, him trying to beat her off of him (understandably I may add) and her being convicted of assault. So I stand firm. Downvotes? I’m guessing defending yourself isn’t a big thing for people. Look all I’m saying Is id be hitting her in the head with a lamp or anything really to get her off. I mean how is one supposed to act when you get your testies latched on to? Whatever emotion I was experiencing at the time would go straight to panic and terror which would ultimately fuel my attempts to escape, and in that panic is where I can’t guarantee what happens, all I would know is I want [insert whatever] off my testicles. If it’s a woman and she gets hurt in the process, well I’m sorry it had to be this way, but you’re latched on to my nuts, I want you off.  I shouldn’t have to defend this lol  You stand firm by his side of the story even though they were both inebriated? No, I stand firm by my comment that regardless of what it is attached to my testicles, even if it’s a women, I’m gonna do whatever I need to do to get it off if I don’t want it there.  I’m a pretty tolerant guy, and I’ll take a lot of shit, bite my nuts though and I’ll put that woman’s head up her own ass. I mean I got boundaries lol which I think is fair. /r/Feminism in a nutshell. Hmm. So beaten. Probably was an attempted rape, and she bit off his junk. How else would she be able to get to it otherwise? What do you think is the natural reaction to someone biting off your testicle? It's to bash them in the face as hard as possible repeatedly and if she opened with biting his testicle it would be easy to get at. How did the guy not go hulk on her and rip her apart for that? This bitch makes Lorena Bobbitt look like a princess.   And washes it down with a bottle of dasani water?  What's worse? Getting your balls bit off or only getting fucking $600 for it!  Let's look on the bright side. At least it was just one testicle. How can women like this exist in this world? and where can I meet them? You crazy bro. No, seriously, stay the fuck away from me.
 Clearly their firefighters are just more productive than the firefighters of poor people. &gt;More than 350 firefighters, 52 engines and six fixed-wing aircraft are working to contain Skirball, according to the Los Angeles Times. That’s around 20 percent of the total number of fire engines operated by the Los Angeles county and city fire departments, though it’s unclear what percentage it is of all resources being diverted to the fire, including from outside sources. Skirball currently stretches around 475 acres, less than one percent of the total area aflame.  Even the one percent's one percent portion of a wildfire gets special treatment. Well to be fair, piles of money would burn pretty quickly and spread the fire Do the insurance companies pay for this added protection? What you are seeing is what it looks like when someone actually gets something for their taxes.   I pay as much taxes as most average households, yet even I don't get anything from it. Truly Wealthy people get their asses wiped for them by the government using money from other people, even small business owners like myself.  It's BS. My employees and myself don't even get medical from that. We don't get proper police protection.  What the hell do we get? I pay a road tax and water bills, so not even that comes from the main taxes. WTF are we paying for???   You're paying for the welfare of your betters! By god, they're job creators! They need to be coddled and loved like enormous toddlers in their gilded cages, lest their homes burn down and they come to rip ours down and to build new ones. you're saying wealthy people don't pay more in taxes? These types of houses tend to be up in the hills, and that tends to be the first place the fires hit.   Furthermore, what's the average acreage of a residential/commercial lot in LA. Murdoch's place is 13 acres...so how does that compare on a firefighting level to a more common residential area? If you divide 475 acres (Skirball fire) by the number of homes in the area it does come out to about 36.5. So would that mean each home there is 13 acres also?   If so, thats 39 acres per firetruck.  Please don't take my math as perfect, was always my weakest subject. I'm still uncertain if this is just practical firefighting or favoritism.   They do not average anything close to 13 acres. I didn't think they did....i wanted to know what the average acreage was. I figured half to (maybe) 1 acre?  those homes are literally right there by the fires. 
 &gt; Toys “R” Us has won approval to pay $16 million in bonuses to 17 top executives if the company hits financial targets during the holiday shopping season.  At least read the article before complaining.  The key word is "IF" here.  If...if is good  I'm about to rearrange the cosmos and the one schlemiel who can louse it up is walking around IN THE WOODS?! One of my favorite Disney villains. I wish I could blow my hair up like that when I'm mad.  Villain?   Here are the facts..  1) Zeus unlawfully usurped the titan government  2) Zeus imprisoned the titans without trial or even evidence of wrong doing.  3) Zeus effectively exiled his own brother to the underworld.  But ya, Hades is the bad guy  Hades is so misrepresented in media. I can’t think of one thing bad that guy did,except the Persephone thing but she embraced that queen of the dead thing pretty quick. Zues screwed a lady as a swan and turned another into a cow. Fuck that guy. A lot of people did, and that's why we have all those heroes and demigods. That’s fair Athena was the goddess of wisdom, but turned a girl who weaved better than her into a spider.  The gods were as petty as we mortals, just more powerful. The modern perception of him is influenced by the Christian view of hell. [This is a good video on how the depiction of Hades have changed over time](https://youtu.be/kmcV90cya1Y) Zeus sprung free from his Titan masters and usurped their tyranical ways.  Also, way before modern concepts of justice were developed.  Also, the Titans were known to disdain future concepts of justice and would ignore justice in favor of enslavement again. What Zeus did was for the good of everyone. Not to mention cronus tried to fucking eat him.  He did swallow Zeus, but Zeus mama tricked Cronus and helped free Zeus. My point still remains valid. Anyone who overthrows a hierarchy that is OK with consumption of their own kin is a good guy in my book. Even if he has this weird thing for beastiality.  Hades wasn't exiled. The three brothers drew lots. Poseidon got the sea, Hades the underworld and Zeus the sky. So yeah, Zeus won the draw but there is not a single text I read about greek mythology where Hades is saw as an evil god or even mad. He's a necessary god, feared because you don't really want to meet him but still, not a villain indeed, on that I agree with you :) Hades also got all the wealth below ground as compensation for the shitty real estate situation. Shitty, shitty... We'll see about that in time but there's no way some accommodations haven't been made after all this time. I'm sure the dude is having a blast down there.     At least that's what she said "DISNEY" villain. You know, because in the movie he is a villain. The interpretation of Hades made by Disney turned him into a villain.  Edit: I'm not saying the Hades from mythology is a bad guy. He is as he is.  Sounds like my favorite author https://www.amazon.com/Reign-Hell-Novel-Steven-Brust/dp/0312870493 I want to do a lot of drugs with you. I don’t remember that line in Hercules Oh its a quote? Woops i do... but thats cause i was on drugs  schlemiel, I like the word schlemiel. [Schlemiel! Schlimazel! Hasenpfeffer Incorporated!](https://youtu.be/bJzF8_df1R8?t=12) In Yiddish a schlemiel is an inept person and a schlimazel is an unlucky one. A schlemiel is someone who’s always spilling their soup and a schlimazel is the person it lands on.  Jerry is both the schlemiel and the schlimazel of our office. We can still cut in on his waltzing! Somebody call IX I I! Holy shit I never understood that line until you wrote it out, thank you  Coming your most lugubriousness! Not really.. key word is what are the targets?  Its kinda easy to sound all nobel, if you set your goals so low that they are achievable by sitting in your underwear watching tv.  I notice that IF they do even better that number will go up to 32 million but they suspect that would be quite hard. Which makes me suspect, the 16 million is really a retention bonus to replace the retention bonuses they had to return and they sent the goal of sales targets, low enough to make sure the bonuses are definite.  Of course my theory on this, depends on actually seeing the numbers. Lets see what the sales goals are. Lets see last years figure. And then I wont complain. Because its so easy to make this look noble even if it isnt.  Hey maybe I am wrong and its just a coincidence that they got these bonuses after being ordered to return the illegal ones. and they really are serious sales targets.. at least matching last years. But we cant know based on article. so pitchfork still sharpened and ready.  One could reasonably assume that was the job of the court in this case - to make sure that the targets would bring in enough income to justify the bonuses. If they weren’t serious targets I don’t know why the court would have approved them.  I've also read in some other articles that part of the reason they give these large bonuses is to retain their Upper management when those executives know the company is going downhill and could move on to better opportunities.  They are paying them to sit to the bitter end, because they need skilled management to liquidate, trade, sell the remaining assets and fragments of the company. I know an attorney that worked for Enron from the day they imploded til the day they shut the doors for good (about 4 years in between) and she made DAMN good money to stay til the end. Wow, it really took 4 years to finish it off? I grew up in Houston and it seemed like an overnight downfall. I'm glad the Astros finally took home a World Series to Enron Field UHHH I mean Minute Maid Park, though! For a while at the very end it was just a skeleton crew administering the final business of ending things.  Funnily enough I was just reading about this yesterday. One of the ways Enron cooked the books was to enter into thousands of partnerships with other businesses, report all projected earnings up front to pad earnings and push the stock price up, and continue to report them even when the partnerships fell apart.  They also formed thousands of shell companies to hide their debt from investors.  In addition, they owned power plants and pipelines all over the country and eventually the world, many of which existed as wholly owned stand alone companies (likely to shield Enron if they (eg) exploded).  On top of that, to extend their profitability, they had various arms that did non-energy production/distribution related things - for example they had an arm that acted like an investment firm and sometimes a hedge fund (**Enron Finance Corp**) - they had a section that operated as a trader for natural gas (**Enron Capital &amp; Trade**) - they had a website, **EnronOnline**, which was a trading platform for over 500 products such as gas, electricity, bankruptcy swaps, pulp, gas, plastics, paper, steel and even TV commercial time - and in 1997, under the name **FTV Communications LLC**, they constructed a 1,380 mile fiber optic network between Portland and Las Vegas, and then under the name **Enron Broadband Services** tried to create a market for buying and selling bandwidth, eventually entering a 20 year deal with Blockbuster to stream movies - and many many more.  As a result, while they declared bankruptcy in December of 2001, they didn't sell their last business - Prisma Energy - until 2006, after which they changed their name to **Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation** and focused on trying to repay creditors, which it was still doing as late as 2009.  So yeah, even after they stopped doing business, there was at least a good eight years worth of work to be done. An interesting accounting point about Enron - they didn't just recognize projected earnings in the current period - they would package futures on projected energy revenues and sell them to people and then record that revenue in the current period.   Seems like a minor difference but people are still arguing about it today and it has a lot of relevance on the revenue accounting standards that we are nowadays  &gt; Wow, it really took 4 years to finish it off?  Would you believe that Arthur Andersen is still a company that exists? My friends father was a executive for Tyco International, not only did he not get any money, he was laid off and went through hours and hours of depositions even though he had nothing to do with it. TIL! I used to offer corporate IT support to Tyco in Australia around 2000.  Used to be great to work for.  We had an arrangement with their office boss for cream on the server orders (ie we assembled and deployed 20 remote servers for their offices and we would get one as a thank you (each order)  These were Athlon 1ghz with 2gb ram.  Definitely not cheap at the time. That sounds sorta ... illegal?  Not at all illegal.  It would be the same as giving someone a tip or commission for hard work, or a job well done.    Now, there may have been a crime committed depending on how that Tyco exec reported that gift/tip.  If s/he accurately reported where that money went by reporting it as a business gift, bonus, commission, tip, etc, then everything is ok.  If s/he lied about where the money went (e.g. reporting it as loss, theft, overhead, etc), then that may possibly constitute fraud, embezzlement, etc.  The act of giving that IT group a tip/gift is legal, but lying about it would be illegal. To be fair, if something gonna to make a hard landing, you need to spend extra on good hands to save the most anyways.   The guy actually made it start to fall usually long gone before anyone else noticed. While thousands of employees lose their source of income for the sake of profit.  All of this sounds reasonable until you realize how inherently fucked up the entire structure is.  Edit: maybe the company wouldn't be bankrupt if they didn't concentrate profit to the top and actually invested in improving their business?   It's apparent that certain companies refuse to adapt.  Cable companies, anyone? 🤔 Not to mention the current top guy was in AFTER it start to fall, if he can land it with more parts intact, why won't he deserve the reward? Correct, but a $1 million bonus for staying at your job is still quite repulsive. I can guarantee you they won't give bonuses to their employees, but simply expect their loyalty.  There is no shortage of desperate workers. They don't need to treat you well if they know there are 10 people behind you willing to do your job. Nah I understand the reasoning behind it, still think it's a shit system though. A $ 1 million bonus is ridiculous no matter how amazing your management skills are. Not really no, the skill might mean saving $15m Oh trust me, I know, but to them it's peanuts.   Their bonuses are generally based on a small percentage of net revenues.  My best friends wife's best friend is the daughter of a billionaire who owns one of the largest telecom companies in North America.  She has a billion dollar trust fund. Her brother is some made up executive position that does nothing but party and he gets massive bonus like this so long as net revenue is over a certain threshold.  To them a million dollars in laughable since they make more than that off their trusts alone.  Personally I think it should be mandated that bonus should be paid equally companywide. And maybe have some rules like management can get up to 5-10x more.  Salaries can stay however they want, but at least if they made that change when money is good and huge bonuses are rolling in everyone benefits. So being a ToysRUs employee will be an even greater nightmare than normal with that added pressure of "IF" on their heads. Gotta get our high level execs their bonuses, guys! Nah, you know your job's gone after the holidays anyways, and it's not like they'll hire new people. They'll try and push this but I don't think the employees have much reason to care. That's a huge fucking bonus for 17 people Less than a million each is not a huge for an executive bonus. For normal people it is, though.  So what's the going rate for executives who can get a company Toys R Us's size through a bankruptcy then? I honestly don't know but it sounds like you do. It really isn’t.. if that really pisses you off, then I would avoid looking into what executives really get paid in comparison to this. Reddit is the king of leaving out details in the title that drastically change the message.  OP posts for that Karma. A sensationalized Title cutting out the important part. At this point, what will these execs really have done to create these sales to reach these targets?  This is an absolute joke If Toys R Us just converted into a giant boardgame, miniature and pop culture collectable outlet I feel like they might be able to turn shit around. We have a store here called the "Discovery Hut" which is always packed with people. Half the store is board games, a quarter of it is educational toys and the rest is a mix of cool popular toys and collectables. It's a awesome store. When I go into Toys R Us I feel like I'm in a giant aisle of the Walmart toys section, except it's not as organized and a fair bit dirtier. Yea, what ever happened to the iconic Geoffrey the Giraffe character and the "I don't want to grow up, I'm a Toys R Us kid" jingle? Those were power houses in the 80s.         *Selfish Edit: Wouldn't it have been cool to see a collab between Toys R Us and Vans? Vans is doing a shit ton of retro collabs with Disney, Nintendo, Thrasher, etc.. Not saying it would have saved the company but 9yr old me wants a traditional Vans snapback with Geoffrey on it or "I don't want to grow up" Vans Tee. W/E - I just grew up with Toys R Us, hope it doesn't completely disappear.*  Shit tier marketing. Kids would rather  have an app than a toy I guess? Every toys r us is filthy anyways.  My 5 and 9 year olds list this year was paltry (3 and 2 two items respectively). I asked the 9 year old why she only listed a giftcard to justice and some craft thing to make bracelets and her answer was, apparently speaking for both of them, “We have ipads.”   I doubt im the only one with kids that have that same thought process.  My kids don't have iPads.  They love Toys R Us.  I loathe Toys R Us.  I should get my kids iPads. Don't get them iPads. Get'em a Zune Nah, an old casette Walkman.  Give them an imagination I stopped shopping there when they stopped letting me ride the children’s bicycles and electric cars around their store. I'm sure they have their reasons for stopping you riding the kid's bike. Use to work for TRU for two years, can confirm it's dirty, but I still appreciated Richard's hard work. I can't say for the American branches, but in Australia, Babies section slowly took over the whole damn store, and focus of the business.  Same here in TX. Toys R Us moved in with Babies R Us and were given half the store, usually less.  The internet killed them. This is the correct answer.  Toys are non-perishable and easier to buy online If Toys Rust had competitive pricing, they might have been fine.  Instead, everything there costs an arm and a leg Toys R Us price matches everyone.  The argument that price is an issue is not applicable here.  EDIT: Didn't think I'd get downvoted for telling people you can get things cheaper.  Did I mention that TRU donates $1 to Toys For Tots with every price match they do? For a consumer to know they're walking in to bloated prices that will only come down if they do research to find a better price that they then need to provide proof of to some unknown higher Rusty Power that is not the cashier.. thus pissing off every single stressed, overtired parent in line behind said price matching customer..  is enough to deter traffic.  It is definitely applicable. The problem is their floor space they have too much of it. Combine that with the amount of merchandise they probably already have a transition may be stupidly hard or impossible. Best bet would be combining with an online front to be able to unload their product. Amazon x Toys r Us.  And no one actually buys. Had 2 of those here in the last 10 years. Always packed but went out of business after a year I would love to see them carry more hobby shop type board games, seeing how I don't live anywhere near a FLGS.  What is their demographic?   Kids 0-5 They play with kinetic toys. This seems to be what is left of their core demographic.   6-12 They have lost these kids. Once kids move into online games they pretty much stop playing with toys. The app stores are huge but they get into Animal Jam, Minecraft, the 101 games and they all consume kids time.  Some merch spills over into the real world but it feeds back into the games.  13-15  School, homework, online life, maybe extracurricular activities, but toys? Nope. YouTube and streamers have become a pretty big occupier. If they aren’t playing games they are watching funny skits about those games, or watching streamers play other games.  16-18 Barely steps foot inside a Toys R Us.  Adults Childhood revival has been big for GenX and Millennials but they grew up mostly with Saturday morning cartoons and toys. Online mostly services the collectible crowd. But even the retail space is crowded by leaner stores like Box Lunch, Hot Topic and a few mom and pop stores like the “Discovery Hut”. We have “Wonder Toys”, but it sounds like the same thing. I don’t think Toy R Us could pick up the collectible crowd with their current theme and giant box store business model.   Target, Walmart and Fred Meyer carry almost as much stock but have a lot more to offer shoppers who are mostly going to brick and mortar for groceries. Casual shopping was a casualty of the internet boom and the Great Recession.   Millennials and beyond have big bills (college loans, skyrocketing rent, phone and internet) and tiny paychecks. They are scared of having kids for a bunch of reasons.  The present and future don’t look good for big box stores focused only on one or two things. They seem to be looking back where society was, instead of where they need to be.   I feel like they would still be beat by Amazon in that. Amazon is just too cheap and my wallet is just too empty. I buy collectibles and I always feel bad buying them on Amazon instead of the local stores. Why buy a $200 + taxes Harley Quinn DC Bombshells statue in my local comic book store if it's available on Amazon for $50 less. &gt;Why buy a $200 + taxes Harley Quinn DC Bombshells statue in my local comic book store if it's available on Amazon for $50 less.  .....  I think I found out why your wallet is too empty, bro... Lmao you think Walmart is more organized and cleaner then Toys R Us.  Idk where you live but that's way ass backwards from by me While changing their model might have helped, l think  Toys R Us was just another victim of brick-and-mortar vs. online retailers. Why fight crowds and deal with wrangling kids who might latch onto something not planned? FAO Schwartz had a closer model to what you described, and they still buckled. This again? From the last time this was posted, and the time before that. Thanks to /u/Laminar_flo  &gt;This is always a hugely controversial area, but its worth understanding the other side of this issue. 'Retention bonuses' are extremely common in bankruptcies, and not paying them could make the situation worse and result in a bigger loss for bondholders. First and most important thing is that Toys R Us filed Ch11/Reorganization, not Ch7/Liquidation. Toys R Us will continue to exist.  &gt;When a company declares BK, the first thing that happens is that everybody starts looking for a new job. Secondly, BKs are extremely complicated and delicate. If this goes wrong, then the Ch11 could convert to Ch7 and then Toys R Us goes away and everybody loses their jobs including store level employees. These retention bonuses exist to reward the turnaround team for 1) succeeding in the restructuring, and 2) staying at the company. Again, if your whole management team leaves the company in the middle of a BK, there's nobody to drive the car, and you end up going off the cliff.  &gt;Lastly, and very importantly, this money is paid out of the bondholders recovery pool. In plain english, this money isn't coming from Mom &amp; Pop investors, and it was never going to the store level associates - the money is coming from hedge funds/banks/PE firms/vulture funds. They are very sophisticated investors who know what they are getting into and they are also the people that Reddit loves to hate  EDIT: Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7dea8y/bankrupt_toys_r_us_wants_to_pay_16_million_in/dpx4g69/?st=javl2c2d&amp;sh=51531f0a Yeah but still, fuck this. Having been a vendor on the other end of a bankruptcy where a giant hotel chain worth billions (I'm assuming since the founder himself is worth $1 billion) owed me thousands in overdue invoices, this is hard to swallow. They  fucked over every company who provided services to them in the previous 30-90 days, which the hotels had already made their profits on (food and beverage vendors, audio visual/production companies, etc.). I don't think it's ok for them to decide not to pay the companies they owe money to, but the executives still line their pockets with bonuses and investors improve their share values. If you can't afford to keep the doors open, you should close. Nobody deserves to be rewarded for being a part of a failing company when everyone else has to suffer to keep it alive. In this world, the bondholders and the executives are more important than the grease that keeps the wheels spinning. I'd like to see the company run with these people stocking the shelves and running the registers.  Companies often file for bankruptcy to avoid paying back money they owed. See: Donald Trump No thanks. Yeah I’d rather not  Congratulations! You just discovered the definition of Bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is a necessary and useful tool that capitalism cannot function without lest it risk even greater periodic collapse than we already see. However, like everything else, it is a completely different type of tool for moneyed interests; for the poor it's a "way out" from unsustainable debts, for the rich its another tool to get more while fucking everyone else over. Can I call bankruptcy and not pay my credit card bills? And continue on with my life? Maybe get a raise too? The first two, literally yes.  You'll have bad credit for seven years though, and may be required to sell a bunch of luxuries. I wonder if this guy actually knows individual bankruptcy exists... Um, no.  You have to go to court and prove you can't pay.  Also, a chapter 7 stays on for 10 years, and it's what most regular people have to do.  i mean what he said wasn't untrue, just failed to mention the fact that you need to prove you can't pay. If you can pay, you just have to run them up more on non-tangible items like holidays.   Or you can buy lots of small stuff, they only really care about houses and cars.   So if you're a renter, run them up buying toysrus stock on black friday, declare bankruptcy and then sell it all on ebay at full price.  What?!? The government should be giving me money after removing my debt! Who do you think you are?  A bank or something? You can (declare bankruptcy), and it will go to a bankruptcy judge who will decide if your bills and debts vs income are sufficient to grant relief under Chapter 7 (Discharge all or Part of debt) or 13 (Negotiate/Renegotiate a plan with Bankruptcy Court Protections to repay your debt under more favorable terms) From my understanding, perhaps it's a state thing, individuals cannot file Chapter 7 anymore. Businesses are allowed to but individuals are required to file Chapter 13 where they will have to repay an agreed amount. Its harder to declare chapter 7 now. But not impossible. I had to do it after my divorce. Ive purchased a house since, but i still cannot get a credit card or store credit anywhere. The only card i could get is secured.  Generally follows the Uniform Commercial Code which I do recall being amended only a few years back to make chapter 7 harder to meet, [but based on this site it appears to be still available.]( http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-7-bankruptcy-basics). I don't think based on reading some news sources it's used as widespread as it once was. I hate to break it to you but no executive , employee, manager or shareholder wants to go into bk.   They would line their pockets much more if the usiness was succeeding.  We landed on the moon! As noted above, they filed [Chapter 11 bankruptcy](http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-11-bankruptcy-basics), meaning they still have to pay back their debts. Companies don’t “often” do that. You may be able to find a few examples (Trump), but if youre actually trying to continue the business, filing bankruptcy is the last thing you want. Good luck getting any decent lines of credit for the next few years while having to pay for bankruptcy lawyers.   Plus, companies just can’t elect to “not pay” and file bankruptcy. Once you file bankruptcy, the process is handled in court, where creditors have the first rights to recoup the money their owed.  No shit dude. That's exactly what bankruptcy is. And don't think it's all rainbows and sunflowers, going through bankruptcy as either an individual or a company is not a pretty thing, and it is not just filled willy-nilly. Companies who file chapter 7 or 11 must follow very specific rules.  Bingo, which is why this feels so bad. I get that the money paid here is not from the company but investors for this particular intent, but it's still madness. Sorry that happened to you. Well no money is being paid here yet. A key part the title left out is these are conditional bonuses that will be paid if the company meets certain financial targets.   They’re basically trying to incentivize the new management to turn the company around.  Retention bonuses were already agreed to prior to these new payments. This is Reddit astro-turfing to deflect anger online. These are holiday incentive bonuses, NOT the $ millions already agreed to in retention bonuses during initial bankruptcy proceedings. &gt; If you can't afford to keep the doors open, you should close.  Yes, let's kick 65 *thousand* employees to the curb during the holidays because of your feelings on incentive bonuses used to turn companies around, money that doesn't come from the company nor was pay that could go to said employees. You do understand that Toys Backwards R Us is not 17 highly paid execs and 64,983 people at cash registers, right? We're talking about a very large company.  If you want to argue that these bonuses are just too high, guess what! We actually agree. But to suggest they should not exist, and to then suggest that Chapter 11 bankruptcy should not exist, is simply false. It would make situations much worse, and cost people more money, and cause more unemployment. This guy economies  Scenario One: No one qualified to take over is willing to take control. Chapter 11 becomes chapter 7. You get pennies on the dollar if you are lucky. All stake holders (bondholders, stockholders) also get pennies on the dollar  Scenario Two: You get someone remotely qualified to take over and/or stay on, pay them a bonus to do so. This company gets a second chance. You get pennies on the dollar if you are lucky, stakeholders have a shot at getting more, not guaranteed  Either way you get pennies on the dollar. Yes, it sucks, but unfortunately its the risk of doing business with anyone be it will a billion dollar company or your neighbor.  I'm a bankruptcy lawyer and your comment is actually hinting at a good concept actually in the Bankruptcy Code -- under the Bankruptcy Code, you have to prove that stakeholders (creditors and equity) will both receive more under a chapter 11 plan than a chapter 7 liquidation (called the best interests test).   Stockholders actually don’t have a right to any money in bankruptcy proceeding.  They do have a right, they are just absolutely last in line, so rarely ever wind up with anything I don’t think you understand that not compensating the people who weather the storm just makes the situation you describe *worse*.   You’re not arguing against bonuses and salary. Not being able to repay debt and filing for protection is exactly what bankruptcy is. You’re saying no one should be able to file unless they have $0 - that’s not how bankruptcy works in *any* case. The point of ch 11 is precisely so that the business can reorganize so that in the future, it *can* pay for shit.   If you had your druthers, not only would business be more merciless and unforgiving, but no one would ever have an incentive to actually try to fix a problem. Your solution leads to more unemployment and flies in the face of bankruptcy itself.  With all due respect, this is the risk of business. I run a business and am always mindful of my clients financial situations and ability to pay invoices.  If my clients can't pay, I can be upset at them, but ultimately it comes down to me to identify and work with reliable, paying partners and clients. I completely agree with you. However, you cannot predict that a very large company you have done business with on a daily basis for 8+ years, which has paid every invoice on time, will suddenly stop paying.  Being complacent isn't a good defense for not doing continuous due diligence.  Just because a company has paid every invoice on time doesn't indicate that they will for eternity.  A good small business owner should be constantly assessing clients. They say it's to keep talent around for what's to come, but if they messed this up, I don't see their value or need for a bonus. Their probably in this predicament because of poor management, yet we reward it? I don't know much about the Toys R Us situation, but I do know they're a retail store chain.  The entire retail industry is getting crushed by Amazon.  It's likely that their problems are not entirely self-imposed. I think that's my biggest problem with it too. I worked for toys R us years ago. my managers fucking sucked. Even at the lowest levels it was shit. Then when the corporate guys would come in, everyone went into crisis mode. Did we sell enough "BPP's (Buyer Protection Plans)?"  Fuck that. this business went down for a reason. its extremely mismanaged. They sell fucking toys for christ sake. And while they might not get to pick what they stock on their shelves, you're going to have a hard time convincing me that the demand isn't there. Kids want toys. that isn't ever going to change. There isn't a kid alive that doesn't love going to the toy store and seeing all that stuff in person.   I miss the shit out of KB toys, and I'll miss Toy's R Us too. But honestly, working at a toy store should be a blast. Instead, it was a total misery. Something is fundamentally wrong with your business model if you can make that work environment suck.  I worked for Toy Liquidators, KB Toys' clearance outlet store, in high school.  It was a fun job while we had a good manager.  We played around and kept the store as neat as you could with little hellions tearing it apart every day.  Then a new bitch came in and within about 2 months, everybody had been driven away and it just sucked to work there. I heard once that “You leave your manager, not your job,” and it definitely resonated for a couple of the jobs I’ve left.  It’s amazing what a change one manager can bring to a workplace.  I know that story. I've had a few bad managers at Wal-Mart. It's surprising how everything is somehow magically better when they disappear even if you couldn't put your finger on exactly what it is that changed. Am in Talent Development.. This and "its easier to change people than it is to *change* people"  are common sayings.. It's always someone else's fault.  It's true to some degree. Loved my last manager but was getting bored/concerned that I would continue doing the same work regardless of how senior or principle my title became. Changed jobs, new manager was a shit show and within 6 months I started putting out feelers to get my old job back (which paid around 12% less I might add), but no luck there. I left when they had a hiring freeze.  Luckily my new company sacked a ton of people including my supervisor.  Now my newest supervisor seems like the right kind of person again (still feeling it out until more time has passed).  Anyway point is I agree. I regret leaving a job with a manager that I liked and considered a mentor. Manager at new job had me ready to leave almost immediately.  They were fired and replaced; seems like I might be willing to stick around now. I miss KB too.  After they folded there was no legit toy store that you could find in shopping malls. FAO Shwartz They still exist? This CEO wasn't there years ago. He was hired in 2015 to minimize the crash after they fucked up all the things you mentioned.  Disagree the demand is still what it used to be. With the introduction of high end video games, demand for physical toys is nowhere near what it used to be. I think the biggest problem for brick and mortar stores is online buying. We all know the advantage of online buying. And there is a huge financial benefit to online selling. So the brick store compete heavily with the easy option. But the company doesn’t want to give up and close all stores. So they resort to selling credit cards. Brick stores make more money selling their credit cards than their products. Their products are likely priced close to what they are priced online to keep people in stores rather than buy online. This ultimately fails bc people are very conscious about credit. Every brick store will be gone soon except stores like Walmart and clothing stores. They be around for a while bc both are a quick one shop stop for many things you need now. Clothing stores bc you don’t want to deal with buying clothing online and it not fitting.  They still ask about the BPPs (now it's Square Trades, though) Along with TRU credit cards, loyalty cards and batteries!    And, no kids don't want toys anymore. They don't have time to play with toys in between eating, sleeping and watching (and sometimes interacting with) the various screens their parents buy them. (I had a couple ask them what **tablet** would be right for their SEVEN MONTH OLD, for god's sake!)  Source: guess where I work? I'm going to guess Wal-Mart because I work there and I've had similar questions, though thankfully for children whose ages are measured in years instead of months. Kids who haven't even entered grade school yet very definitely do not need a tablet. FAO Shwartz...? Thats because toys are neutered versions of what they were. Toys have been stripped down to the bare minimum of manufacturing. The only manufacturer that this is not true for is Lego. Every other toy brand now builds cheap shitty versions of toys that used to last for decades that you are lucky if they last a few weeks.  The bonuses are only paid if certain financial targets are met next year. The management aren’t the same people as those responsible for bankrupting the company (and if they are and continue to do a poor job, they won’t get paid). The people being paid aren't the people who messed it up. They've [the ones who messed up Toys R Us] gone to spend more time with their families. I would imagine it's an inherited mess. That's where clawback provisions in executive compensation plans come into play.  They prevent incompetent and crooked executives from profitting off mismanagement and bankruptcy. &gt; Their probably in this predicament because of poor management  I assure you *they’re* probably not. A company failing is almost never the fault of any one person or even several specific people. In this case, I would say it had to do with shifting markets and Toys R Us taking too long to respond and adapt. That doesn’t mean the CFO, the Controller, accounting executives, HR managers, etc. did anything wrong or couldn’t provide value to other companies.  Executive bonuses actually make up a majority of pay, and depending on the company, 16 million is relatively small. However I agree that ceo pay should reflect how a business is doing, if they're doing shit they make shit.  Being paid by stock share seems to work a bit better for this, but still leads to working more for the stockholders and board members. Very few are willing to pull a costco, in fact it looks like their new ceo is taking a pay increase but will still be within the 1 million mark. Hell being a mid level manager is stressful enough but I'd probably only be a major ceo for half a million if I know the business is doing well, and I have flexibility to do things my way instead of pushing bs plans or every metric imaginable. The corporate life is soul crushing, it takes a certain type of individual. I don't think Toys R Us did any one thing to fail though, they're simply among the victims of online shopping and transitioning into...whatever the hell we're headed toward.  They kept stores open, lights on, and employees paid so what could you possibly hold against them?  It's not like they committed some atrocity against consumers and the public by trying to run their business. Ok, I get this, and the overall argument. But as a redditor who loves to hate, I still am hating on these execs who are collecting money dramatically in excess of what I will spend in my entire lifetime, for leading a company through a bankruptcy process that ultimately allows them to default on large swaths of debt.  It's great that "Mom &amp; Pop" investment capital is not used, and that these "Vulture Capitalists" pay these bonuses instead, but it increasingly strikes me as a shell game for the 1% (ultra-rich, executive class, whatever you want to call them) to pass [effectively] unlimited amounts of money from crony to crony.    It looks crooked. It smells crooked. It feels crooked.    Now, it is, or it isn't. But I think we all know, on some level, that it most definitely is. The number of people that can successfully lead a multi-billion dollar company through bankruptcy and place the company on the path to recovery is incredibly small. You could argue how much they "deserve", but getting a bonus certainly isn't crooked.   The better argument is the "golden parachute", where executives are paid out millions when they completely fail and fuck up a company. &gt;The number of people that can successfully lead a multi-billion dollar company through bankruptcy and place the company on the path to recovery is incredibly small.   While that sounds plausible, it sounds much more like what these executives would like me to believe.  And when you consider that the men and women in this executive class are cut from the same cloth and made of the same stuff as you and me, and are in no way guaranteed to be the smartest, most skilled and savvy people on the planet, I think lots of these executive compensation packages is a formal gilding scam being run by the rich on the rest of us. The Panama Papers scandal points to trillions of dollars that these ultra-rich have simply removed from the global economy and parked in tax havens for their children's children's grandchildren; or for buying influence; or for protecting and insulating themselves from the legal consequences of criminal activity.  And yet, there's still no shortage of people saying that these people actually DESERVE these ludicrous amounts of money.     I'm not buying it. They're running an elaborate game on us.  You’re not paying a doctor to give you drugs. Any schmo could walk down to the pharmacy, grab some pills, and tell you to go nuts. You’re paying the doctor to know which pill to get for you. The doctor and I took the same classes in undergrad, hell mine might even have been tougher, but he’ll get paid way more than me because he learned more past that and, critically, has very special experience to back it up.   You don’t think that their special experience is worth $16MM? That’s fine, don’t pay your retention teams that much. But this $16MM isn’t yours, and the people who it does belong to think it’ll save them money in the long run. If they’re wrong, they will be the ones who get burned when the whole thing falls apart.  There’s a lot of sketchy things that go on in the finance world, where public funds end up covering private risk. But this isn’t that. This is a pool of stakeholders making a decision that they think will salvage as much as possible from what turned out to be a bad investment. What evidence do you have that they’re cut from the same cloth. If you could do that job wouldn’t you be doing it? They, much like LeBron or Jordan, have a skill you don't have that produces $$$ you can't produce.  That's why they get paid more than you do. Don't be salty about basic economics. One thing you're failing to account for is the compensation that these executives could collect at another company. Whether we'd like to admit it or not, they have a skill - or a least the ability to sell a skill - that few people have. Companies are currently desperate for talent and the market is prime for these execs to find another job paying similar compensation - all at what is considered "market compensation" for their job and skillset.  Toys "R" Us paying market rate or above market rate to encourage ranking executives to stay with the company through an extremely risk time is a great move.   If your company filed for bankruptcy and you could find another job with competitive pay, back by a company not in bankruptcy, would you stay at the bankrupt company or take the other job? I think the better argument is if you do successfully pull out of a bankruptcy and make the company profitable again, you should absolutely be rewarded with an appropriate bonus.  You should not be paying out large bonuses simply for trying. This isn’t kindergarten. I think there is nothing appropriate about this at all. It's a little less dramatic than that.  Yes, these people are all overpaid, but they're by and large independent actors with long careers, not "cronies" (although that is sometimes the case).  They aren't conspiring with the "vulture capitalists," rather they are on the other side of the table trying to get the best deal they can for themselves (the investors would like to pay them the smallest amount possible without losing them at the company).  The real underlying problem is that executives in general are massively overpaid in the first place, so it costs enormous sums of money to keep the "talent" at the company.  This environment is the product of years of upward pay ratcheting thanks to compensation consultants (who are essentially paid by the CEOs to recommend higher pay for the CEOs), less-than-attentive boards/governance, and oftentimes too much executive influence/control over their own pay, which taken together creates an environment where pay is constantly increasing out of line with the rest of the economy.  You can also point at the lack of reinvestment in recent years, as a result of which corporations develop larger and larger cash hoards that they use for buy-backs, dividends, or exec comp rather than real capital expenditures for the future. Also, 16 million is NOTHING compared to the kind of money companies that large rake in normally. The one thing missing though is that this company was bought out by firms like KKR and Bain capital. They make their money back buy charging these companies fees of which they took over half a billion from. Still not going to completely cover their losses but these companies are shit.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2017/09/25/bankrupt-toys-r-us-was-crippled-by-bain-kkr-debt.amp.html I got hired at BRU HQ in NJ about 2 years ago. 2 months in they restructured and I lost my job.  It was such a depressing moment, it was a dream job for me in a dream company, the campus was great and I was really excited to work there.  I had been a TRU fan since I was a kid (obviously) and I had a lot of love lost for TRU since then because they stuck with the "family friendly" attitude and refused to sell M games, so I didn't shop TRU for games anymore. Their "business plan" ensured they'd lose me as a customer.  Worse yet, their pipeline / infrastructure for deliveries could have absolutely destroyed GameStop / Amazon had they had they adopted the internet instead of worrying it would cannibalize their sales. They *could have been the biggest company in Toys / Games but chose not to*.  I was really excited to start working there, I had that little dream that I could maybe be one of those people where my coworkers say "he really helped this company".  Oh well. &gt; The one thing missing though is that this company was bought out by firms like KKR and Bain capital.  True..  but KKR and Bain aren't complete vampires.  They're usually hired by the executive board to arrive at _exactly_ the situation in the headline.  They raided the company and they're still getting their bonuses..  because they hired the best company in the business to get it done for them.  It's less Goodfellas and more Gordon Gekko.  I hope it’s a really fancy jelly of the month club [deleted] Ignorance, on *my* Reddit? I don’t have a problem with this. Then again, I don’t think I really get it. These are incentive bonuses yes? Paid to the top 17 executives if their financial goals are met this holiday season. Why are people taking issue with that? Please don’t flame me lol, I’m very ignorant on issues like this just trying to better understand.  And 16 million to 17 people is not ridiculous. That's kind of a reasonable reward for saving a failing company. You're looking at the facts logically, not emotionally. If my previous experience of working there is any indication of the future, they will never hit that mark. I worked during the holidays as a seasonal worker last Christmas, and we were apparently the largest toys r us within a few states. We lost money almost everyday in December, nobody came in besides on Black Friday. Everyday there were 200, 300, sometimes even 400 ship from store orders to fill. People don't want to drive to the store and deal with any hassle in getting what they want when it's so easy to click a few buttons on your computer to obtain it. You're delusional if you think they'll make it through this restructuring without paying incentive bonuses.  Bonuses are for closers only. What I don't understand is why the market values these kinds of deals. Can you not found people who will accept being execs and not be subject to an enormous Bonus/payout? When is reddit going to grow the fuck up, stop being childish and learn how the world works? They are executives. Of a giant company. And they get like 1 million in bonuses, each. What seems to be so hard to understand? The first question really is, "What does the $16 million mean to creditors? Is it 50% or 0.005%?"  Once that fact is known, it might be a "who cares" if the significance is tiny.  But once the amount of the retention bonus starts looking like big money, the more the bankruptcy process needs to listen to the choice of the creditors.  They may want the money for themselves or are content with paying the bonuses to hope for greater success and a share in a later recovery from ongoing operations.  Or creditors could want a mix of options.   I mean, the creditors had to approve the chapter 11 plan, and the court has to approve anything outside of normal business expenses, so the safeguards guaranteeing creditor input are there.  This clickbait was posted here a week or two ago and the top comment gave a rational explanation then too. But the people who upvote the headline without engaging the article or the discussion will go on perpetuating their ignorance. Yay Yay! Trickle down, right guys? I can't wait to get a taste!  People that do not receive bonuses as part of their pay, tend to hear the word bonus as "extra or unwarranted pay". That is a misnomer.   I work in an industry where I am guaranteed bonuses, the amount differs, but that is part of my earnings.   Yeah when did bonus stop meaning 'something extra you get for doing an especially good job' and start meaning 'a normal part of expected compensation that's different from regular wages probably for dodgy tax purposes'?  I dont remember hearing about the change over. The main reason is to ensure these executives don't jump ship and let the company tank. Company tanks and everyone loses their jobs. Allowing an incentive for Execs to stay is an attempt to keep the ship floating. If you're poor and you fail, it's all your fault. If you're rich and you fail, it's everybody else's fault.  Innocent until proven poor. They only get the bonuses if the company hits financial targets Who is saying that?  I support chapter 11 because it saves people's jobs and I support public assistance for those who need it.    Quit trying to pretend this is a dichotomy.  You are comparing apples and oranges. What does that have to do with this? This [partially explains why Toys "R" Us went bankrupt after a leveraged buyout by Bain Capital](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/why-private-equity-firms-like-bain-really-are-the-worst-of-capitalism-20120523) Sixteen million reason to not shop there as they stiff their suppliers, screw their employees. I get that they need the best execs to save their ship but is the ship even worth saving..probably not. Same execs failed to right this ship for years Paying out bonuses is a contractual obligation for large companies.  Its the right thing to do.   Should those same bonuses be contracted for next year, then the shareholders should take issue with it, and I guess the rest of us can care if we want, but there's nothing wrong with paying their obligations this year. By definition, a bankrupt company is probably going to fail to make some contractually obligated payments. Some suppliers may have already delivered toys and need cash for their own emplyees etc.   Its up to the bankruptcy court to decide which ones Toys R Us should pay.  Problem with that logic is that bankruptcy proceedings allow companies to get out of some of their contractual obligations (e.g. not pay or only partly pay creditors and suppliers). Sooooo you're at the helm of a company who is doing so shitty it needs to file chapter 11, and you're marketable enough to go get another equal paying job?    I understand the bonuses to keep the ones already there to make the bankruptcy smoother, but then again I don't know enough of these execs job history (how long have they been with toys r us etc) to have a qualified opinion on the matter.     The person running it now is most likely not the one who got it there - most companies bring in new execs to try to fix things if theyre doing restructuring.  running a company is not easy - it's not always successful  it's easy to sit back and criticize headlines but realize that people don't run companies to make them bankrupt   Sounds about right for Dave Brandon. Right? I hate Dave Brandon with all my heart. This is obviously the Michigan alumni section of the comments.  Hiiii!!  *waves* I understand all of the arguments being made in favor of this, but if I am a small business owner with, say, a contract to clean a few Toys 'R Us stores in my town after hours, and they file bankruptcy and leave me with a few thousand in invoices that won't be paid, I'ma get a little touchy when I read about a few people who couldn't right the ship getting a million each before the inevitable sinking.
 so, if my dog so much as barks, a cop can shoot it... but these "trained" officers can't keep their mutt under control? and the mutt gets a better pension than you. Worse, if you shoot the dog in self defense you'd likely be charged with a major felony. The officer (Schmidt) seems to have a history of issues, including controlling his K9 previously, yet not only is he still a cop, he's still a cop in the K9 unit. WTF? Are they that short of cops up there? Sounds like he needs a promotion to get him out of the field so he can't do any more harm. K9s are crazy anyhow. I've trained a lot of dogs for personal defence, they'd never attack someone without a good reason. K9s are similar to the dogs you see thugs with walking around saying, "sick em." He pleaded guilty to a DUI.  That can get you fired from/prevent you for being hired for so many jobs.  But it's a slap on the wrist for someone whose duty is to "protect and serve." &gt;Police apologized to Collins while she was in the hospital, said Steve Linders, a St. Paul police spokesman.  that won't make her less afraid of the police or their dogs You can't show fear towards them or they will attack.  And the same goes for the dogs https://giphy.com/gifs/jon-hamm-7wfdPAnkqZFuw If my dog bit an innocent person while on a leash like that, it'd be put down. That was 100% handler fuckup.  Dog was doing his job, insofar as he understood it.  The handler failed to control his animal and should be fired. No failure here, this is par for the course for America. Look at all the videos and reports of police dog attacks, or police using police dogs in situations inappropriate for them.  In each and every case: you have someone screaming on the ground as the dog sinks its teeth into the poor guy's head or arm, and all the cops do is vaguely beg it to stop while tugging on the leash.  To someone who knows how dog handling or police dog handling is supposed to go, these are gross failures on the part of the handler. As far as American police are concerned, this IS the standard. Just as it would be 100% handler fuckup if my dog bit an innocent person while on a leash. Handler fuckup doesn't mean it doesn't get put down. But your dog is not a K9 unit.  This dog is literally trained to bite people, putting it down when it does that makes no sense.  It's the handling officer's job to control the animal, and allow it to bite the suspect only, and only if necessary. Dude had way too much leeway on that leash. Not the animal's fault. You can’t blame a dog for being a dog. Especially not a highly trained dog doing what it has been trained to do.  so, do we put down the handler?  We'd probably need to make that a law first.  Laws for thee, not for me. so the handler is being charged with assault? oh that's right it's america... If your dog barked in a general direction of an LEO it would probably be put down. I can understand what you are trying to say, but there´s a difference here, of course the dog should never bite someone innocent, but he´s trained to bite suspects and your personal dog isn´t. The dog was doing his job and the handler couldn´t control him, the job of a dog that isn´t a K-9 dog is not to bite people or to act in any way shape or form aggressive to anyone in public. With a proper handler a K-9 dog does all the right things, but a private dog that is aggressive towards people on the street is really hard to be contained or retrained and the owner failed to train his/her dog from the beginning and the dog propably cant or wont be properly trained by his current handler, so you either put him for the rest of his life in a cage, put him down or let him bite the next person he comes across when he snaps. So really what you're saying is dogs are stupid and should have nothing to do with Police work? No, i'm saying they are doing what they are trained for. They were on the chase for a suspect which means the dog was propably given the commando to search for them and was on "high alert", which is why i cant understand them holding him on such a long leash. Dogs are really smart and they can understand a lot of things, but they have to be trained properly to do so. If the handler doenst do his job right, the dog will do stuff like this. Plenty of privately owned dogs are trained to bite strangers. When they maul innocent strangers, though, we still usually have them put down, regardless of that training, because improperly controlled dogs trained to attack strangers are considered a danger to the public, and having mauled an innocent stranger is evidence of improper control.  Maybe that shouldn't be our response, but it currently is, and I don't see any particular reason that police dogs should be an exception to our laws on the treatment of dangerous improperly controlled dogs. Like I said these private dogs normally have nobody that has the time or just were steered so much in the wrong direction, so they "cant" be trained to be normal or just normal guard dogs. I would love for dogs that bite to be rehabiliated by a dog trainer but the reality sadly is, most of the time there is nobody that wants to do that.   I dont know how it is exactly handled in the US, but I know from a story in Germany where an off-duty police dog bit someone and that dog was put down, maybe there is a difference being made between off and on-duty for these dogs and thats why this dog does not have to be put down.  I also want to add that I think that most police dogs have the basics of what they are supposed to do and what not to do, meaning they have the proper basics to be build up on to get the dog to being a good K-9 dog, whereas private dogs that are agressive against people have never learned the right way to respond to people.  I recently had an encounter on a popular tourist site with a dog, where I asked the owner if I could pet the dog from a bit away and as I was in about 2 m range the dog just went berzerk and "defended" his owner and got praise for it. That is an example for a dog that shouldnt be out on the streets theres something bound to happen and that dog thinks hes doing everything right and never learnt it better and until he bites someone and i honestly think you can't train the dog to react any other way and he will bite again and again which is just a risk to the general public. Edit: https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/weltgeschehen/article111493398/Bayerischer-Polizeihund-faellt-sechs-Kinder-an.html  Link for the article with the incident in Germany. Sadly it is in German, but the general sense is, the dog owner is being charged with assault and the dog which was still in training is being checked on by proffesionalls of the police if it has to be put down or can be trained. If your dog even looked an [officer while wagging it's tail, it would be put down.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/07/what-dog-shootings-reveal-about-american-policing/533319/) They just stood there and looked at her screaming in the beginning...... Then surely trying to pull her away from the dog would just cause her skin to rip more? That's what I was wondering. I'm not sure what procedure they're supposed to use, but wouldn't pulling her in one direction while pulling the dog in the other just make him bite down harder?  I used to have to pry my dog's jaws open to make him release whatever he's chewing on. It looked like they were afraid to tell the dog it was doing a bad thing.  Even though that person was innocent they still want their dog to be trained to attack people, if they told their dog it was doing something wrong then next time it wouldn't do it.  But it still should have been trained well enough to cease on command, poorly trained dog and poorly trained handlers.  So the dog ignored multiple commands from its handler to release her, bit down harder on her, and had to be physically removed from her? Don't cops routinely shoot violent and aggressive dogs like this one?   &gt; In a statement on Thursday, Police Chief Todd Axtell said his “heart breaks” when he sees body camera footage of the incident.  Nobody cares if his heart breaks. His wallet is what needs to break. And that dog needs to be put down. It is obviously improperly trained and unable to respond to whatever training it did supposedly have. It is just another violent and aggressive dog that represents a danger to the community at large. Whoever trained that dog should be fired for incompetence. &gt;Don't cops routinely shoot violent and aggressive dogs like this one?  [nope, just the non-violent ones](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/07/what-dog-shootings-reveal-about-american-policing/533319/)   Why didn't she shoot the dog? It's just a dog, they can buy another... 👮 That is assault on an office you will be murdered for that.  no, it's property destruction. but yeah, probably will be killed by a low-IQ cop with a badge and gun On duty K9s are considered officers for legal purposes. They are not, that is a myth. They are police animals, not officers. Unless a cop locks one in a car in and it dies, then it's just a dog again.  Just one of the magical dualities of police dogs. I'd say you could make a good self defense case if you manage to avoid the being murdered part. I believe they meant the cops shooting the dog. They have no problem doing that to citizens' pooches. But the second amendment is supposed to allow us to protect ourselves from the mean government :( Defending your life from Officer Snookums surely counts. The dog should have been shot and I hope she gets millions. They apologized? Fuck that! They just stood there and watched. Could have used a non lethal weapon on the obviously out of control dog, instead of petting it while it bites her.  Police dogs have zero purpose. They cant reliably produce accurate results. It's not the dog's fault. It's the cop that needs to be put down. How do we know that trash bag wasn't loaded? That woman was clearly resisting arrest.
 &gt;Verheul said that Canada wants a net neutrality provision included in NAFTA, noting:  &gt;"We are including provisions such as online consumer protection to ensure that that is provided for and we also have provisions to provide personal information protection, which we feel is essential in this kind of trade, along with our position that we want to protect net neutrality when it comes to digital trade."  This is potentially golden. You can't pass a law that negates a treaty with a foreign nation. Trump won't make this deal but if a future president did it would restore Net Neutrality for all of us in a way that couldn't simply be overturned by the next fascist regime. It’s a good plan, but I don’t think you know what fascism is.  did I define fascism somewhere? (I must have missed that part of my post.) Good to see America standing up for what's right! (...the US isn't the only nation in The Americas.) Then it's not America standing up for what's right, it's a subsection. If everyone in a company supports child labor apart from one division, that doesn't mean the company stands up for what's right. 
 Didn't we have someone in an askreddit thread warn of this exact thing like a week ago?  It was like a few days ago IIRC, I guess someone took that seriously as they should. That was yesterday; and they were talking about all data (due to software). According to the article, this breach was due to someone gaining access to email accounts that had PII *and PHI* in them. Sending PHI via email... That's like what not to do when you work with PHI 101 True. Also, thanks for the reminder that it was both PII and PHI. Maybe he is the one that casued it to happen haha If only we had someone that was really great with the cyber to deter these attacks! HFHS employee here - Most of upper management in IT right now have extremely puckered buttholes, and rightly so. How's your butthole doing? Loose as a goose.  It doesn't affect me much at all, I'm just a low-level IT lackey.   What ehr system are you using?  EPIC.  We spent over half of a billion dollars revamping our system to become compliant with the ACA.  Before that, we were using Care Plus Next Generation. As a cyber security professional who has made many many attempts at trying to connect with your executive team regarding this exact issue.. I am not sure what to say. It really does not talk about the scope. They have Henry Ford Hospitals in multiple areas. My hometown hospital just became part of them last year or maybe the year before that. Well its a ford. What did you expect.
 Renewables are causing disruption in the energy sector. GE, more positioned in fossil fuel power, is divesting, as is Siemens. We're in the middle of the tipping point toward renewable energy sources. Whether you think it's good or bad, it is happening. Siemens just spun off half their wind stake to Gamesa last year. They have been firing a bunch of people in the wind division. The wind plant in Kansas is basically non existent right now. The power industry as a whole is slow. Yea, Siemens recently closed down a factory that made Wind Turbine parts in Ontario, CA. Yet, some in the media painted their job cuts announcement as a sign of fossil fuels waning.   People need to realize that these multi-national conglomerates are buying into (and out of) different industries every year. Every so often they have to consolidate their operations or lessen their risk if one sector gets soft.  For example, many of these cuts that GE announced are happening in Switzerland, where they recently made huge acquisitions in the past few years.    In Ontario the plant only existed because of government subsidies, Ontario has a surplus of power so it cut the subsidy, and they closed the plant.  In NA at least, most of the plants are  operating because of large subsidies to this point. Thanks. I looked that up. Siemens  is also moving away from gas. The article states that a driving force is the renewables market. Volatility in energy right now. Disruption. &gt;GE, more positioned in fossil fuel power, is divesting, as is Siemens.  GE bought Baker Hughes a while back, how is that divesting? So it's now the hip thing to blame renewable energy instead of automation?  I'm so behind on the times. I've worked in that building! It's a shame that GE was allowed to purchased Alstom/ABB and now are just going to shut them down. At least they were forced to sell off some of the Alstom business units by anti-trust regulators.    &gt;It's a shame that GE was allowed to purchased Alstom/ABB and now are just going to shut them down.      Huh?  [They just sold their Industrial Solutions business *to* ABB.](http://fortune.com/2017/09/25/ge-industrial-solutions-abb-sale/)    That's a different business. Alstom and ABB are both still around as separate entities. But the gas turbine division of ABB was purchased by Alstom many years ago, and recently that same business was purchased by GE, and these are the offices that they are now closing.  Caterpillar laid off thousands right before a recession too. GE has a reputation as a good, smart company. Why didn’t they get ahead of alternative power? It’s been known to be the only option for the future, for decades. That's what's happening. Not all of the skill sets are going to directly transfer.  GE has been struggling for many years. They were heavily invested in the financial sector going into the century, which they managed to mostly divest from, but there are a lot of painful decisions to make before it turns around.  The stock has lost about 45% of it's value over the last year.   https://www.economist.com/news/business/21722663-amid-whirlwind-dealmaking-ges-returns-lag-jeff-immelts-record-shows-pitfalls     https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-06-12/jeff-immelt-successor-at-ge-will-have-to-finish-what-he-started     https://hbr.org/2017/10/why-ges-jeff-immelt-lost-his-job-disruption-and-activist-investors   IMO they should have never broken apart and sold GE Capital.  Although the margins weren’t as good as their industrial side it was a good cash cow for them and accounted for 40-60% of their revenue, even in the recession.  Again big companies making short term decisions to appease stock holders. Interestingly enough, from Jack Welch: "On the face of it, shareholder value is the dumbest idea in the world," Welch said, "Shareholder value is a result, not a strategy…your main constituencies are your employees, your customers and your products." Jack Welch is full of shit, nothing new.  They where working on generators for wind turbines in the middle 90s. I was at GE Transportation during that time. Locomotive traction motors and alternators make really good turbine generators. IIRC, it was really slow, as a business, then. But I haven't worked for GE since around ~2000. Thats hardly a universally held opinion. They purchased a major competitor in the gas and steam turbine sector (Alstom) out of bankruptcy and are now going to shut them down. It wouldn't surprise me if this was their plan all along. Thankfully, they were forced to sell off major portions of Alstom and subsidiaries by anti-trust regulators.  &gt; GE has a reputation as a good, smart company.  GE is known to not pay their share in taxes yet they gain the most with these tax cuts. But, but... corporations were supposed to be creating jobs with all their new tax cuts!! Well, they purchased an overseas competitor and are now essentially shutting them down. Presumably this will strengthen their original US based power business with heavy presence in New York and South Carolina. Although they've already been having layoffs in the US business this year.  Alstom was non-profitable prior to the GE purchase and needed yet another state bail out from France. France was not going to provide that bailout due to economic issues within the country. Alstom was going to be purchased by someone, be it GE, Siemens, MHI, etc. Whomever ended up with Alstom was going to make cuts in duplicated employees and other areas where cost could be cut.  https://tradingeconomics.com/alo:fp:net-profit-margin  * They were bailed out in 2003 * They showed negative margin in 2014, higher than in 2003  Siemens just got done with a massive layoff as well (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-siemens-power-restructuring/siemens-to-cut-6900-jobs-to-tackle-flailing-turbines-business-idUSKBN1DG257) that was announced in mid-November. The number for GE is based on them finally consolidating from the Alstom acquisition and the down turn in the fossil power market.  If Siemens had purchased Alstom, they would have the big number and GE would have the small number.  At least wait for the tax cuts. And here we have Trickle Down economics, folks. Give billion dollar corporation massive tax breaks to "grow the economy" and they cut 12,000 jobs.  Yes, the just passed tax bill instantaneously went into effect already! GE has always got these breaks. This is not new. The amount of breaks is higher but corporations claiming to "grow our economy" with those breaks is consistent. Ford motor company is moving to Mexico. This is what the American people get in return for those breaks.  Get off'n it.  Reverse the parties and you'd be doing the same fucking thing.  Fact we have historical evidence (reaganomics, FUCKING KANSAS) that trickle down is a terrible terrible idea that does not work.  If we start seeing massive layoffs coming up, its because corporations are aware of this and are gearing up to weather it out yet again.
 &gt; Data was frozen on dozens of Mecklenburg County servers after one of its employees opened an email attachment carrying malicious software earlier this week.  We have IT Security courses at my job that basically say "don't fucking open emails that you don't recognize and especially don't open the attachments."   Glad to see they were able to fall back on non-digital stuff to keep processes running, albeit at a slower pace. I work for an MSP, you can literally have the training session and five minutes later you have people emailing you that they accidentally opened something and put in all of their creds. People just are not smart, it's pretty frustrating to see in day to day.  In fact, in dealing with this this morning with one of our smaller clients who did the same, luckily it appears to be a Trojan and a simple wipe and reload will fix. But still, people are fucking dumb as nails and so nonchalant about it.  I always see people saying oh how can this happen when a data breach goes down. If you work in IT you know exactly how it can go down, it's like herding fucking cats dealing with users. &gt;it's like herding fucking cats dealing with users.  This sums up working in IT. There needs to be some sort of stepped punishment of sorts for this sort of thing.  If the user does it once, okay, innocent mistake.  But let them know if they do it a second time, their supervisor will be notified.  Then if they do it a second time, notify their supervisor that they seem to have a problem with security routines and/or computer skills and need more training.    If there's no ramifications for being willfully carefree with company equipment, they'll continue to abuse this privilege.  I don't see it as deliberate, but when you know the computer isn't yours, you don't give as much of a fuck as you would if it were your shit at risk. In theory I agree, but the reality is that you will have users who will be afraid to report IT issues because they'll be worried that the problem they're noticing is their fault. And that's not a good situation either.  Organizations need to invest in their networks. Pay for an MSP who regularly monitors your networks, rolls out updates and notifies you if your systems are becoming obsolete. If you have an internal IT team, give them a budget for network upgrades and regular training.   Not that I don't think that you should be fired for misusing company equipment. If you're using your company computer to browse pornhub, you absolutely deserve to lose your job. But making your users live in paralyzing fear of making a mistake isn't a good solution either.   True, and I was always very lenient about such things as I knew my users pretty well after a few years.  The last thing I ever wanted was to make my users afraid of reporting issues; sometimes that's inevitable because they think we're "too busy".  I'd always tell them I'd rather take 5 minutes to check their computer now as opposed to 5 hours restoring it later.  But there are some users who get trained ten ways to Sunday, all different methodologies for user education down to sitting next to them and talking in as plainspeak as possible, who *still* click that link or open that attachment.  Those are the users who need some sort of understanding of consequences that go beyond inconveniencing IT. Sadly, in my experience, those same users are also the same people in the organization who would be in charge of disciplinary action against a careless employee :(  &gt; people are fucking dumb as nails and so nonchalant about it.  Like it's a cute personality trait to be an idiot.  "Oh did I do that? Sorry, I'm just such an idiot sometimes.", they say before trotting off to grab another mocha latte or some shit. "I'm just not computer literate" shrug and that boy's is called Job Security, welcome to IT *!* It was adorable when Urkel said it BECAUSE HE DIDN'T FUCK THE COMPANY'S SERVERS UP! Sir, I am not a computer person and you are refusing to help me.  &gt; If you work in IT you know exactly how it can go down, it's like herding fucking cats dealing with users.  I work IT in Meck County, can confirm. One person at one client has been phished about 6 or 7 times from opening random emails that say "LOG IN WITH YOUR ACCOUNT", so they enter their account info and *heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy* here's some fresh "Login to download Secure Files from www.stealyogal.garbo/totallylegit/index.Dropbox.fart" emails from their account.  ...Thankfully I don't work for the county though so I'm not gonna get hit by this shitstorm. I feel for the IT guys over there, they're getting the brunt of this shit. Though I do have to question just how in the hell 48 different servers were hit. Technically all it takes is one unpatched server to get hit with EternalBlue and boom, gpos infecting every other server and PC on the domain. While true, it's the fact that it's government servers going unpatched and unprotected that's disheartening to me. Former MSP owner, can confirm.  The one big vacation I took I woke up the first morning to email and phone calls from an employee who infected their machine.  They managed to disable the managed anti-virus so they could "download music" on their office machine.  Got to sit on the balcony with 2 laptops and a tablet restoring backups as I watched my family play on the beach. I support the idea of doing something similar to pet shaming with stupid people like this. Unfortunately everyone gets all up in arms about "oh! this is hazing!" It isn't hazing, but you also don't want to alienate your userbase or they won't come to you when they DO have a problem.  Don't treat users with condescension and especially do not publicly shame them.  Try to educate them, on their level if the usual techniques are not working, so you have fewer problems in the future. Perhaps an IQ test should be part of the hiring process? Telecom Engineer chiming in but I really hope a Sys Admin can join the discussion here.  What kind of piss poor deployment/security do they have where a user can open an attachment and infect the server and not just their own machine?  That is just spectacularly bad.  Hell, I spend half of my day locking down SBCs in a fashion so no one person can exhaust all the resources or cause an outage.  It has to be the same for Sys Admins.   If the user has mapped drives to a fileserver, it can start working its way through the server files (that they have access to -- critical point -- proper procedure would be to limit their access to only that which they truly need access to do their jobs).  That's just one avenue.    I haven't read the article carefully but I noticed upon skimming that they have *500 servers*, 49 of which were apparently affected.  Maintained by a local in-house group or outsourced?  Do they really need 500 servers?  I get that it's a big county, I'm just curious as to why they haven't streamlined that a bit. &gt; What kind of piss poor deployment/security do they have where a user can open an attachment and infect the server and not just their own machine?  Speculating here but probably just a plain vanilla shared folder. Most of these viruses use windows SMB. We've sent I don't know how many emails saying this. It doesn't work.   I work helpdesk at a Community College in NC.   EVERY LEVEL OF employee is guilty of this stuff too.  I don't understand how opening an email and not opening attachments can harmful your computer, isn't that just plain text at that point? Rather certain you are correct but I've heard stories where unprotected email servers can be hit by just opening an email. That's less of the user's fault though. That is because people use Outlook. It shouldn't be an issue today, and realistically most people cannot avoid opening emails as part of their job. Embedded HTML in Outlook emails causes problems, but yes, it's business/mission-critical, so it's unavoidable.  This is why education is so important. Depending on your mail client, opening an HTML-formatted email might execute scripts and/or hit external sites for images/etc. Some of those could exploit vulnerabilities in the email client. Some businesses will even send out fake phishing emails to their own employees to see if they'll fall for it, and if they do, they get some mandatory training and probably a write up. Okay, but what about the ones who come from known addresses?  I teach.  I got one of these from an email address I had corresponded to for two years (taught two of three kids). I knew the address.  I didn’t click it because I was teaching. But I will admit, I wondered if she was reaching out for a recommendation or something.  It came up while I taught and in the two hours it took to get back to my machine, it had been flagged (not before three other teachers opened it).  Make the statements about people being dumb all you want.  Some of us are in jobs where we have to deal with the public and all their real and digital viruses.  Your IT department should limit the size of the attachments going in and out or just not allow attachments from external sources. They should also block attachments based on file extensions. Another good idea is to only allow plain text emails.  There are several other steps that could be done but these are very easy and very basic.  Can emails themselves even be malicious? I feel like an attachment HAS to be open. And I don't know who would do that  A lot of my IT work involves security as I do a lot of document/workflow automation and management solutions. Most companies and organizations save for Federal/Military do not want to spend a dime or can't on security measures. It's really pathetic how badly we are vulnerable across the country.   Don't want to spend a dime, or can't, or don't want their staff to take the time to do things right -- that's another one.  This shit used to keep me up at night panicking about how I'd handle it, knowing how vulnerable our systems were, but there wasn't anything I could do about it without resources and buy-in from upper management. Even if we could break the myth that passwords like "23fjH%kd(@" are somehow more secure then "doughnutbastardstinkpotrhino" we'd be better off, people can't even seem to understand that with this:  https://xkcd.com/936/  I honestly give up, I won't do IT security as a primary job because I sure as hell am not going to be the guy who gets destroyed when shit does go down.   Being in IT security means you know exactly what the risks are and how to communicate them, but that doesn't mean anyone up on high is listening or gives a shit.  And it also means you're first in the firing line.  "Why didn't you tell us about this vulnerability?"  This is where practicing good CYA can at least give you some measure of satisfaction... as you're shown the door anyway because you work in an at-will state.  /sigh Oh yep, luckily in my role now you'd have to be a complete idiot to get yourself in trouble. Anything security related or anything that could remotely be an issue as far as vulnerability I simply refer them to their general IT.  Had a customer from a very old, very big life insurance company more or less demand I set up a FTP server so he can scan in documents (couldn't use SMB due to device only supporting TLS 1.0). "Yea.. no, that's never going to happen. You'll have to ask your IT department to do that". He knew enough to know the machine can use FTP but didn't know enough to get it working :)  I really like being specialized in a few niche areas and doing just that. General IT management is a nightmare. &gt;General IT management is a nightmare.  I just got out of it and am debating what to do next.  Thanks for crystallizing why I feel such a sense of relief! Password hardness is a red herring. For the enormous majority of people, the only thing that really matters is not reusing passwords. Whether your password has N bits of entropy or 2N is meaningless. If they have backups what's the issue? Ransomware can be an inconvenience and you may lose a days work but this isn't a new thing anymore. Not having a proper backup system in place is just baffling at this point from SOHO to a government office of this size.  This is totally believable though. Far to often the individuals charged with making financial decisions choose not to invest in basic IT security and best practices. It's rampant now to hear of the attitude that "The IT department doesn't even do anything. Nothing is ever broken." Exactly, if nothing is broken that means your IT staff are doing an excellent job. But instead organizations will downsize or outsource or cut corners. The reality always sets in when something like this happens and that backup solution and the manpower to properly maintain it doesn't seem so bad when you're paying a ransom on top of the labor involved with standing the network back up and entering all the data that's been gathered on paper instead of digitally for an extended period.  Sadly, much like the larger situation with Equifax it will be the same IT people struggling to maintain order that become the scapegoat. (Unless of course it was just a lazy administrator, in which case it's deserved.) &gt;If they have backups what's the issue?  I suspect they either don't have backups or they don't routinely do test restores and they got a nice surprise when they tried to restore the data.   That was exactly my thought. Could just be PR saying they have a backup to not look incompetent. Or something I saw dozens of times in my past job was "Well there's a USB hard drive/NAS/something hooked up in there but we haven't checked in \*insert ridiculous amount of time*." That's the thing I can't emphasize enough. You should always have backups and you should ALWAYS do test restores on a routine basis. I promise if you don't, it will bite you in the ass. That's why I'm always still somewhat shocked when I keep seeing these massive failures of best practices in large scale and crucial environments. A person like me that is by no means a C level or an information security expert or even working in the enterprise space follows these basic procedures. How is it not happening in these networks and more importantly who is actually to blame? Maybe I'm giving too much credit to the skill level of the individuals tasked with maintaining the integrity of this data but it's not bleeding edge tech. Backup procedures were crucial long before ransomware became a major threat and in my years in IT it's always been one of the most overlooked tasks. I think a lot of the problem ties into one of your other comments about how IT is viewed. They don't want to pay for good people. They don't want to pay for an adequate number of staff, so things like this unfortunately get bypassed so the little staff they have can react to whomever is screaming the loudest about their current project.   These will be the same places that will look to find a single tech to blame when things like this happen. It's typically not a tech problem, it's a procedural and management problem. You're spot on. I've been doing this for a while now and a lot of this is well known in IT circles but somehow hasn't spread to management types.  In a lot IT if you want a raise you find a new job. You find a job that pays you market value and you move until you get the dollar to stress ratio you're looking for. When you leave you're offered a higher salary after being told that wasn't possible, then your replacement is paid a higher salary because the business has to pay market value to replace someone. It's a really stupid system but even here in the midwest I see it all the time and have been told it's similar across the US.  The same applies in management regarding IT. You see it with large vendors. A new CEO or CFO comes in, says too much is spent on support, outsources to India, money is saved and over time sales suffer causing a net loss and and a new CEO comes in and reverses the idea, rinse and repeat.  I did a few years work in MSP and sales so I've seen first hand over and over and over the attitude that technology and data are inconveniences and not assets. The most specific case being ransomware. I warned a client over and over they should at least invest in some USB hard drives to rotate and backup their one file server. Rougly $400 bucks for a weeks worth of drives to rotate. Wasn't worth it they said. Then ransomware hits and the labor alone to piece things back together from the salvageable data was four times the cost of the drives, not to mention the staff labor to reenter all the lost data. In the beginning it was insanely frustrating but eventually it comes down to the whole lead a horse to water thing.   It's not just the midwest. I live in the southeast and the salary system is very much the same.   That being said, I've been fortunate enough to have been working for a credit union the last couple of years that has had some members of the management team start to realize the importance of IT. It's been an interesting culture shift and odd watching those that see the value of IT clash with those with that older, legacy, mentality. I think every year more companies realize that you get what you pay for and that proper resources are needed in IT no matter what your business is. It's just going to be a very slow moving change. &gt; If they have backups what's the issue?  As others have mentioned, backups may not have been working correctly. Another possibility is the backups were also encrypted.  Ransomware has become very targeted - it's not always a 'drive-by' but often times an actor will spend days or weeks inside the network orchestrating the attack.  They will specifically look for the backup system and make sure that is encrypted as well.  I've seen them encrypted the local backup repo and find the off site replica and hit that too as their final steps.  With so many people not bothering with tape backups anymore, it's much easier to 'destroy' backups as well.  At the very least, the admin shares on your backup servers should be disabled. Keep in mind 'government' - especially local government - does not have an endless pile of money to keep up with the latest and greatest or even 'best practices' and they're usually trying to convince very old-school elected officials to loosen the purse strings to let them put proper DR and security measures in place.   e: “I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,” said Diorio. -- so they are going to restore from backup, that just takes awhile.   I agree that ransomware has wisely been evolved to deal with backups being the easiest means of recovery. But I disagree that it should be a problem to use some sort of rotating or secured backup procedure. Storage is dirt cheap anymore and with basic measures you can safely backup business critical data in some form or another. You're also definitely correct that it's very possible the IT staff were butting heads with the people in charge of budgets in regards to having a proper backup solution. I'm personally biased on the situation but I see it as a person of power ignoring the advise of qualified staff, occasionally just for the sake of what comes across as "I'm the boss."  It's still inexcusable for a county of this size to not have something in place though, especially after dozens of other widely reported stories of the exact same thing happening. My largest complaint with these stories is when I see IT staff made into the scapegoat because of the decisions made by management or supervisors. If my local government was moving at a crawl it would be an improvement.  [deleted] That's three The failure trigger is in the last sentence.  That whole pesky "follow" rule doesn't always translate well. We have tripled the amount of training given to employees in order to prevent these breaches.  It's still not nearly enough.   As a Systems Engineer, I can say that people, not passwords, are the weak link in any organization. You can get the info you need for anything by just sounding convincing.   However, that doesn't give me an excuses to not keep my servers and hosts up-to-date and not pay attention to the latest trends in the security world. This is just stupidity in the form of information technology.  They could have easily asked for more, so considering they are probably about to hire out someone new, then I can't imagine that it would end up costing them too terribly much in the whole scheme of things. At this point I am blaming the victims. How many other attacks, how many warnings do people need to back up their stuff and practice good data hygiene?  I work in a County IT department that also services several towns. We come across ransomware a couple times a year. For the most part, it just bricks the employees computer. One town had a Police officer download an attachment that bricked their server. It has Carbonite on it, but they only opted for the basic plan which seemed to have throttled downloads. They never knew this and only tested backups with one or two  folders.  It took 3 days just to download the backup.  Another guy bricked his machine and told us his department would pay the ransom because he had 10 years worth of data stored locally instead of storing in the cloud or file server, which we made available to everyone, but had not "forced" them to use it. The administration denied his request because they didn't want to end up on the front page of the news and said it was his fault for not listening to IT.  Ransomware happens alot. Listen to your IT department.  "hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran."  That's like saying: maybe in Florida or Saskatchewan. Occasionally my company will send out (via third party) a spam or phishing email with a link or attachment.  They can tell if you open it and then you get sent for additional IT Security training. I get to monitor the general "contact@companyname.com" email address as part of my job. It always makes me laugh how many emails we get along the lines of "This is your bank you use for business money. Your account is locked, reply with your bank details or you won't have any money".  Simply stripping all attachments from emails would prevent most ransomware attacks. Governments need to assemble a global task force that can legally enforce cyber security, and arrest hackers giving them very harsh penalties.  Not sure if you’re joking or really this ignorant.
 I think that should be greeted as a positive by just about everybody.. CAIR would call you Islamophobic. CAIR is a hate group. Of course there's people who wouldn't greet it as positive, but when someone says "just about everybody" they mean the middle 95% of the US. &gt;CAIR is a hate group  CAIR is a fifth column.  I've never heard the term "[fifth column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_column)" until today, had to look it up. Examples of CAIR spreading hate?  Wasnt CAIR linked with the Muslim Brotherhood and other radical Islamic groups? They received money directly from a Hamas (Muslim Brotherhood) money laundering front called the Holy Land Foundation. I may be a little confused here but I thought Hamas and Muslim Brotherhood were two different organizations? They're two wings of the same group. MB is the "clean" political party and Hamas is the "dirty" guerrilla fighting force. How can that be true? Isn't Muslim Brotherhood Sunni and Hamas Shia?  You may be confusing Hamas and Hezbollah.  Hamas is Sunni. I suggest you look them up on Wikipedia to start with. They don't actively do it. They are more insidious than that. The CAIR organization itself is "above-board", however their insidiousness comes via their membership. They are a "fifth column" organization (google the term if you need to). There is indisputable evidence that many of their members have ties to foreign organizations which have openly and/or secretly funded or provided material aid to terrorists and/or terrorist groups. They were implicated (directly) but not charged in a money laundering scheme for the Muslim Brotherhood, for example. Source?  I can't find a single reputable article confirming this. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Land_Foundation_for_Relief_and_Development  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Check_from_terrorist_organization_HLF_to_Islamic_organization_CAIR.jpg They're like an Animals Right organization that is a cover for poachers or an Human Rights Organization by a dictator to offer cover.   they've been named as an unindicted co-conspirator in like 10 Federal cases Reputable sources are important, you shouldn't be downvoted for requesting truth. Any time you say anything bad about anyone who's done anything wrong and who follows islam, that's *obviously* islamophobic. But the guy must not have been homophobic. That'd go against the narrative. Has CAIR issued a statement about this? Please dont assume all of us condone terrorism. Im a muslim, I hope she gets life  for aiding and abetting 49 murders. There could also be an Islamic argument she should get the death penalty That's why I said CAIR, not Muslims. I'm a White native born American, ideally my demographic should fit in with people who hate Muslims in this country. I'm mainly Athiest, but there is an open house at a mosque in my city coming up, I don't intend to convert, but I intend to at least know more about Muslims before I jump onto the boat of hating them which seems to be so popular in this country.   Personally,  I think it's hard being Muslim in this country. Ignore the negative comments. Go through with that plan. It's about experiencing and understanding, you can't blindly hate someone after spending a day with them.   Fundamentalism is everywhere, in all religions. Americans have a lot of trouble identifying and admitting a huge chunk of them are religious fundamentalists. As if christians are immune to it...  The more you learn about their religion the more you'll despise it, as an atheist if there anything you don't like in Christianity it's in Islam except it's worse.  You can despise the religion without despising it's followers. Especially since people tend to be born into a religion. never said you couldn't. And they are indoctrinated into it as kids not born into it. It's a religion. What's in it is almost entirely defined by what the person practicing it wants to be in it. That is a very protestant viewpoint.... a viewpoint that, notably, does not exist in Islam. That's not how that works, maybe kind of in the west but not in the middle east. Wow, you are such a virtuous person. Satan hates him... Hard being Muslim here?  What a joke. Do you know where it’s really hard being a Muslim?  In Muslim majority countries.  It's interesting that there seemed to be a big push to make everyone think Mateen was just a closet homosexual, not a terrorist...but she's being charged with aiding a terror organization. So it seems he was a closet terrorist, actually. I mean, there is no reason they cant both be true and both be a factor.  The FBI looked into the claims he was gay and found they were unsupported and some just down right lies. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Mateen#Investigation_into_claims  A bit of info for those interested.  &gt;On June 23, the Los Angeles Times reported that the FBI has found no evidence "to support claims by those who say Mateen had gay lovers or communicated on gay dating apps."  &gt;a man who self-identified as Mateen's lover-of-two-months, "Miguel", had said that he believed the massacre was out of revenge against Latino men when Mateen learned he may have been exposed to HIV from a Puerto Rican man with whom he had sex, but Mateen's autopsy results confirmed that he was HIV-negative.  &gt;On June 25, The New York Times reported that after exhaustive investigation with help from the FBI, the gay dating network Adam4Adam concluded that Mateen had never used its app  &gt;Furthermore, the article stated that after 500 interviews, the FBI has not found any evidence of homosexuality "through (Mateen's) web searches, emails or other electronic data"  All of this is news to me, I've thought he really was gay. The situation is totally confusing, like, why? What is there to achieve by painting him gay? It’s an attempt to discredit the idea he slaughtered all those people in the name of allah, which he explicitly stated he was doing as the massacre was happening.  Why did the Obama state department  A)  Refuse to release the 911 calls in which Mateen claimd allegiance to Isis;  B)  Give in, but only release a transcript in which they changed Mateen's words of "Allah" into "God."  C)  Finally release the unedited audio (after many months) but still downplay any connection to Islamic extremism?  We all know the answer. A gay man so oppressed by society, so torn with internal strife that he had no choice but to lash out at the sexual urges that consume him, lured by a terrifying instrument of death plays way better to the modern left than some shitbag Islamic fundamentalist terrorist doing what they do, yet again. No it was done in order to take away from the fact that it was a Terrorist attack. Instead they claimed he was an oppressed homosexual and lashed out because of how terrible society was on him.  That's^exactly^what^he^said. For the past year fake news had you successfully brainwashed. And you ask why they do it? Because it works! Because it was an election year and CNN didn't wanna make it seem like there really is a problem with Islam, or Daesh agents that live here. As someone who lives in Orlando - apparently the first big push in the "closeted gay rage" direction was that someone made a fake Grindr with his pictures like the day after the event.   So a lot of people saw him on there and freaked out. And then it just spread via people looking for attention.  What was achieved was to cast doubt that the guy was just a normal jihadist.  In other words, it was a ....lets just say misguided attempt to protect Islam.  lol remember when CNN had an exclusive interview with the terrorist's gay lover? Yeah, what was that guys name?  I think it was Fiften Minsofame? 2016 election was a crazy time, I like to think we've snapped back  a bit from that sort of "journalism" but I know i shouldn't. Remember when the shooters father showed up at a Hillary rally just days later. Completely bizarre.  Do you remember when he showed up , Hillary's people gave him reserved ( specifically approved ) seating behind the podium ? Yes. Truly bizarre. Here is the photo.   https://imgur.com/a/A6jHa Check the top posts on reddit this past week Trump really made the media froth at the mouth and act in an entirely self-destructive way trying to take him down. It was very sad seeing some of my favorite news organizations throw their journalistic standards to the side if it meant supporting their narrative. The Pissgate "dossier", The Scaramucci fiasco, Mateen's made-up homosexuality, and so many more. And let's not forget that time CNN doxxed and Blackmailed a guy who made a Trump meme, threatening to publicly release his identity if he ever criticized them again.  Trump didn't make them do anything. All he did was show you who they really are. People willing to throw away their integrity so easily did not have any to begin with.  Have you seen how many have been fired or quietly let go. I don't know if I have seen so many accused of sexual misconduct or poor journalistic integrity. The thing is so many of these people were Trumps biggest accusers.  I'd like to think that too. And then I look at the news. I think it was a meme that became viral helped by some people who had motive to shift the narrative away from jihadist terrorism. I agree, I'm just saying that either the media or the government seemed to be pushing the closet homosexual thing and downplaying the terrorist theory.  Of course they pushed for the gay route. They don't want to talk about Muslim Terrorism. Why would they not want to talk about it?  Goes against the "brown skinned people are universally innocent"-narrative. How about the "all humans are capable of doing horrible things"? Is that a dumb narrative? Or is their something that extremely important about their melanin that make people act in certain ways? That's a huge conflation. Not wanting people to generalize entire ethnic groups (sometimes incorrectly) as terrorists is not the same as universally innocent.  When this happened the San Bernadino shooting was still in the public's memory, and Europe was going through the refugee crisis while Obama/State Department was wanting to increase the number of Syrian refugees we brought in. You can't have the public seeing two people, muslim and by most outward appearances assimilated, be shown as violent threats.  ...you know those quotation marks are there for a reason... The government can't stop talking about fucking Muslim terrorism. No matter what else is going on or whether it's remotely relevant.  Some white dude kills or injures almost 600 people and still all we talk about is Muslim terrorism.  Some white dude shoots up a church or a temple or an abortion clinic and all we talk about is Muslim terrorism.  Tens of thousands of Americans die to gun violence and all we talk about is Muslim terrorism.  Broken healthcare, stagnating wages, unemployment nothing but Muslim terrorism. You mean one party of the government can't stop talking about it, while the other side can't acknowledge it because for some reason they took Islam under their wing, and feel the need to compulsively defend it from any criticism.   &gt; Some white dude kills or injures almost 600 people and still all we talk about is Muslim terrorism.  ISIS claimed Stephen Paddock converted to Islam.  So even when a white dude kills or injures almost 600 people you can't get away from talking about Muslim terrorism.  &gt;Broken healthcare  I thought the ACA fixed healthcare? I have seen that claim so much but still dont see it in the news.  Several activists also tried to push the narrative that it was Islamophobia (and white people) that motivated him to kill all those innocent people. Not necessarily disagreeing with you, but which activists? &gt;but she's being charged with aiding a terror organization. So it seems he was a closet terrorist, actually.  Just because she's being charged doesn't mean its true. Just because they said it was a terrorist organization doesn't make that true, either. And just because she's charged doesn't mean the deceased is a terrorist. The number of assumptions involved here betray a real lack of critical thinking. In a country where federal agencies routinely manufacture terror plots in order to arrest literally retarded Muslims, it is insane to make any assumptions. Why not both? It can be both, I'm just saying that either the media or the government seemed to be pushing the closet homosexual thing and downplaying the terrorist theory.  Because only one is true (terrorism) I feel bad saying it, but what exactly did she do again? I totally forgot with all the other terrible events in the news... didnt report to anyone that he had been planning a mass shooting of gays for years Is it really planning when you talk about killing people for years without taking any steps to go through with it?  I just want to be sure I'm not going to be arrested as an accomplice if my coworker kills his wife like he has been swearing he was going to for years now.   I mean, jokes aside, I wonder what evidence they have that she should have known he was serious rather than just shooting his mouth off. It's not just that she heard him talk about it. From what I've read, she drove him to many gun stores where he bought guns (one source that she fronted the money or even bought a gun in her name, seems only alleged), and even drove him to Pulse nightclub itself several times during the day to scope it out.   It's not like he was telling her, "I want to kill gay people" over and over again. She was privy to aspects of his plan, his methods, and his actionable intention to murder gay people at the nightclub.  Thanks, that's exactly the sort of info I wanted. She also drove him to Disney World.  Where they BOTH scoped the place out for a terror attack.  Where Disney security spotted them, and reported them to the FBI because Disney could see they were scoping the place for a terror attack.  Where the FBI did nothing. source? I never knew about that!  I really don’t have much faith in the FBI these days.  &gt; Is it really planning when you talk about killing people for years without taking any steps to go through with it? &gt;   She drove him by the gay clubs to case the place. [removed] Yeah you're gonna be on some list now.... Oh well. Maybe they can trace my activity and an NSA agent will find himself liking r/prequelmemes as much as the rest of us  They'll find out about the droid attack on the wookies. Get them away from the sub. Its a sub we cant afford to lose.... I know this is the meme, but, *it's so very true...* So it’s treason then Please, who do you think is responsible for all of the reposts? I mean, sometimes when I'm stuck in traffic I pretend I'm Goku and pretend to Ki Blast every fucking car around me.  If that's wrong I don't want to be right.  You're now on a list. A list of weebs. jokes on ya’ll i’ve been on that list Its the only way we can throw suspicion off ourselves Not on paper just as an intellectual exercise /s As far as I know, they think she knew of her husbands plans and chose to do nothing.  They think she is complicit.  I believe she did some interviews which did not do very well to shed those beliefs people have about her involvement.  If I recall, very unapologetic. Pretty sure she bought ammo for or with him and knew his plans. And did scouting of places with him. Pretty sure she drove him there but not 100% on the last part.  I thought her defense was that she had learning disabilities so could be very easily manipulated by her husband and that her marriage was arranged through her father... who already knew he was a violent man based on the husband's previous failed marriage. Huh never heard that. But from what I read she knew he was going to do it/something. All it takes is a 911 call from her and 49 lives are saved. Fuck her.  Her old teacher basically described her as boarderline retarded. https://www.mediaite.com/online/abc-news-reports-that-orlando-shooters-wife-has-learning-disabilities/ Well, learning disabilities and/or mental retardation need to be diagnosed by a medical professional. A teacher's opinion is not a medical diagnosis. Getting bad grades is not a medical diagnosis. Etc.  If she received such a diagnosis before the shooting, she might be able to use that in her defense. If she received one after it, the jury may not be swayed by it since anyone could deliberately performing poorly on IQ tests to "prove" they're retarded when their freedom is on the line.  If she's found guilty, lock her up and throw away the key. Florida has some pretty unpleasant prisons and keeping the AC running isn't at the top of their priorities. There's gonna be a *lot* of humid summers for this bitch before she kicks the bucket! According to your source she had difficulty "learning". In fact what they describe is maybe a form of ADHD or Dyslexia. She was in "classes" but not in a special school. If you hear her talk she isn't "retarded". They're trying to play it up, like insanity. She had a driver's license and was left at home to take care of the house.     Stupid people get charged and convicted of crimes all the time.  In fact, I would argue that most prison inmates in general have significantly lower IQs than the general population.  As I understand it, she would have to be seriously retarded to the point of not understanding the charges against her and being unable to assist in her defense.  From what we know, she doesn't seem to have that level of impairment. I remember this too. I wish it was expanded on more because there is a huge difference between her being complicit to this while having a learning disability like dyslexia and her being complicit with some form of mental retardation. I believe she actually helped him scout locations, including Disney world.  The exact wording she used was "cased" in reference to DW. She went on dry runs with him as well.  She dropped him off at Pulse the night of the attack. They have evidence to show that she is complicit. Including her story changing, her being privy to his planning. Helping him plan. Scope places out and even buy weapons doing it.  The only thing that really suggest otherwise, that we know, is that she says she didn't really know.   Well if being complicit is wanting to be a force for good and to make a positive impact...  Good.  She went on dry runs with him.  She knew.  His whole family knew. This isn’t the 1800s where news can stay localized.  The whole world saw the news about her husband, so the trial location is largely irrelevant.  If there is justice, she will never get to breathe free air again If there is justice she will be forced to breathe farts instead of free air forever The transition in the change of tone was flawless As an LGBT person living in Orlando.....  Part of me hopes she rots in a cell.  The other part of me hopes she rots in a cell, but the twist is it's a slightly darker cell! Her defense is simple:  “Dear juries:  my husband found a gun wrapped in clothes, he was trying to shoot a seal and it went off...”   "It wouldn't stop shooting." "Seals everywhere!" Ah yes, the *Zarate defense*. I bet after the recent ruling she was *really* hoping for a trial in the Bay Area I don't think a place with such a large gay community would be very sympathetic towards her. I didn’t think a place that leans so left would have let a man that killed a woman off so easily either.  Especially given they are so hostile to guns. You would think a case of gun violence like that would have resulted in book throwing at the defendant.  The only count he was convicted of was "felon in possession of a gun". What's this about? It's the Kate Steinle case.  Jose Inez Garcia Zarate found a stolen gun on a pier wrapped in a towel.  His account is inconsistent at times on whether the gun went off accidentally or if he intentionally shot it, but the bullet ricocheted, traveled 78 more feet, and hit Steinle, killing her.  The bullet traveled 200 feet in total.  The jury ruled that he was not guilty of murder or manslaughter but that he was guilty of illegally possessing a firearm because they believed that he had no intent of trying to kill anyone.  Because Zarate is an illegal immigrant, conservatives have attempted to use this case as proof that illegal immigrants kill people. "found a gun" he just wanted to shoot a few seals, leave the man alone Zarate had been deported 5 times, but was still in the US due to  "sanctuary city" San Francisco. Missing a little detail. He had been deported, meaning he actually had been sent out of the US. All of his previous crimes were for possession of drugs, and like one or two for illegal entry into the US. He re-entered, and had been arrested and served a prison sentence. Then afterwards ICE asked the SF police to detain him longer so they could come get him, but SF doesn't comply with those requests so let him go (as they would have for any other person completing their sentence).  &gt;U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had issued a detainer for Garcia Zarate requesting that he be kept in custody until immigration authorities could pick him up. However, as a sanctuary city, its “Due Process for All” ordinance restricted cooperation with ICE to cases only where the immigrant had both current violent felony charges and past violent felony convictions; therefore, San Francisco disregarded the detainer and released him. He was released from San Francisco County Jail on April 15, 2015, and had no outstanding warrants or judicial warrants, as confirmed by the San Francisco Sheriff's Department. Sure, he was missing the details, but he was right. The whole case played out like OJ. I don't know WTF the jury was thinking. This was a giant win for the GOP and people being anti-immigrant. Note, thjs guy was a POS with several deportations. I have no idea how he didn't at least get manslaughter.   I mean he was an illegal immigrant and he killed someone, haha I don't know what point you're trying to make? &gt;Jose Inez Garcia Zarate found a stolen gun on a pier wrapped in a towel.    Says the seven time felon, who was defended on the premise that he was too stupid to know better.   &gt;Jose Inez Garcia Zarate found a stolen gun on a pier wrapped in a towel.  His account is inconsistent at times on whether the gun went off accidentally or if he intentionally shot it, but the bullet ricocheted, traveled 78 more feet, and hit Steinle, killing her.  The bullet traveled 200 feet in total.  His initial statement involved "shooting at seals", this is manslaughter at the minimum.    He was in custody months before the Steinle incident. SF authorities ignored ICE's hold request and they let him walk.  Had he been a US citizen he absolutely would have been in jail.  Had SF held him for ICE he would have been deported again.   &gt;Because Zarate is an illegal immigrant, conservatives have attempted to use this case as proof that illegal immigrants kill people  Kate Steinle would be alive if it werent for this absurd legislation. It's a bit ridiculous to shrug this off as a conservative witch hunt. You were good until your last sentence, where your argument went to shit.  You don’t have to be conservative to be outraged that a city has harbored a 7 time felon and 5 time deportee who ended up killing somebody, accidentally or not, and walked away scott free. ....are you saying that an illegal immigrant didn't kill someone in this situation? That sounds fairly reasonable, except for that last line.  Thanks for the summary. That would be pretty clear cut manslaughter.  Manslaughter is when you kill someone unintentionally by acting irresponsibly. Good point. I think that comes down to whether it was a (reasonably responsible) accident or not. If I see a bundle on the ground and pick it up to see what it is, and it turns out it's a faulty gun that goes off from the movement, that's not necessarily irresponsible on my part. Not to say that's what happened here, but just as an example. Prosecutor was a fucktard. Except he was a seven time felon, and previously deported five times. The city of San Francisco's Sanctuary laws were the only thing keeping him from being deported again.   This was at the SF Pier and his initial excuse was that he was trying to shoot Seals from the pier.   What other country can you commit seven felonies, illegally enter six times, kill someone with an illegal weapon, and get a free ride home after a few months in jail?  Depending on the development of that country you would be in jail for a long time or dead. Shhhhhh enough with your logic, clearly the only outrage here is from conservatives trying to prove dreamers are violent /s If it was a white guy then yeah, sure, the book would have been thrown at him.  But it was a brown man who was in the United States illegally, which for some odd reason really tickles some chords for them.  It's a strange time, 2017. &gt; If it was a white guy then yeah, sure, the book would have been thrown at him.  What, like being charged with murder, you mean, and tried before a jury? You'd have thought the prosecution would be even the slightest bit competent. It's almost as if the jury looked at the evidences and decided there was reasonable doubt that he intended to kill. Except he was being tried for manslaughter... intent doesn’t matter  people driving vehicles that kill people are given manslaughter even though they didn’t mean to. This. There is not enough trust given to the people who actually sit through the trial, see all the evidence and deliberate before reaching a verdict. They are *probably* in a better position than a random Redditor to reach a  verdict.  lol you people are so full of shit  intent doesn’t matter in manslaughter, which he was charged with. That’s right. We don’t trust them at all. It’s common knowledge that prosecutors are highly skilled at only getting conformist dummies on juries. Why on earth would we trust them? Again I don't know and neither do you what facts the jury got for sure or the instructions from the judge.  It seems like it might be a prosecutor error in how they tried it.  It's awful being on a jury. Witnesses and evidence shows that the bullet was not directed at her but ricocheted off stuff and then struck her. He didn't intend to murder her. He behaved in a dangerous and negligent manner. He deserved involuntary manslaughter. Which the prosecution screwed up by using brandishing for the involuntary manslaughter charge rather than illegal possession of a weapon. The prosecution blew the case, and the Jury followed the law.  https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/12/06/kate-steinle-murder-trial-jury-didnt-botch-216016 I’m in no way okay with what happened.  I know, buddy. Sorry if it looks like I was implying you were. Agreed. The crux is they somehow managed to convince at least one juror that it was possible that he didn't know the thing he picked up was a gun since it was wrapped in a towel. The whole trial was ridiculous about that though. They even had an expert witness lie to the court that the gun he fired wasn't drop-safe, when in reality the model of Sig he shot her with has no recorded instances of drop-firing in an extensive service history. It's possible that they were referring to the California-specific "handgun roster" which lists specific models that have been drop tested to the *state's* satisfaction. Handguns not on that roster cannot legally be sold by FFL dealers here.  While the P239 in .40 S&amp;W is on the list, this particular one was stolen from a BLM vehicle, so it might have been a make/model that's not on the roster, since government agencies can issue weapons not on the list.  Of course, it's obvious the entire purpose was to mislead the jury, since the differences between the DAK version of the pistol and the DAO and DA/SA versions don't alter the firearm's drop safety characteristics... Just want to offer a correction.  It was more than one juror since he was found not guilty.  I listened to Mark O Mara's comments, on Smerconish, and he made a pretty good argument for the verdict. Isn't that how your legal system is supposed to work ... PROVEN guilty and all that... Which ruling? Why is that? Kate Steinle Yeah, but how is it relevant to this? Someone that is clearly guilty can get off free in that area. Widow drove husband to the nightclub, seems clear she knew what he was about to do. I think you killed the hamster powering his brain. Kate’s Wall.  As a resident of Orlando, good. Too many people pushing narratives getting in the way of justice [deleted] Yes, it seems strange to hold anyone around a criminal accountable for the criminal's actions.  If she truly conspired with him then she should be held accountable.  If he was just using her resources to become a, "gun enthusiast," or further advance his Muslim faith, I don't know.  Spouses can weave some pretty wicked nets of deception.  I don't know if she was a victim of the deception, or if she has the blood of those victims on her hands as much as he does.  The trial will hopefully expose it. I thought you just didn't have to testify against your spouse.  I'm not sure about not reporting stuff like that beforehand.  What I wonder if how you can possibly prove what someone did or did not know.  Are there texts or emails or anything written down? I don't think spousal testimonial privilege extends to not reporting that they intend to commit a crime. If it can be shown that she was aware of his intention it could be criminal negligence or something. Here the only privilege she has as his spouse would be that she cannot be compelled to testify against him.  Idk!  Hopefully the trial brings to light some of this. I THINK she is being accused of buying him ammo and driving him to it, among other things? I'm not sure and am having some trouble getting exactly what's going on here. &gt; Wasn't she prohibited from disclosing based on Title VII 90.504  The statute does not prohibit anyone from telling the police about an imminent crime, it is for courts only and would not apply in a case where they are both accused. Poor little kid caught in the middle. :( I read this as Pulse shooter's Window and was very confused. She came out as gay so its all good!  Finally, what a sigh of relief
 Well they weren’t going to use them. Personally I’m tired of dead people taking the good parking  You don't know that!  Unlives matter!  Check your un-undead privilege!   Undead Yes  Unperson No Alright, calm down Reg :) SO, off-topic, but he definitely has the best death scene in the entire series, yeah? r/unexpecteddiscworld :P We prefer “mortally challenged”, thank you. Case closed &gt;The sheriff's office says Bradley was videotaped parking in the disabled spot recently, and that a search of her home led to the discovery of permits issued to two people who have died.  So this was serious enough to get a warrant for her home? It seems more like a witch hunt to me.   "Go ahead and search my home! You won't find anything!" -- Something somebody dumb enough to park in front of city hall with dead people's parking permits might say. If someone is caught breaking the law, it's a witch hunt?  Not at all. What I am suggesting is that the mayor pissed someone off, and that someone went out of their way to find dirt on her. If she did steal those placards I hope they strip her of office and toss her in jail. But I hope this isn't some sort of setup, because it looks like one.  Quite possible... I'm from that area, so when I saw the headline, I was thinking "please don't let it be Polk County".... But, of course it was!  How is it a witch hunt if they have video evidence of her breaking the law? A witch hunt does not indicate persecution of an innocent person, it is undue persecution. It sounds like the sheriff got mad at her so he had her followed, trying to find something they could charge her with. &gt; It sounds like the sheriff got mad at her so he had her followed, trying to find something they could charge her with.  That's plausible, but it's equally plausible that the police are just doing their jobs. I would want to see some evidence before jumping to that line of thinking.  She's been charged with multiple felonies. Call me crazy, but searching her home for evidence seems reasonable. I don't see why someone would look at that and jump to "the sheriff is out to get her".     Okay, now for the really pedantic part.  &gt; A witch hunt does not indicate persecution of an innocent person, it is undue persecution.  I don't think that's true. Definitions of the term vary, but I haven't found one yet that would cover this situation.  For reference:  [Wiktionary:](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/witch-hunt)  &gt; (2) An attempt to find and publicly punish a group of people perceived as a threat, usually on ideological or political grounds. &gt; (3) A public smear-campaign against an individual.  (note: a "smear" is, [by definition](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/smear), false)  [dictionary.com:](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/witch-hunt)  &gt; an intensive effort to discover and expose disloyalty, subversion, dishonesty, or the like, usually based on slight, doubtful, or irrelevant evidence.  [Merriam-Webster:](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/witch%20hunt)  &gt; the searching out and deliberate harassment of those (such as political opponents) with unpopular views.  [Cambridge English Dictionary:](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/witch-hunt)  &gt; an attempt to find and punish people whose opinions are unpopular and who are said to be a danger to society  [Oxford Living Dictionary:](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/witch-hunt)  &gt; A campaign directed against a person or group holding unorthodox or unpopular views. So looking at those definitions, do you see how innocence is not presumed or even suggested? I'll meet you halfway, then. Innocence isn't *necessarily* presumed, but it is heavily implied.  In a witch-hunt, legal and harmless behavior is misinterpreted as evidence of a crime. It's perfectly possible that bad evidence and bad assumptions can lead to a correct conclusion; it's just unlikely. The negative connotation of the term *comes* from the fact that witch-hunts almost always turn out to be baseless.  There's a subtle distinction here that I want to go back to. You said this:  &gt; A witch hunt does not indicate persecution of an innocent person, it is *undue* persecution.  That's true in one sense: a witch-hunt is undue because it's based on faulty evidence and/or assumptions. It *doesn't* apply to someone who is unduly punished for a crime they actually committed. &gt;That's true in one sense: a witch-hunt is undue because it's based on faulty evidence and/or assumptions. It *doesn't* apply to someone who is unduly punished for a crime they actually committed.  Awesome. So now will you agree with me on other points as well?  1: Innocent until proven guilty  2: Police officers have been known to fabricate and plant evidence  3: Political opponents have been known to use similar tactics to remove someone from office  4: The video evidence indicates  surveillance, the reason for which was not given in the article   1. She'll have her day in court.  2. Does that invalidate all evidence?  3. What, catching them in the act of committing a crime?  4. No it doesn't.  First of all, the article doesn't say who took the video. It could have been the police, or a handicapped person who was pissed off that she was taking a parking space, or some other random person.  Second, I would expect there to be a pretty significant police presence at City Hall. If they saw someone breaking the law, it would make sense to record them for evidence, particularly if that person is a prominent politician in the town.  Third, even if they *were* watching her, you're basically pulling an explanation out of your ass as to why. If she was breaking the law on a regular basis, what other motivation does there need to be?  Seems like the cops are damned if they do, damned if they don't. If they don't go after law-breaking politicians, they're corrupt. If they do, they're trying to manipulate the democratic process. I see ~~dead people~~ what you did there. Wouldn't the mayor already have a dedicated parking spot?  They changed the laws in Florida several years back to require actual medical necessity for disabled parking permits (To combat fraud). Before the laws changed it was a form at the DMV and whatever the permit fee was. That doesn’t stop the fraud. Loads of people use it when they aren’t disabled. Last week alone I saw someone park in a spot (with the placard) and literally run in the store because it was raining.  I found it funny ...but I’m sure someone who really needed the spot didn’t. I tend to park wherever I see a spot to get an extra few steps in my life for health reasons.   &gt;Last week alone I saw someone park in a spot (with the placard) and literally run in the store because it was raining  Doesn't mean they aren't legit. Believe me, I've seen the threads with people explaining just what's wrong with them even though they don't seem sick.  Also doesn't mean that it couldn't have been fake. The piece of gutter trash that lived with his elderly mom across the street from me used her parking permit for over a year while she was out of the house getting medical care. (I'm happy to say that despite working out at the gym every day he died before 50. I've just assumed the many years of drug abuse killed him or maybe he caught something from those hookers he used to bring home.)   So it does happen. I just no longer judge unless I'm sure of the facts of the situation. And with a stranger, I'm not sure. Just because you see someone run doesn't mean they are not handicapped. He needs more parking spots, in front stores, other businesses. &gt; The mayor of a small Florida city has been arrested on allegations that she used dead people's disabled parking permits to park at City Hall.  Yeah but at City hall doesn't make sense Seriously, I'd assume the mayor would have their own spot. And it's a small town, parking can't be that bad. You would think so, but they don't  The GPW of 1776.. The mayor's spot is 15 feet further than the handicapped spot. Busy officials need to prioritize their valuable time. People are lazy like that especially ones who need the extra calorie burning in their lives.  I like the people who drive around the parking lot for 10 mins trying to find a close spot. When they get out of the car you can clearly see why they want said spot.  Aren't disabled spots usually bigger than the rest, and positioned as close to the entrance as possible? Normally one or two have the van loading extra space, not all of them though. And dedicated parking spaces are pretty close as well. Depends on location Fair enough. I don't think that conflicts with my hypothesis, though. Hearse was parked in it Why? I can understand corruption for a billion dollars. It's still corruption but I can see how that could be tempting. But something as petty as parking permits? Do public officials have such contempt for the people and decency? How do people like this get to be mayors?  Have you ever seen what some people do with basic moderation powers on an internet forum? Some people abuse even the tiniest amount of power. You are now a moderator of r/politics  You are now a moderator of /r/pyongyang. Hell, one of the mods in r_AWWW told me they'll ban anyone they want to over any reason they want to. It doesn't have anything do with breaking the rules.  How pathetic that person's life must be that that's what they cling to to make them feel important. [deleted] Like you? &gt; How do people like this get to be mayors?  By cheating - it's how you win. That's why they teach us that it's wrong - so we don't win. How do people like this get to be mayor? Seriously? This is the US here the capital of the country Washington D.C. had a mayor who was elected AFTER he has done time for smoking crack with a prostitute lol  Edit to biggly the word after Bitch set him up! she was bored Polk County is the Appalachians of Florida. A lot of wretchedly poor hillbillies there.  &gt;Why? I can understand corruption for a billion dollars. It's still corruption but I can see how that could be tempting. But something as petty as parking permits? Do public officials have such contempt for the people and decency? How do people like this get to be mayors?   People ruin their careers over small things because they don't think they'll be caught.  We had a school principal who was doing some kind of scam over high school football tickets. It netted him a few hundred dollars, a firing and probably made his unemployable in the field.   I rarely support MORE perks for politicians, but they should definitely get the best parking spot. Is something wrong with their legs? You don't think handicapped people deserve the best spots..? Fuck politicians. Bunch of snakes! No they deserve some sadly some places give them ALL the best spots. I'm looking at you krogers 9 billion handicap spots rarely have I seen a fraction of them filled. And Davenport only has a couple thousand people. It's just a power trip. Wow, this mayor's cops must hate her or something. Sheriff is a county-wide elected official. A mayor of a small city within the county ain't shit to him. Follow this, mark my words I wouldn't be surprised if the city's cops don't like her also, or accusations are made that the sheriff is cozy with someone who wants to run for mayor of that city.  Every time I open an article about Florida doing something fucked up I always pray it isn’t Polk County. And when I see it is, I pray it isn’t Lakeland. Luckily, today is was good ol’ shitty Davenport Me too but just so I don't have to see Sheriff Judd grandstanding for the thousandth time!  Oh my god that man has so many people so far up his ass it’s ridiculous... when I saw him all over the news during Irma I nearly had a damn stroke At least you're not Vegas.  Having to see our shitty sheriff all over the news through October was awful.   Oooh but you KNOW that I as a regular citizen would be charged with way more if I was caught using dead peoples parking permits.  I mean, "charged with multiple felonies", sounds pretty bad. True that. I'm coming to realise that I'm the kinda guy that serves as a reminder that the internet is a "take it with grain of salt" kinda place. Is this sarcasm? I don't know anymore &gt;Oooh but you KNOW that I as a regular citizen would be charged with way more if I was caught using dead peoples parking permits.   No, you'd probably just get a ticket.  They normally don't serve search warrants for parking offenses. So FLorida Mayor leads the town where Florida Man and Florida Woman live right? Must be nice living around so many celebrities!  This mayor must have pissed someone off. As far as I know this is standard municipality practice. It's not the first time I've heard of this trick but usually it's a rumor or just someone running their mouth. Never heard of it actually being looked into.  Florida Woman strikes again!  Edit: Thank you Rising. Florida **woman** The Mayor  doesn't automatically get a decent parking spot at City Hall?  Handicapped parking spaces are usually bigger than normal ones, and as close as possible to the entrance. Shitty behavior but not really worth an arrest and felony charge, maybe just a large fine followed by subsequent public shaming.  A felony should involve actual harm done to people, not just finding a sneaky way to park closer to your work.  I mean you  might as well start arresting everyone who borrows a relative's placard to go to the mall, or takes a shit in the handicapped stall in a public bathroom because its roomier. There's shitty behavior that doesn't rise to the level of serious criminality, this is one of those cases where a fine is enough.    Yes, people who borrow a placard in the manner you suggest should be arrested. The ones harmed are handicapped individuals, who the space is reserved for. Also, missing your power as an elected official is frowned upon. This lady messed up. Welcome to Polk County. Good ole Grady Judd using them tax dollars to maximum effect. The handicapped stall isn't reserved, but I do feel like people should be arrested for parking in not only handicapped parking, but no parking emergency lanes. Seriously though... they park on tip of a giant painted no parking, with another one in front of them, and a sign on the pillar next to them. But they can't be bothered to park to buy their smoothie... &gt; takes a shit in the handicapped stall in a public bathroom because its roomier.  There's nothing illegal about that.  Just like you can use the family restrooms even though you don't have family with you.   Florida man got elected? Florida, where you drive North to go South. This story is so Miami The Parking Dead?  Only, no Daryl. Who cares? That's a hilarious mayor move. Unless he was raping everyone it's just not going to make news, these days. This sucks, because if this is actually true, it's more ammunition to push and pedal the myth that elections are corrupt because they are using the names of "dead voters", which is overwhelmingly fucking bullshit Casey Anthony George Zimmerman the beans ... Florida is full of walking talking shit stained roaches that are corrupt from top to bottom. It's this bad everywhere. Florida just has laws giving the press free, open, nearly-instantaneous access to police data. Crazy shit is happening all over, you just don't hear about it nearly as much. I'm aware sadly sheriff Joe served over 20 years in my home county . Just to illustrate he allowed 400+ sex crimes to go uninvestigated . Not only that though we know he likes to start witch hunts, to distract from his own departments failures. So he did shit for publicity to make him seem hard on crime when he was letting the real criminals free. A righteous person doesn't continually get sued and lose. She's a person with power and money, so nothing will be done about it.  Edit - words. She, not he She's a mayor of a small town in central Florida. I doubt she's seriously connected or is loaded with cash
 Another case of someone projecting their judgements and views onto others when they have no idea what the person on the receiving end is going through. Wasn't a sheriff caught recently using dead people's handicap stickers?  I believe that when violations are committed by people in power flagrantly and often, then the crazies in society see themselves as vigilantes and try to police everyone (or alternatively, crazies are committing the violations themselves because they perceive that people in power do it without punishment) Call-out culture and public shaming is one of the worst things in existence right now. Another example of assuming first and questioning those assumptions never.  A real shame.   someone using virtue signaling as a cover for envy? I've gotten called out for bringing in riding carts from the lot at Walmart.  People just want to be mad.  People are so shitty. Call-out culture and generation offended are the biggest hypocrites in the past 200 years.  Be careful of singling out specific generations or their call-out culture if you don't want to hear about the nasty self-righteous shit your own generation did.   I'm technically a millennial myself and I can't stand people in my own generation with their virtue signalling and hypocritical facebook activism. People in my generation don't really self reflect, introspect or think critically about their surroundings.  Same here. Nothing worse than the self-congratulatory post when a vapid snowflake doesn't support something and *just wants you to know* that they oppose it on social media.   "I just wanted to take a moment to thank everybody who stands with me in opposing[*insert politician or issue here*]. It's vile that we are subjected to a society where [*stupid issue*] is afflicted upon citizens. Perhaps one day we will move past it, but I just do not see how! #[*stupid fucking slogan*]"  The passive aggressive pearl clutching has reached a fever pitch, and I am beginning to endorse the idea of trying to start a satirical movement to finding the world's *least* privileged person so that whenever a decision on *any* level must be made, we can just go to that person to get their input first, to avoid any potential insensitivity or offense.   Sad part is I'm pretty sure that this movement would take off. GoFundMe here I come! /s Never have I witness such abject human indecency as when I have to park at KOP around Christmas.  Makes me sick. I'm a not viability disabled person and I always am a little afraid people will question or shame me for parking where I need to.  People like this are part of what makes people ashamed and afraid to use the resources provided for those in need.  There is a freaking handicap tag in the car. What a jackass.
 no shit....  I, for one, am **shocked** that there's more than one of these creeps enjoying all the benefits of Western society, while actively trying to dismantle all that it stands for.  /s At this point, you sort of have to put most of the blame on [the people letting them into the country.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DPwknc2W4AErtAJ.jpg)  Like seriously, can you imagine it? You're born in some pretty awful country that routinely is engulfed in civil war, has abysmal healthcare, public stonings, the whole package. You're then made an offer by politicians in by far the most developed societies in human history: If you come to their country and vote for them, they'll give you government handouts, they'll pass laws to prevent people from criticizing you or your religion, their media and universities will constantly churn out propaganda about how not having sex with you is bigotry, and there's absolutely no catch. They'll pay for your children, they won't make you learn their language, if you commit a crime then you'll get a reduced sentence or even have it covered up by the police, they'll let you live in your own little migrant conclave which is just like home except with first world luxuries. They'll even push forward a cultural shift so you're considered as valid a Briton as someone who's lived there for your entire life and has ancestry there spanning back hundreds of years.   Why, you don't even have to work, although they very much appreciate it when immigrants serve as scabs for citizens of the country who demand increases to their abysmal wages. That's why you see so many Republican politicians softening up on even illegal immigration. Corporations from Disney to Tyson to Monsanto *love* open borders.   The majority of us would take them up on that. That's an awesome deal.  So my friend immigrated to the UK from Egypt to work as a GP, which we desperately need. Her English is perfect and although she’s Muslim she is downright progressive in her politics, as many young Egyptians are.  The hoops she has been made to jump through by the home office are appalling; the amount of money she has spent, and the pain she has suffered trying to secure a visa for her 3 year old daughter is appalling.   You’re narrative that  are somehow welcoming to immigrants is so detached from reality, I can’t even fathom how you’ve come to it.  Where are you getting this shit pumped into you?   I think they were talking about refugee's not immigrants. There's a big difference, open  your eyes.  She should've throw out her passport and claimed refugee status. The fact Islamic state terrorists are able to return and there are calls for ignoring/forgiving their joining a foreigh terrorist movement responsible for wsging wsr against the UK, and committing ethnic cleansing, slavery and carrying out all multitudes of terrorism responsible for the deaths of 10s of 1000s. Yeah your example of your one friend is really convincing.  I really don't think a lot of people on the pro-immigration side understand that their (almost always female, Al-amira hijab wearing) second-generation Muslim friend whose (Lebanese, Iranian, Egyptian) parents that are/were wealthy (lawyers, doctors, scientists) and who attends university to follow in their footsteps or to get a gender studies/sociology degree while praying once every couple of days at home and maybe paying a few visits to a progressive tri-faith congregation on Islam's holiest days is absolutely not anywhere close to being the average MENA immigrant to a western country.  Muslims are not progressive. Why the fuck does the U.K. need to be like America?  Are you fucking insane?  Welcoming to modern Bongistan. These guys are all just chilling in Manchester, God they are fucked Britain is fucked.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FU7WV2Itrtc people don't question their ideology because it is now 'Islamophobic' to do so, so this shit has breeding ground, and we will refuse to eradicate it.  You want a far right uprising all over Europe? This is how you get a far right uprising all over Europe.  p.s. killing your enemy makes you win, not them mr Tradueashit
 Your eyes say 14, but your hairline says 40 Yoo, that dude at least 40 That 40 year old man is 14? Detroit... what a town.  Yeah things have gotten pretty dark there as of late.  Technically this was in Warren. It's technically a suburb of Detroit. Its southern edge borders Detroit on 8 Mile Road. For decades, it was a blue-collar city full of auto factory workers. These days, it's basically "North Detroit". I lived there for many years, including during its rapid decline. Homes were foreclosed and later purchased as rental properties. It went from hard-working people and their families, to Section 8 ghetto in a period of a few years. Everything between 8 Mile and 11 Mile is a festering hell-hole, and I now have the same feelings of anxiety driving through that city as I do in Detroit or Flint. Eastpointe here, lived there from birth til 14. Moved out to the Mt Clemens area in 2004.  It used to be such a nice town, as far as child-me could tell anyway. On return trips to the area, it's basically done nothing but decay over the past decade-plus-change. Old mainstays of the town have gone as well, namely Pete &amp; Frank's fruit market. Holy hell, I haven't thought of Pete &amp; Franks since the 80s. That's some nostalgia right there. I lived in Eastpointe... well, East Detroit, from 80-85. I have relatives there now, and I wouldn't visit without a gun. Actually, same goes for Mt. Clemens I guess. I lived there for a few years also. I lived in the trailer park next to The Traffic Light... which of course isn't exactly a nice part of town. Mt. Clemens is weird though. From one block to the next you have ghetto/nice/white trash/nice and so forth.      But yea, Eastpointe and Warren are both places I'd rather not ever go again. I'll throw Roseville in there too for good measure. You get anxiety driving through Flint? Why? Most of the roads are wide and well lit (dort, saginaw, ballenger, atherton, miller, center, ect are all 4 lanes for most areas). I rarely see loiterers anymore. I mean yeah, it's poor and all, but I'm not sure it is as bad as people try to make it out to be. There is a lot of blight that is slowly being bought and renovated. Most violence in Flint nowadays seems to be violence against people who know each other. Detroit is essentially a third world country.  We need to build walls around the city so they don't spread. Or try to come up with solutions to improve the area? Detroit is part of america. There actually has been a huge push to help Detroit. I just finished a paper on how the government has been supporting the Detroit Land Bank Authority to mitigate some of the decay across the neighborhoods. And Dan Gilbert’s been investing a lot into the city to help it economically.  I feel, having watched the local ABC affiliate station basically roll around in "Detroit's on a comeback" for the past handful of years, that they're focusing a lot on the city center, while the outlying areas continue to decay.  Did you touch on that at all? Is it accurate? The state has been trying to gentrify Detroit for the last few years.  There have been a few hipster communities that have popped up over the years but the city is still rotten to its core.   You're looking at a city with an estimated 14 to 20 billion in debt and a long list of indicted city officials ranging from school principles to mayors. The only way you're going to fix Detroit is by purging the entire system Yes and no. It's kinda due to the different natures of the work being done in each area. So what you're talking about in the city center is a lot of the stuff being done by people like Gilbert through his companies, Rock Ventures and Quicken Loans. They're big improvements, but they're also quick to implement relatively speaking.   There's actually quite a bit going on with the neighborhoods through the land bank and the blight removal task force. The difference is that the land bank process is inherently slow compared to some of the stuff going on in the city center. They have to first identify and acquire blighted properties, then they either put them up for sale to renovator-owners or slate them for demolition. Selling them is a waiting game for buyers to show up and even then, if they don't meet the requirements of the deed-in-escrow renovation contract they sell them under, the land bank winds up with the property again. In terms of demolition, they've actually at one point demolished so many homes per week that they've reached a diseconomy of scale due the demolitions costs rising. Pretty sure at one point the price of backfill materials skyrocketed due to the land banks demolition work.   Now compare that Quicken loans moving it's offices to a building downtown, or even the city building the Q-Line and those seem much quicker and impressive gains for the city. Not to mention the land bank has to go through this process for like 85 thousand properties so the process seems much slower.  Edit: Forgot to mention that one of the programs Gilbert's people are running is literally a re-branding campaign that's trying to sell Detroit as a growing tech hub called Opportunity Detroit. That may have something to do with the focus on the city center. I honestly am starting to think the only thing that will work would be national guardsmen on every corner for two years and an Iraq style nation building program.  Of course, that's not going to happen for a million reasons, most of which I'd probably agree with, but I think it's so fucked I don't know what else would do it. We should put some democrats in charge for fifty years straight This happened in Warren... a suburb of the city not even in the same county as Detroit. Also a historically white area. Why don't you get up from your computer and see what Detroit is like for yourself. Have you been to Warren in the past 15 years? Particularly South Warren? If you took away the signs, you'd never know when you left Detroit and entered Warren. "Historically white" has nothing to do with anything in 2017 Warren. "Sweden is a hellhole full of rapists"  Same people argue this shit about anywhere they think is "too liberal" without ever being outside their home town. Historically white until ruined by mutants like this Hurrr durrr detroyt iz bad cuz newz says so.  If someone posted, "New York... what a town." would you automatically jump to assuming they want it destroyed?  That's not the comment I replied to. Oh shit, you're right. I dunno how I missed Yo mama's dildo I don't know either. According to everyone on Xbox its pretty massive.  That 14 year old has a mustache that lots of young men would envy.  Hope he’s tried as an adult.  That's what the article you didn't read says. There is only one punishment fit for rape. Is it rape? There are only two punishments fit for rape... I think everyone would take being raped over being executed or hell even over a year in jail.  Death is what it should be stuff like this is why white flight exists Most rape tends to be committed by chubby white southern and midwestern guys, they just have a daddy who’s buddies with the sheriff.   But yeah I admit black community has some cultural problems with toxic masculinity. Are you still living in the 50s?  Guess he wasn't on the schools football team. I think you meant basketball and the Ball family Hope they turn out his corn hole I wonder when people express things like this--does the thought of someone you feel "deserves to be raped" being raped give you a sense of sexual excitement?  --is it more about feeling a sense of power for your superior ability to control your parallel impulses?   --or is it a sense of catharsis at the idea of a karmic justice being meted out upon a being who represents a darker shade within you taken form externally and made to suffer for being a manifested demonstration of the part of yourself you wish you could deny?  If he raped my 14 year old daughter? Yes. I would want him violated and ruined for what he did. I would want him to suffer for the rest of his life.   We were all 14. Did I ever think about raping someone? No. He is an animal that deserves the worst kind of punishment. There is no rehabilitation.    So you have never thought about raping someone but you are thinking about having a desire for someone to be raped by a proxy?  Also, to be clear--it wasn't your daughter, right?--so the whole if it was your daughter thing seems out of left field... if you were trying to say "that's somebody's daughter!" Well yes, and the perp in this case is somebody's son. And them getting raped doesn't unrape anybody. The prison rapist having a cheering squad doesn't punish the prison rapist for the crimes that put them in a position to be instruments of perverted rape justice for the sake of rape boners.   There is a logical disconnect and people are failing to recognize that while yes some justice is called for, the instinctive impulse for justice in certain shapes is poorly thought out at best People who rape people can’t really be helped. They will just do it again later. It’s a faulty wire in the brain. Can’t fix it.  This is a very basic human emotion to want to take action against an injustice. No need to complicate it or pretend you've never felt that way. It served a purpose when we were animals without a justice system but now we're left with the same feelings and a better idea of how to deal with criminals (but not quite there yet). &gt; This is a very basic human emotion   &gt; No need to complicate it or pretend you've never felt that way. It served a purpose when we were animals without a justice system but now we're left with the same feelings    You mean like  .....a desire to rape? A desire to mate is innate. It would be a good idea to control that if no one told you. Am I following if I interpret your sentiment to be that it would have been a good idea for the rapist from this story to control his desires, but it for some reason wouldn't be a good idea for the other user to control a desire for the rapist to be raped, nor for that user to even attempt to control urges leading them to express such a desire?   &gt; catharsis at the idea of a karmic justice...  Blah blah blah. People want to see bad things happen to bad people. Welcome to Earth.  Indeed, yet "bad" is subjective, and so those seen as bad people may see those they harmed as bad people...the type of bad people people want to see bad things happen to.. so they do those bad things to people they see as bad, making them bad... which begs the question of what that means about people who'd want to see bad things happen to people they believe to be bad... His FB is still up. And he has a little sister! He's got such an old look.  Is this kid born evil or a result of his environment?   Hard to say with the information from the article. Could be one or the other or both. [deleted] No. Just stop. Says the cretin who still thinks President Obama was born in Kenya.  14 and charged as an adult, that must just be for black kids.  How old was that white kid who raped three girls and did what a month in juvie. I think he is charged as an adult because not only did he rape her, he beat the shit out of her for over 30mins. Hes also getting false imprisonment which is never a good thing. Did you read the article?  article says 20 minutes, did you read the article? I hope for much worse for this 14 year old [removed] Someone as worthless as you would defend a rapist [deleted] &gt; I will wait for all the facts before I support either the accused or the accuser.  From the article:   &gt;Police said there are 50 video security cameras inside the school, and more than one recorded the attack.  Since it was described as the "most vicious case I've seen" by the police commissioner and she fought him off for 20 minutes, chances are they have plenty of proof she's not lying.  and here I thought headlines were sufficient for all the information /s There were cameras all over the school where they saw the accused fighting off the accuser before it happened... unless you're also waiting for the footage to be released before you got all the facts... and even if that happened you'll probably want to know whether the footage was doctored before you got all the facts... and even then you still won't have all the facts.  In fact, you will never have all the facts in any of these cases unless you were right there in person witnessing it.
 &gt; The bill, pre-filed Thursday by Sen. Stephen Meredith of Leitchfield, earmarks 90 percent of those revenues to a newly created fund to reimburse the state’s Medicaid program for money spent on tobacco-related illnesses.  I can get behind that.  They'll use it for a whole host of other shit, though.  Of course they will. There will be conveniently ambiguous language strewn throughout the while thing Typical rich people. The typical thing that happens is funding from other sources is reduced by the same amount. Sounds like Kentucky Bill, that ol' rascal. Kentucky Bill, sworn enemy of Florida Man To put things in comparison by context...   * The state of New York has a tax of $4.35 a pack.  New York City adds an additional $1.50, so cigarettes in NYC have $5.85 in taxes added per pack.    * Massachusetts is $3.51 in taxes per pack.      * Rhode Island is $3.50 in taxes per pack.    * Connecticut is $3.40 in taxes per pack.    * Hawaii is $3.20 in taxes per pack.    * Washington state is $3.025 in taxes per pack.    * Minnesota is $2.90 in taxes per pack.    * Vermont is $2.75 in taxes per pack.    * New Jersey is $2.70 in taxes per pack.    * Wisconsin is is $2.52 in taxes per pack.    * Alaska, Arizona, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Washington D.C. are all $2.00 in taxes per pack.    * Kentucky is currently 39th, at $0.60 in taxes per pack (soon to be $1.60, tying it with Pennsylvania for 21st).  * The cheapest is Missouri, at $0.17 in taxes per pack.   Cheapest is Missouri? Really? What about Virginia? I live in MD but its pretty well known that VA has some of the lowest taxes on cigs since they are made there as well as still being a tobacco producing state.   According to the net the tax is $0.30... so not the cheapest but pretty close.  Kentucky has kept it low for the tobacco farming industry, I'd imagine. Now that bourbon has kind of become the state's bread and butter, I can see why they'd tighten the belt on the smokers. Is there not a tax on it already? If there is it isn't much. Can get a pack for like $5 there. There is, but it's pretty small. The tobacco industry held a lot of power here for a very long time. If they want to curb teen smoking and or tobacco use, they should legalize marijuana. That way the tobacco farmers can switch crops, still make a livelihood, and not be giving people cancer. I don't think having teens switch from smoking cigs to weed would help anything. It would lower the burden of health problems on the state. You know, a conservative fiscal move. Say what? It doesn't matter if you smoke Tabacco or pot you are still inhaling vapor produced by the burning of a carbon based material. Both do horrible damage to your lungs. Smoke is smoke and regardless of its source it is bad for you. Frequency of use is a big factor tho. People aren’t smoking a pack of joints everyday. Also marijuana can be easily consumed by methods other than smoking.  Thank you! This is the most frustrating thing to explain to people. Some think that smoking marijuana is perfectly fine because it’s not tobacco but fail to realize smoking is bad for you in general.  I'm just trying to figure out what KY will do when tax revenue from cigarettes falls. There's other uses for marijuana besides smoking it, which if KY wants to shore up their state budget, should be taken into account. The $266 million it's supposed to generate doesn't seem like enough to offset the cost of smoking related illness.  Why should it completely offset the cost of smoking related illnesses? It's not like that is completely paid for by the government. That would be called socialized medicine.  If smokers are using Medicare to cover their smoking related health issues, then government is paying for it.  Does every smoker have Medicare? Smokers are disproportionately lower income.  People on Medicade are disproportionately lower income.   There for smokers are disproportionately on government provided healthcare. But I ask again, why should this tax cover ALL of the costs of tobacco-related illnesses?  Are you asking why tax on a tobacco product should cover the costs of tobacco related illnesses?   Do you prefer that income tax covers it?  No, I am asking why it NEEDS TO COVER ***ALL*** THE COSTS. Am I speaking fucking Swahili here, or what? Because tobacco causes **ALL** of the smoking related illnesses.   People on government insurance with smoking related illnesses has to be paid for somehow.  Choice is either income tax or tobacco tax.    But the people on government insurance with smoking related illnesses do not make up **ALL** the costs of smoking related illnesses, and the lion's share falls to individuals and insurance companies. Just like you don't pay for the cost of all auto-related deaths, injuries, and property damage in the tax of buying a car; auto, life, and health insurance companies and the individual do.  Guess we should start taxing junk food for all the strain obeisity related illness has on the healthcare system too. Let's start taxing needles also for all the IV drug user related illnesses we have, oh and cars for all those car crash injuries.   I agree with taxing cigarettes, tax them until they become as expensive as they are in New Zealand ($50 a pack) and see it all transition to the black market entirely unregulated.   If the private insurance companies and Medicare want to tax smokers then let them - which I believe they do charge higher premiums anyway. It's not like you have universal healthcare where everyone's paying for each other  I'd be all for taxing the crap out of junk food and fast-food. I think the main idea of taxing cigarettes (at least in Australia and New Zealand) is to make them too expensive to eventually buy. I don't know what the deal is in America but here they tax like 5% a year and it's already breaking everyone's wallets and making them quit  I believe the point should be shifting the burden of the increased medical costs back to the people making the poor lifestyle choices. Should probably just tax the cigarette companies directly for selling such an addictive product. Most people start smoking in their early teens when their decision making is poor and they just want to experiment. By the time they're an adult they are hooked and have little choice but to continue smoking. It isn't all these peoples fault, granted they do hold some accountability definitely.   If heroin was legal would you tax heroin addicts who have no choice in quitting or would you just tax the fuck out of companies selling it to cover the costs "If smokers are using Medicare to cover their smoking related health issues, then government is paying for it." No - taxpayers are paying for it.
 Of course he did. Why wouldn't you attack a store 3000 miles away from Jerusalem.. owned by a guy (*see:Jew*) that doesn't live in Israel. Makes PERFECT sense. /s clearly not racism. Whatever it is, not racist Only “white” people can be racist or something like that... Big chance it's because of religion. You can hate Jews because of their religion.  Jews aren’t a religious group. It’s a hate crime. Yes they are. They are both an ethnicity and religious group.   Are you telling me i can't covert to Judaism?   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_to_Judaism   You can go through a process to become part of the nation, but that has nothing to do with religious beliefs. A Jew can practice any religion or no religion and will still be a full Jew. Or for taking and occupying land and ruling over muslims in Apartheid..or you could just be racist. If only that was actually what's happening. Alas, it's not. They themselves call the West bank territories. The IDF has military that goes into the West bank.  Hmmm, perhaps because Hamas stockpiles rockets, bombs, and missiles in schools and hospitals in the West Bank and Gaza. What is Israel supposed to do? Just let themselves be unjustly attacked? First you said that isn't happening now you're saying it is happening. Which is it?!? I never once said that Israel doesn’t have a military presence in the West Bank. What I said is that they haven’t taken over land and ruled over Muslims in apartheid. Israel’s military actions are purely for the self-preservation of their own people who are constantly threatened/attacked. &gt; clearly not racism. Whatever it is, not racist  If it's not blind racism then why didn't the guy attack an American store.. say a McDonalds. They do have McDonald's in Holland ..I've been there. so it would be okay if they attacked a mcdonalds as well? what world do you live in? &gt; so it would be okay if they attacked a mcdonalds ..  I didn't say that. It would make ACTUAL  sense if he attacked an American target.. considering this is all about America acknowledging Jerusalem as Israel's capital.  What does a Jewish-owned store **in Amsterdam** have to do with Jerusalem?   &gt;What does a Jewish-owned store **in Amsterdam** have to do with Jerusalem?   Are you actually no understanding the connection from the POV of the attacker?    I'll fill you in: Jews.  To these people, all of us everywhere in the entire world are legitimate targets for anything having to do with Israel.  They all have dual citizenship and send money to Israel so they are supporters of said country believed by many to be the source of all conflict in the middle east.  I'm not taking sides - just throwing a nickel in the pool of thought. &gt; They all have dual citizenship  I don’t know where you got that from, but it’s not true.  &gt; said country believed by many to be the source of all conflict in the middle east.  Anyone can believe anything. It doesn’t make it true. depends on how the attacker sees them, i guess? Maybe he thinks the store's owners supported the move, or overheard them support it.   In any case, it's fair to blame trump for any increase in violence related to the middle east. the next terroristic attack will be his fault too, for the needless provocation, because he was warned that this would happen if he calls jerusalem the capital of israel.   Heck, the next recruitment cycle of terrorists will use trump's move to get even more people to join them.  And no one will take the U.S. as an acceptable partner or overseer of peace talks.  Therefore it was a bad move any way you look at it. Is it Trump's fault really though? If it is then what's the difference between blaming Trump for the violence caused by the recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and blaming Charlottesville's  government for agitating the nazi that killed Heather Heyer by taking the confederate statue down? Can't we at least put the majority of the blame on the people that actually commit the violence? These aren't savage animals, they're human beings and every day billions of people DON'T commit vandalism or violence against people and things that they feel have wronged them.  the violence was forseeable, trump was warned, he chose to do it anyways. Therefore he is to blame for his own decision, that is causing this violence.  It's literally like this:  The world: "hey trump, don't do it! None of us recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, because it is an affront to international law and to the entire Muslim world. It's going to cause violence and pour gasoline on the middle east's fires!"  The U.S. State Department, General McMaster and other seniors with vast experience: "DOn't do it Mr. President! This will lead to violence, will kill the two state solution and will virtually remove the U.S. from any peace agreement role!"  Virtually everyone: "Don't do it! this will lead to violence and death! Don't make this decision!"  trump: "lol fuck you all!" - does it anyways  /violence increases  Morons: "duhhh trump isn't to blame guys come on!" Well to be sure there is a point to be made there, but I feel like that treats the pro-palestinian vandal here more like a wild animal rather than a human who is responsible for his own decisions.   -You can't blame the bear if one of the humans teases him with a steak and gets his buddy gets mauled in turn.  -You can't blame the Palestinian if a Western leader recognizes Jerusalem is and a fellow westerner is attacked in turn.   There is logic in your statement, though. I see it there and understand the position.  I think the dispute is due to semantics alone here: Trump is to blame for any increase in violence, but the individual acts of violence are attributable to those carrying it out.   Trump's culpability is clear in circumstances where it is shown that but-for trump's decision, the violence would not have occurred or people/property would not have been harmed.  This of course doesn't mean that illegal acts by violent actors are somehow not ascribable to the actors, of course.   A good way to look at it is to understand that trump is responsible for provoking the violence, whereas the actors are legally responsible for their own crimes.  So true. It was trump he gave this man a Genocidal hatred for the Jews./s trump was warned violence will happen if he picked jerusalem for our embassy. He did so anyways. Violence then occurs. Trump is not to blame? lol No, as a matter of fact, Trump is not to blame for the violent actions of genocidal savages. yes, as a matter of fact, trump is responsible for his decision to provoke violence and destroy any chances for peace because the consequences were easily foreseeable and the entire world warned him about these specific consequences.  As much as Trump sucks, which he really does, it was still the right move to do. Israel shouldn’t have to be delegitimized by not having their sovereignty recognized simply because a bunch of terrorists will be violent. you're saying that because you support israel's claim to the palestinian city of jerusalem. I get it. However, this is objectively bad for peace and hence objectively a terrible decision. You can spam that all you want it doesn’t make it true. it's not true because i'm saying it, it's just a logical observation. ;) The only people to blame are the ones who act out.  nah, trump is at least partly responsible. I mean, it was foreseeable that this would happen, AND trump was warned against making that decision from the WORLD OVER... he can't escape responsibility now. You suggest that the right decisions can't be made if there is a threat that unhinged people are going to act out? I'm suggesting that anything that destroys any chance of peace and provokes violence *is* the wrong decision. Any terrorist attacks will be blamed on TRUMP? Jesus how first worldly can you get! Apparently to you foreigners are idiots or animals who can't control their actions!?? Please tell me you're just an uninformed high schooler and not an adult who failed high school. &gt; Jesus how first worldly can you get!  Considering that we in the first world are intimately aware of how terrorism feels, i'd say my point is spot on. Or have you forgotten 7/7, 9/11, or terrorism in France, Spain, Netherland, etc?  And now that i've read your comment, i've realized i'm talking to a very triggered person. Good luck to you and hope you have a better day from this point on. :) Would you say Trump was "asking for it"? would you say the attackers should have attacked a mcdonalds because it makes "more sense" to react that way to trump's decision?  oh, you already said it. lol A) I did not say that and B) I gave no idea what your point is supposed to be, and I'm guessing from the quality of your other comments that you don't either Yes.  After all of the cold fries I've gotten from McDonald's, I'm going to have to say, Yes. All Jews need to be punished.   -anti Israel activists  &gt; All Jews...   [And that's what is really about] (https://youtu.be/n4Mq63fUwEo). Some people (**see: link**) are enraged that West Jerusalem is the capital of Israel.. *because Jews*.  edit: ..for people who don't know that is the leader of the Palestinian people talking in that video. He [wrote an book and thesis] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Other_Side:_The_Secret_Relationship_Between_Nazism_and_Zionism) about how the Zionists conspired with the Nazis, and the Holocaust was a lie. *Out of all the subjects on Earth that's the one he chose to write about*. I'll leave you to make your own conclusions. &gt; the Zionists conspired with the Nazis  Because it sure would be inconvenient if Palestine conspired with the Nazis. Like the time when Haj Amin el-Husseini was making deals and agreements with Nazi Germany... &gt; are enraged that West Jerusalem is the capital of Israel..  There would be much less of an issue if Israel included the "West" part like you did. The fact that they don't is one of the biggest controversies. &gt; There would be much less of an issue if Israel included the "West" part like you did.   And it would my much less of an issue if the leader of the Palestinians wasn't on their television saying *"Jews defile Jerusalem with their filthy feet"* [and then encourages his people to martyr themselves there] (https://youtu.be/n4Mq63fUwEo).  But we can't have everything we want.. can we? ;) What if the people who go berserk at his announcement are responsible for their own actions?   People whose knee jerk reaction is violence and destruction are a bigger problem than Trump's idiocy.  It's Europe, so I assume the restaurant was fined for having islamophobic glass.  Off course. There’s also a video of police just standing by while it happens. *Terrorist* holding flag of a nation that doesn't exist due to its continuing atrocities commits anti-Semitic attack on Jewish store owner.  These titles need to tell the whole story. &gt;Terrorist holding flag of a nation that doesn't exist  *half of reddit comes screaming for your head* You mean, doesn't exist, and never has existed in the past.  This is a hate crime. Unless you would also have all other hate crimes declared terrorist attacks.  Hate crime  are a better descriptor than terrorism and applying a terrorism designation on a hate crime property crime dilutes the seriousness of both types of crimes.  Also I am a Jew so to prevent someone accuses me of something.  You are a special kind of stupid sir. Do yourself a favor and look up the Sykes Picot Agreement and the Balfour Declaration, fucking nittwit.  It's interesting how the author claims the man was motivated by Trump recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Isreal. Yet nowhere in the article is there a reference to the vandal's claim of motive. Now people will start blaming Trump for middle east unrest.  &gt;Now people will start blaming Trump for middle east unrest.   considering that people predicted trumps actions would leave to more violence, it's totally reasonable to blame him when an increase in violence actually occurs. I'm as repulsed by Trump as anyone else but come on, you have to admit it is unreasonable to hold Trump accountable for this man's actions. No one, least of all Trump, forced or compelled this man to attack the restaurant. Absolutely zero people are responsible for his actions other than himself, regardless of the geopolitical climate.  It’s reasonable to blame trump for anti Jew attacks because Muslims have no control over their own actions/s.  That excuse sounds pretty racist when you stop and think about. You are right - you also don't have to preface your remark by saying you're repulsed by Trump. it's obviously reasonable to blame trump because he was repeatedly told by world leaders not to inflame the Muslim world, that it would lead to violence if he called jerusalem the capital, that it would spark more conflict, that it would be like pouring fuel on the fires of the middle east, etc.  It's actually happening now. So obviously trump is to blame for the unnecessary provocation. I bet it's the battered wife's fault she made her violent husband angry, too. She shoulda known not to make him angry.  who is the wife in this case though? is trump being attacked by that guy in the news story? lol The rest of society, obviously.  ohhhh so if the victim is society (like the woman), then is "society" being blamed, or trump?  see how your analogy falls apart now, or not yet? :P Trump didn’t make Jerusalem the capital of Israel, it has been the capital since 1949. What Trump did was acknowledge it as the capital. The first pillar of the PLO was retaking Jerusalem, the second was using Jerusalem as the base for wiping Israel off the map, the third was killing off all Jews worldwide. Trump acknowledging Jerusalem as Israel capital and placing our embassy there means the US will never support a peace plan that involves giving all of Jerusalem to the pseudo nation Palestine. After 25 years of peace talks Palestine as yet to make a single  concession in the name of peace in the swipe of a pen Trump made them concede  Jerusalem and also said very loudly that the US conceded that Israel has a right to exist as a nation. The creed of  Palestine is that Israel has no right to exist until the Arab nations concede that Israel has a right to exist then there will be no peace. And seriously if we let our foreign policy be dictated by the threat of violence then terrorism works. Well said - thank you. any increase in terrorism and violence will be trump's fault though, because it was forseeable, he was warned by everyone around the world, but he did it anyways. You keep repeating this all over the thread, and it's 100% horseshit.   By your logic, if I threaten to increase violence in response to *literally any policy I choose*, then any policy maker who defies me has blood on their hands. That's so stupid it almost hurts to contemplate, and yet here you are arguing it.   nope, the logic is pretty clear: the violence was foreseeable, trump was warned this would happen by the entire world, he chose to provoke the violence anyways and therefore he is responsible for the provocation.   i'm not even sure what your twisted logic was trying to analogize there, but it's all on you buddy. My logic is clear. :) Confirmed: you're either a troll or a high schooler Confirmed: you're very triggered because logic isn't working for you today. Sorry, but that's just the truth of logic: trump is responsible for the consequences of his decision because those consequences were foreseeable and he had actual knowledge of those consequences, but he decided so anyways.   No escape. Isn't that just another way to get what you want in this world? "Watch out, and don't make us mad or we will hurt you".  it would be, were I a muslim. I'm not though. Trump is a moron and an asshole, but this is not his fault. The Muslim world does not have the right to stop a sovereign nation from recognizing another sovereign nation's legitimate capital. you have a problem with the Muslim world, but not with trump making a terrible decision that he KNEW was going to ignite violence, and now has ignited violence.  EVERYONE told him this would happen, but he chose to do it anyways. He is to blame for his decision. No doubt about it. No, the Muslim world is to blame. I *do* have a problem with everything Trump does. Even this decision, while I would have done the same, was made for completely wrong reasons. Trump essentially just listened to the douchebags in charge of the Republican Party who told them that he has to do this so that they could get the Jewish vote, rather than actually sitting down and thinking about *why* the Jews overwhelmingly vote for Democrats. &gt;No, the Muslim world is to blame.  no, the muslim world isn't to blame for trump's decision... only trump is responsible for that.  maybe you meant the people who commit violence are responsible for their actions, which would mean criminal responsibility. Yes, no doubt. However:  1- this doesn't mean the entire muslim world is criminally responsible for the acts of individuals  2- this still means trump is responsible for the political consequences (again, as opposed to the criminal acts themselves) of his political decision.  No, you don’t blame the president.  You blame the people perpetrating the violence.  You sound like you’re talking about a mad dog that can not control its actions.   of course you blame the president for the consequences of his decisions. duh. You’re going to blame the guy who moved a building, and not the people who commit violence because of we changed the address of our embassy?   that's just semantics, because you know that the true substance of his act is in the fact that it legitimizes israel's claims to jerusalem, thereby forcing generations of people who have lost their lives fighting for the city on the Palestinian sides to accept those deaths as hopeless and in vain.  That sort of decision therefore provokes foreseeable violence that trump knew about, and willingly chose to provoke anyway. Everything we do provokes violence from them, because we are infidel kafir.  Our drawing of breath is haram to them.  I don’t care what they think, and neither does the president, and neither should you.  They need to stop killing people and then I will care what they think. "they're scum anyways!"  yeah, okay.   Looks like you never wanted peace anyways. Hurrah for you.  Meanwhile the civilized world is rightly concerned. Do you count people who think they have a divine obligation to kill infidels as civilized or not? I've made it pretty clear - any decision you make that eradicates peace, leads to further violence - whether religious, or based on racism, economics, your hatred for the color blue, whatever - is the wrong decision.  Your argument to the contrary is what makes you uncivilized. It's interesting to me how fake news gets started but this article and your response seems textbook. All the author had to do was play upon a reader's existing belief and the idea is planted. It's actually pretty impressive in it's simplicity.  I guess they can't say that the restaurant is kosher anymore. I think if we wan peace between Israel and Palestine we should just get the UK to rule it again. So you all can screw it up again? Seriously, look in UK post WWI history. They screwed the pooch in ways that makes the Iraq War look amateur. At least the Palestinians and Israelis could unite in hatred of something else rather than eachother? History is full of people who angry at A, decide to attack B which has little to do with it.  Seriously, he'd have more justification trying to beat up Gal Gadot, who served in the IDF.
 first time that's ever happened. Today or this week? What time is it? He must not have been willing to share.  I thought protocol required the money be entered into evidence before officers could help themselves to it. Maybe that's why he's being accused. This will be unpopular, but get this... Let's say you work at a job where a lot of the public hates you, some people actively try to kill you, and worse it's for the government. You've played all your cards right but you're still just getting by like everyone else... Now it seems tempting, right? I assure you that this is probably the first time he did this but he's been on busts where he's seen at least 50x that amount. 
 Poor Corey - first he was used and abused, then he was not taken seriously and treated like a laughing stock for years. The guy has taken a lot of abuse, I hope this vindication will finally help him to find some kind of happiness or peace and he can live a productive life henceforward. He won't. How can he trust people after what they have all done to him? I feel so bad for the guy.   I heard him in an interview this past summer (before all these scandals came out) and he said Michael Jackson was the nicest most honorable person in the entertainment industry.   I'm starting to believe him and think that maybe these other fucks casted shade on Michael to keep all the attention out of their closed doors.  Apparently these tapes were in with the Michael Jackson case evidence. I guess he tried to tell them that MJ was fine but if they really wanted to catch some pedophiles then here’s a list. Poor guy. Naming pedophiles during an investigation into it and he still wasn’t taken seriously.  Adds a lot of context on why he was so hesitant to drop names Wow this is history changing. A small minute part in the scheme of things but truly big in my life. Crazy I bet most if not all of the people who helped cover this up for who knows who in Hollywood at that police department are retired so nothing will happen. It took something this huge to finally kick Hollywood in the ass to do something, I mean Roman Polanski was/is basically revered in Hollywood like he is some kind of outlaw hero.  Hollywood is a town that chews young people up like logs being put in a wood chipper, sometimes someone good comes out the other side but mostly they are just shredded and end up different people.    I'd be really surprised if anyone involved thinks they were involved with a cover-up. I work in the entertainment industry and also teach a  university class here and there on the side. About a year ago a former student confided abuse to me. I reported it, and several more students came to me and then the floodgates opened and suddenly I was making a documentary. I'm not a documentary filmmaker at all so the whole thing has been harrowing. In the beginning I was just listening and collecting evidence toward finding the "bad guys." And while there were some definite shitty people involved I found that the most egregious, long-lasting wrong-doing was done by people who were just avoiding conflict. It may seem weird to consider looking the other way on abuse or death or rape as avoiding conflict but that's exactly what it is when you're employed by the system where these incidents happen. So a person comes to you and tells you their story and shows you the proof, well that person is an outsider. Conflict would be suddenly identifying with them and this abstract idea of "good" or "right and wrong." So instead you put them through the procedures in place that you know aren't fair. You file them away. You look in the other direction. Maybe you rationalize how it was their fault or rationalize why you had to what you did.   Everyone does this as a way of building a wall between themselves and other people's pain. Homeless people are just junkies. Rape victims are liars or had it coming. Soldiers knew what they signed up for. In the case of my documentary I was startled that so many sports fans absolutely HATED hearing about some student athlete being exploited. HATED IT. And not hated as in they wouldn't tolerate the injustice, hated it because it was bringing reality into their fantasy and because they have this image that the kids are doing their dream jobs and how dare they complain and look at this spoiled kid and that kid who doesn't have to go to class and yada-yada-yada. I hate sports but I was shocked by the hate people have for the actual athletes.   I even had a few professors and staff members tell me that they weren't willing to stand up for victims because they were relying on the university to cover *their* kids' tuition. This was mind-boggling to me; that a parent would look the other way on abuse so that their kid could one day enter that same dangerous territory. But everyone thinks *their* kid won't be stupid enough to get hurt, that *their* kid won't fall into danger. Maybe they're right, maybe they're wrong. But I've found in the past year that the best way of keeping a population in-line and not sticking up for each other is to take away social support systems so that every citizen is terrified of losing their paycheck.  EDIT: thanks for the gold. I’m still interviewing current and former college athletes in SoCal. I can protect anonymity so if anyone wants to talk they can send me a PM.   &gt; But everyone thinks their kid won't be stupid enough to get hurt, that their kid won't fall into danger.  revealing their belief it was the kids stupid fault If people can make themselves believe that the victims were at fault, then they can believe that they can prevent it from happening to themselves. It's Hollywood's unhealthy obsession with youth. They are surrounded by a culture that says preteens modeling for Calvin Klein is edgy. Finding little children attractive has been normalized. "Millie Bobby Brown just grew up in front of our eyes. (She's 13!)" &gt; Millie Bobby Brown  I just looked at some pics of her, just on Google search alone, and whoever posted them are clearly trying to portray her as an adult, and of course she's done the pics because she's 13 and doesn't fucking know any better.  Doesn't this count as exploitation? I pray these kids have parents that go to every event and filming studio with them Polanski gets a ton of sympathy because he's a great filmmaker. And, because his life story is enough to fuck anyone up. He  1) Lost all his family in the holocaust and as a result 2) was a teenaged prostitute in Paris for years. 3) Then his pregnant wife was murdered in their own home, along with five others by the Manson Family.    So, when you finally get down to the hot tub rape at Jack Nicholson's house and his thing for young girls, it just, in context to the time, didn't seem like that big of a deal. At the time, the rape was treated like a party that got out of hand. And, FITW, the agreed upon account of what happened there pales in comparison to any number of other 1970's rapy celebrity sex romps. Additionally, at the time, the sexual exploitation of explicitly underaged girls was a mainstream trope (see Pretty Baby, Taxi Driver, Manhattan) So, there, are a ton of people over the age of 50 who think of him more like Louis CK than, ya know, as a lifelong serial sexual predator.   Public morality has radically changed. It's why my niece thinks the John Oliver/Hoffmann thing is righteous. But, my parents find the whole encounter baffling and unseemly.   EDIT: I'm not a Polanski apologist. Dude is a predator and ought to be dealt with as such. Full Stop.  Let’s not even get started on Woody Allen. I was a fan of his movies. I can't seem to watch them anymore, its not even a conscious decision, it's a guttural response. At this point I think every day Corey isn't swinging from a rope is further proof that he's one resilient man. He's lived a life of pain and mockery, in public. The only video of him where he's sounded remotely normal is the one when he finally names an accuser on television, I think on Dr. Oz iirc. It's like that scene in Lord of the Rings where the spell is broken on the king of Rohan, like he had just come back to reality because now people were listening to him and he could get it off his chest. Very sad moment. I always find it shocking when people still think Jackson is guilty. Most evidence and testimonies have been dismissed or retracted. So heartbreaking. This is the worst thing Corey had to say about Jackson:      &gt;Feldman stressed in his interview with Bashir that Jackson never molested him or touched him improperly and that there was no sexual contact between them. But he said he has re-evaluated his friendship with Jackson and has concluded that there were things that happened in their relationship that were inappropriate and wrong.  &gt;"If you consider it inappropriate for a man to look at a book of naked pictures with a child that's 13 or 14 years old -- then your answer would be yes."  &gt;Feldman says he had such an encounter at Jackson's home when he says they stopped there on the way to Disneyland. "We went to his apartment, and I noticed a book that he had out on his coffee table. The book contained pictures of grown men and women naked. And the book was focused on venereal diseases and the genitalia." Feldman said the singer sat down with him and explained the photos to him.  &gt;Feldman said, "I was kind of grossed out by it. I didn't think of it as a big deal. And for all these years, I probably never thought twice about it ... But in light of recent evidence ... I have to say that if my son was 14 years old -- 13 years old, and went to a man's apartment that was 35, and I knew that they were sitting down together talking about this, I would probably beat his ass."  &gt;In 2001, Feldman and Jackson had a falling out. At the time, Feldman told the press the rift had nothing to do with child abuse allegation that continued to dog Jackson. He actually explained later that the book was about skin diseases. Michael famously had two, vitiligo and discoid lupus. He used to collect old medical books about skin diseases and I guess that's one of them he had laying around. So it wasn't like a book on STDs, though I did find it funny that anyone would think a predator would groom children with "Sex is gross and will kill you" photos. &gt;  guess he tried to tell them that MJ was fine but if they really wanted to catch some pedophiles then here’s a list.  Sounds like they didn't want to catch "some pedophiles".  They wanted to catch MJ.  Since his information wasn't helpful in that regard, it was shelved. Exactly. They weren’t trying to solve a crime, they were trying to arrest someone.  It's really heart breaking if you thinking about it in the context of both of them being molested at different points in their lives. Imagine a young Feldman telling Jackson what had happened to him and Jackson just hugging him and being like "It'll be alright, man. Let's go ride the rides at my private Disney World and forget about life for awhile." This. Me 10 years ago totally thought MJ was a pedo. Now I don't trust any actors/hollywood people EXCEPT Corey Feldman and Weird Al  Can't forget terry crews And Tom Hanks. I just want Tom Hanks unsullied.  Bit late for [that](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3263904/?ref_=nv_sr_1) isn't it? I’m still laughing.  I was nervous to click on that *Dear GOD* God damn it.... slow clap Stick Keanu in that list too and I'm with you. And Bryan Cranston. And Bob Odenkirk. Goddammit, of anyone accused Odenkirk I will die inside.  and Keanu  If Weird Al turns out to be a moleste` I am gonna be so sad.  &gt; moleste`  Is that french for 'touching people'? I never thought he was. I thought he had a mental illness that made him act that way. It's sad; he probably died thinking the world hates him I'm not aware of any evidence that MJ was sexually abused as a child, but he was certainly emotionally abused and probably physically abused. His father was [a notorious bully](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Jackson_(manager\)#Public_image), and a lot of MJ's body image issues seem to have stemmed from that (his dad made fun of his "big" nose all the time, and he grew up to get plastic surgery to get rid of it.)   The mental illness question is something else entirely, that there's been a lot of speculation on and it's something we'll never really know for sure.  Mark Geragos absolutely insists that MJ was innocent.  Now, Geragos was his attorney so of course said that but Jackson is long dead now and Geragos still gets quite animated about it and even says he left his own son to hang around MJ's house that's how unconcerned he was.   And I would add Geragos doesn't always talk in such terms about people he has defended who were guilty. Geragos by all accounts is a pretty decent person and I believe him.  He is a constant guest on the Adam Carolla podcast, and I just get the vibe that he's honest...for an attorney at least. This is my take on the whole MJ thing.  His childhood was taken from him.  He lived his adult life with every other adult treating him like some exhibit at the zoo.  He never had friends because they all treated him differently.  Guess who didn't?  Kids.  They had no idea who the fuck he was.  All they knew was that he had toys and was a nice guy and wanted to have fun with them.  On the surface that sounds creepy as fuck but what about someone who still wants to have a childhood and can't find anyone his own age to do it with?  We may look down on it because we always think someone has ulterior motives but what if the person was actually genuine?  What if MJ was just a sweet, innocent, awesome guy who loved to play with toys and make kids happy?  Take out all the preconceptions and it looks a lot different.  TL;DR: MJ was fucked up due to his upbringing.  It made him yearn for a childhood.  He had the money to do it.  He did it.  People thought he was a perv.  He wasn't actually a perv.   Wanting to hang out with kids is not creepy. Women do it all the time. I request to babysit my friend's kids just so I can hang out with them since I don't have my own. I also teach children at a museum. Kids are excited and accepting and fun to be around. It refreshes me to be around children and helps my depression. I wish men didn't have to worry about looking creepy just because they want to hang out with kids. We need good role models for our children, both male and female.  I love playing around with kids. I think it stems from memories of my uncle who used to always chase us around the yard and throw us around when me and my cousins were growing up. He was a goofball and I remember how much fun I always thought that was and now I try to do the same whenever there's an opportunity.   I have two daughters of my own and at gatherings I'm usually off playing with the group of kids instead of adulting with the other adults. I'm in pretty good shape so I can throw them around in the air and run around quite a bit without getting too tired, plus I count it towards a workout.  I'd like to believe my and the other kids will remember those times like I remember my childhood, running around with my uncle and cousins. My husband stayed home with our daughter for her first three years while I worked. He only actually got the cops called on him at the playground once, but there was never a time when people were like, "oh look, there is a good father". Like, WTF? Expecting dads to not interact with their children is pretty fuckin' unhealthy as a societal norm. Amen drunky! I love staying with my kids. They wanna have friends over? Heck yeah! Let's just out the nerf guns, Xbox, whatever, and have some fun. Life is too short for serious "adult" stuff all the time. Plus kids are way more honest than most adults I have met.  I think that was the problem. Michael had such a terrible childhood (Joe Jackson, may he burn in Hell) so no one really knew what to think. Yes this is a man who had a terrible childhood, and was damaged because of it. The question was how far did that damage go and how did it manifest itself? Everybody knew Michael was acting out the childhood he never had, and that he truly, genuinely enjoyed making children happy. But during all of the fun and games, did things ever get inappropriate? I’m pretty sure a bunch of us did some things during sleep overs in our childhood, that was innocent as children, but would be considered vile if it was between a child and adult. IMO I don’t think people considered Michael a marauding child predator luring children to his rape den, I think people were just concerned about his child-like behavior. Was he an adult enjoying the fun of childhood, or was he delusional? Was he a grown man who believed he was 8-12 years old again? He was a recluse. No one knew where the line was getting drawn. Was he just enjoying the pure joy of being around children, or was he a child himself in his mind, with all of the experimenting, developing crushes, and learning about your body that many people went through in childhood? Like I said, for many of us it was innocent behavior between kids, but it would be unacceptable between a child and adult. So when the accusations came out, people didn’t have to reach far to imagine Michael doing these things. I mean by the time he died, Michael had gone from a young black child with a large nose, to something resembling a nightmarish mannequin. He was obviously damaged, and that is what made the stories so easy to believe.  Edit: I would also like to publicly say, because for years I believed Michael did touch those kids, that I now believe Michael never touched a child. With everything coming out about pedophiles in power and how rampant is, I truly believe Joe Jackson whored Michael out to further his dream of wealth, and I couldn’t imagine Michael touching children after what he most likely went through. I would also like to take this time to say fuck Joe Jackson. FUCK JOE JACKSON. I refuse to call Joe Jackson a sociopath because that implies somewhat that he wasn’t fully aware of what he was doing. Sociopathy is to empathy, what aspergers is to social norms. Extremes sociopaths do not develop empathy, Joe Jackson knew exactly what he was doing and did it anyway. I hope his ring of hell involves Hitler, a pineapple, and hemorrhoids  I'll never forget Geraldo Rivera, who has been named as a rapist and who has confessed to a sickening amount of harassment bordering on sexual assault, yelling at Michael Jackson and calling him a freak after Jackson was found not guilty. Don't worry. I guarantee history will be kinder to Michael Jackson than to Geraldo Rivera. According to some sources the allegations against Jackson just destroyed him personally. That's when he basically stopped taking care of himself and drinking and eventually drugs.  The pain killer addiction started with the Pepsi concert explosion in his face.   I feel sorry for all the times I made fun of Michael when he was still alive.  By now it's pretty established that Michael Jackson most likely never assaulted kids, it's just that it's not common knowledge. It's really shitty how that whole thing got started, a father was so jealous of MJ's gratitude towards his son and family that he made his son lie and say he was molested so he could get a nice payout.  I don't call that Jealousy, I call that greed.  I wish Michael was still alive. I suspect he was the way he as from abuse as well. And I don't really believe he harmed anyone. He was raised a Jehovah's Witness and used to listen to his brothers and father screw fans in his hotel room.  It's a little traumatic to think your family is going to burn in hell.  Also, his brothers teased him and called him ugly.  So we know where the plastic surgery fixation came from.  TBF, Jehovah's Witnesses don't believe in hell. So he would've just thought his father and siblings would be mercilessly killed by God in Armageddon and left to rot and be eaten by birds, along with most of the human population. Which is MUCH better than hell ^/s  Source: Former witness here This song's message is often missed.  One of his greatest hits imo.  https://youtu.be/QNJL6nfu__Q I heard the first accusation against MJ was a scam by some hollywood dentist guy, and people jumped onto the bandwagon after he got a big payout? I may have heard wrong. It's heartbreaking but I have to agree. He can't go back to a "normal life", he's never had such a thing. I'm sure he has enough in the bank to buy a modest home somewhere quiet, but then what would he do? The only thing that will bring feldman peace at this point is justice for his friend, who's death/suicide has clearly damaged him personally.  When you've been through shit like that, nothing brings you peace.  Christopher Ameruoso, Haim's neighbor for a year, said Haim sometimes could be seen wandering around the complex, "looking for companionship, looking for friends".  :( I still see people on the movies subreddit who don't believe him. It blows my mind, this dude has been saying the same thing for decades. Why would he spend so much time on this if it weren't true? [deleted] He's still getting used by all of those who only want to interview him for their ratings.  Dr Oz for example.   Once a commodity, always a commodity. Hopefully not true in his personal life. This is why we need to punish rich criminals like every other criminal in America. He was silenced by wealth. He was silenced by the Santa Barbara pd because they were mainly focused on Michael Jackson and didn’t give two shits about anything but that. Corey was pretty much stating that they’re looking into the wrong individual and need to go after the real creeps. They said nope and sent him on his way. This is why I have always supported him. He and so many other individuals who are abused aren’t taken seriously and need all the support they can get. Like why would he lie about him and Haim getting molested? There’s no reason.   Hopefully after all of this he can start getting roles he deserves in movies and shows again too. He deserves happiness and success.  Sounds like the police dept. didn't want to find this evidence until the pressure got too heavy.  Edit: Thanks. It's always the most flippant, offhand comments that blow up. Also, I did misread. I thought it was the same department, but somehow, this seems even worse. "We always thought that drawer labeled 'Corey Feldman's 1993 audio files naming alleged sexual predators' was a joke!" "Put it with the others" *top* men  Prefer bottom boys "Rape Drawer" ? It was labeled, “Spin Doctor’s Mix,” which is why no one listened to it.  That right there is a tale of corruption &amp; intrigue. I taped over the Spin Doctors.   I would listen to that in a heartbeat Little Miss Can't Be Wrong... social experiment! Barbara Walters got to them. “YOU’RE RUINING AN INDUSTRY!” Or whatever Baba Wawa said, looking away in disgust.  I think she said he was "damaging" the industry. Either way, she's a damn dirty sexual assault apologist.  Barbara Walters and Matt Lauer both epitomize the sort of horrible human being who will always stick to the script.  Celebrity puff pieces and softball critiques are only interrupted by rare takedowns, the latter always devoted to emphasizing norms.  Both careers were exceptional in their mediocrity.  Their ability to always cleave toward the banal and vapid when a moment for serious social critique emerged was absolutely top notch.  This is how such relentlessly bland people became extremely wealthy superstars in American culture.  **Those jobs are actually about missing the point so that viewers will follow suit.** Barbara Walters is the *worst.*   I remember on 2011 or 12 she did an interview of Bashir Al-Assad. She completely tossed him easy softball questions. I lost all respect for her.  Get your hands off me you damn dirty sexual assault apologist! You'we *dam*aging the industwy! You've actuawwy done it! You damaged it! You maniacs! Between Walters and "it wasn't *rape* rape" Roman Polanski ally Whoopie Goldberg, I'm surprised The View isn't putting together rapist support funds. Don't forget "domestic &amp; sexual violence is okay when committed by a woman" Sharon Osborne. If you kill Hollywood, what are they going to prattle on about? She's a company man to the bitter end.  You misread.  The LA PD are the ones who originally "lost" it.  The sheriff's department in Santa Barbara is a different police department.  They found a copy of the original tapes that they had send to LA PD.  Basically, they just threw LA under the bus by locating a copy of evidence LA police had and purposely destroyed.  But don't get too gitty, LA will of course refer any wrong doing to internal affairs and some half retired guy in his 60s might get a few extra days of paid vacation.  The problem here is that police losing the original tapes and not investigating doesn't get around the statute of limitations.  The people he named are still immune to criminal or civil charges.  At most this allows corey better protection from libel suits.  It is up to the public to shame anyone he named, that is about it. I think you misread. Santa Barbara Sheriff's office took the original complaint, and has since turned over their recently "found" evidence to LAPD. &gt;The former child actor claimed in October that he had given the names of sexual predators in Hollywood to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office in 1993 during their investigation into Michael Jackson's molestation charges. The Sheriff’s Office denied those claims, saying they had no records of Feldman revealing such information, until now.  &gt;Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office public information officer Kelly Hoover told Fox News on Tuesday night in an emailed statement, “Following the recent inquiries into the Sheriff’s Office interview of Mr. Feldman in 1993, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office conducted an additional review for any stored items remaining from the Michael Jackson investigation. In a container which included the original reports from the investigation, the Sheriff’s Office located some detective working copies of audio recordings made during the investigation. A copy of Mr. Feldman’s interview was located. The recording is being turned over to the Los Angeles Police Department.  [You seen Street Kings with Keanu?](https://youtu.be/jdHjrd4P9Rs) I fucking loves that movie.  “Us!! We’re straight fucking Nightmares!” before ayer and keanu came along it was going to be sean penn as the dirty cop directed by oliver stone Feel bad for him.   Money talks and bullshit walks. I hope heads roll over whoever never brought these tapes to light sooner, like back in 1993. That’s 24 years. Think of all of the kids that may have  been saved had those cops taken Corey seriously. Rather strange that Time left him out from the people that spoke up against sexual assault in Hollywood.  Yeah since he's one of the main ones and done more than almost anyone. But he has been trying for more than just 2017. I think the saddest part, really, is that he didn't do it when it was the "trend". Which is sick, if you think about it. The same culture that is now trending, exposing these slimeballs across the world, has all but rejected him because his timing was bad. And he took shit for it for all these years. It's fucked man, and it hints at a newer, less understood problem.   This whole idea of something "trending" and crossing the world like a Mexican wave is equal parts fascinating as it is terrifying.  Yup. Trending equals clicks, which equals dollars. All the outlets doing reporting now are only after the click. None of this in new, molestation in Hollywood (don't forget Jimmy Savile and the BBC either) goes back generations.  &gt;Fox News had originally reached out to the Sheriff’s Office in October at which time they responded, “We are aware of the statements that Mr. Feldman is making regarding an investigation in 1993. Our records do not indicate that he named any suspects."   Santa Barbara Sheriffs are assholes, anyway. It's no surprise they either lost the tapes, or (more likely) keep shitty records about things that don't fit their agenda. I love how they got caught with this. They want to keep it quiet so they 'lose' the tapes. Now, with all this public attention, they either have to find the tapes and look like dummies, or say they really did lose them and look like even bigger dummies. I'd like to think that there aren't too many that were present on the force in 1993 who are still there today. Maybe there was enough turnover that someone finally thought to check for the tapes and see if they could make things (closer to) right. There's a lot that still needs to be answered for, but this is at least a step in the right direction. is there proof who watched them? covering up a crime is a crime and if the US gave a shit about justice they would also indict the cops. Well, obstructing justice, if that's what you mean, is a crime. But, not pressing charges over any and all accusations could hardly be automatic obstruction.  Intentionally losing evidence is a crime. Collusion between multiple people would be conspiracy which is also a crime.   Proving that is the hard part. Feldman says he found a cassette copy that was made for him.  &gt; SO NOW THE POLICE R SAYING THEY HAV A COPY OF MY 93 INTERVIEW, BUT THEY CANT RELEASE IT! WELL GUESS WHAT....SO DO I! I WAS RUMMAGING THRU MY GARAGE &amp; CAME UPON THE OLD CASSETTE COPY THE SBPD MADE 4 ME! I HAD NEVER RELEASED IT, BUT NOW I WILL! MAYBE THERES STILL HOPE....    https://twitter.com/Corey_Feldman/status/938526073305776128   Corey wrote this in his autobiography years ago:  &gt; **The audiotapes have long since been leaked to the press—I clearly stated that Michael never touched me, never acted in any way inappropriate. What’s incredible about them, however, is that I admitted that I had been molested; I even named my abuser. The sergeant peppering me with questions, Deborah Linden, breezed right past that. She didn’t seem the least bit interested.**  Corey also notes that after being drugged and molested by one man:  &gt; **I was shattered, disgusted, devastated. I needed some normalcy in my life. So, I called Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson’s world, crazy as it sounds, had become my happy place.** It makes me want to break down weeping to think that Michael Jackson was the one protecting the kids from the abusers all along. Why do you think the entertainment industry and the media came down on MJ so hard? They saw him as a threat and needed to discredit him early, often and loudly. Make a saint look like a sinner and vice versa is what Mass media does. Well hold on here, wouldn't this invalidate the statute of limitations as this means he made a statement very soon after the fact? You'd hope. How is there a statute of limitations on child rape anyway? That's absurd.  From what I can tell, there is a blanket "Statute Of Limitations" on crime in general with an exception for homicide.  The fact that rape of any kind isn't an exception seems to be an oversight as until recently rape really wasn't reported years later.  Iirc California changed that in response to Cosby's allegations however that change is not retroactive The other issue is that until relatively recently DNA evidence wasn't a thing, so you were depending primarily on personal recollection of events. Memory is notoriously untrustworthy and susceptible to suggestion, especially the further back an incident happened. A statute of limitations made sense back when these kinds of crimes were he said, she said affairs. Now people need to get the right politicians in office to get them updated for modern society. I’m not sure, but it seems it would. I think new evidence/rediscovery of old evidence should be enough to give it the classification of an ongoing case. No, charges have to be brought before the deadline, not just accusations. I always heard as a kid that kid stars ended up a bit whacky when they grow up in Hollywood. I guess we all know why now. Sadder than I had imagined. Yeah. Growing up it was always thought "oh they are spoiled so they become alcoholics, drug addicts, etc." Now I am thinking a lot of it could be due to molestation.  This honestly amazes me. Just a year ago everyone said he was a weird dude making shit up. People said there were not any issues with child rapists in Hollywood. Well it’s now their day of reckoning and the suppressed voices will be heard.    Yep, and now somehow everybody says "everybody knew already, it's not news..." hypocrites... what matters is that proof on tape, no rumors or allegations, that is news. If Shawn and Gus were there they wouldn't have had any problems finding the files. This will be the plot for tomorrow's movie  Edit: for those who don't have USA, it usually shows up next day for sale on Amazon video You know that's right... C'mon son! I’m psychic detective Shawn Spencer, this is my partner, Charles in Charge Don't you mean Lavendar Goomes?  Or me? Are you telling me there's a Psych movie and it airs tomorrow?  You know that's right  Tomorrow night on USA! How the heck can I watch the show show? I never saw the last season. Pirate it? your local library can get you the DVD's You can buy it on Amazon or dvd. Thanks for the reminder! I am Shawn Spencer, psychic detective for the Santa Barbara Police Department, and this is my associate, Ovaltine Jenkins Don't you mean Original G-String AKA the Crowd Pleasa ? Is this ironic?:  &gt; Feldman, 46, had claimed in a Today show interview with Matt Lauer that he “sat down and I gave them names. They're on record. They have all this information.” It's so disturbing to watch that interview again after the allegations came out against Matt Lauer. He was so aggressive towards Corey for no reason at all. Creep. Well, it wasn't for no reason... Someone on here suggested a while back that the people who go hardest against certain kinds of offenses are actually perpetrators of those offenses.  Starting to look true imo. Just like all those anti-gay politicians that turn out to be gay themselves I forgot his name and the exact joke, but there's a comedian who had a joke around all the politicians who were so adamantly against homosexuality actually being gay themselves - like maybe the thing we hate the most is who we really are.  So he was afraid of actually being a giant spider. Matt Lauer heard to mumble in reply "OK, have to get these guys on the phone"  Matt lauer heard to mumble “sheeeeeeeeeiiit” Barbra Walters also told one of the Cory’s (can’t remember if it was Feldman or Haim) that if they broke the story they’d be “damaging the industry”  wow. this was one of the biggest claims against him. &gt; Fox News reached out to Corey Feldman and the Los Angeles Police Department but did not receive comment.  All Corey Feldman's going to say is, "I told you so." I hope Corey tells them all to fuck off and writes a bestselling tell-all, naming names. A bunch of sphincters in Hollywood just tightened up. And junk still fell out... "found"   Like they had been misplaced, and not intentionally squirreled away where nobody could find them. Interesting that he has always defended accusations against Michael Jackson with his only complaint being that Michael abandoned their legitimate friendship. Michael was no doubt a victim himself Well his childhood was basically having his dad beat him for missing a note and pretending to be asleep while his older brothers fucked groupies in the hotel rooms they shared. It's because if you actually read about the case against Michael it was all bullshit. It was definitely odd that he held sleep overs with children, but both cases where he was accused were recanted by the children when they were adults and admitted that their parent / lawyer had coached them on what to say to the police. There's even a phone recording of the child's father in the first case admitting that he was going to ruin Michael's life with the things he'll make his son say and that he was going to get all of his money. Michael's estate is still worth a ton of money and you're telling me that out of all the hundreds of kids he had come over that it was only 2 kids if he had been molesting them? Literally every other kid they tried interviewing for sound bites at the time came to Michael's defense. He had a damn movie theater built to hospital level standards so terminally ill children could go to the movies safely. All he cared about was making these kids lives better than his was.  i have heard it said several times that if the MJ allegations had happened during the internet age, they'd have been shredded in seconds for the obvious money-grabs that they were. I also read that they got into his porn collection and the only thing shocking about it was how vanilla and hetero it was.  I think there were claims of child pornography being found, but they turned out to be an art book with a painting containing cherubs.  Basically. Some argue that he was already under FBI investigation for 10 years so there is no way he would keep evidence around.  They found some hetero porn usage online, but from what I've read he was not really that sexual of a person. And I don't think there is anything wrong with that. I don't think so either. I read Corey's book on a whim a few years back and I believe it. MJ was odd, that is true, but a pedophile? No. When someone is weird in ways that make them an easy target, damn right people are going to use their kids as money grabs.  It actually saddens me and makes me wonder if he wouldn't have been around longer had his image not been tarnished.  &gt; Literally every other kid they tried interviewing for sound bites at the time came to Michael's defense.   And some of the kids apparently even were saying "Michael didn't but I can tell you who did!" and they weren't interested in the criminals because they were after Michael. This should be the top comment. All the child stars who were close to Michael Jackson never said a bad thing about him, but they are all coming out against OTHER people in Hollywood. It's entirely possible that Michael was actually protecting them. Macaulay Culkin always said the accusations against Michael were ridiculous, and Hollywood sure enough left his career to rot too. Imagine that we find out that Michael's mansion and park and everything were built for kids who were being abused and he basically was the one person kids hung around with to feel safe. Neverland Ranch. A place to get away from the creepy adults and other dangers of the world, and never grow up to become one of them.  Odd coincidence that one of Michael's best friends was a "Lost Boy". The hero they needed and the one they deserved? I'd be willing to bet on that  Very unconfirmed theory.  But I've read that real abusers in Hollywood went after Michael Jackson because of his close relationship with Corey Feldman. The genesis of this police questioning was the Santa Barbra PD trying to nail Michael Jackson on charges related to the Chandler's accusations. Corey Feldman didn't give the police the big scoop they were looking for, so they completely ignored his legitimate testimony about real predators.   People often simplify Michael Jackson's relationships with children as being a simple way of returning to his lost childhood, while it's true to a certain degree, Michael was actually a very huge child's rights activist. His relationships with Emanuel Lewis, Corey Feldman, Macauley Culkin, etc. were premised on a desire to ensure that, as child stars, they were able to have fun times, enjoy childhood activities, and not always feel the pressure of working. It's also why Jackson had a strong relationship with Elizabeth Taylor - another celebrity with a childhood in the entertainment industry.   Michael Jackson also gave a very passionate speech at Oxford in 2001 which reveals a lot about his philosophies on child welfare and goes into certain detail about his own childhood:   https://youtu.be/-TDMiRuhFPg   Well corey always said MJ was good to him and didn't hurt him and iirc, he said he even protected him. just imagine how much could have changed from then to now if the powers that be ACTUALLY protected the people and did their fucking job that they swore to do that our tax money went towards. 24 FUCKING YEARS! imagine all the other stuff they "lose" and ignore. Our system is a fucking joke.  Oh NOW they suddenly found them  My, what an incredible lucky amazing fortunate coincidence. My dad worked for defense contractors and the government.  People hiding documents that their superiors want destroyed is a total thing. Mostly done for career insurance reasons. The suspicion by your superiors that you might have access to damaging information makes them leave you alone. When things were paper you could pull the index sheet and the documents would 'disappear' put the index sheet back in or leave it where it'll be found and...  Absolutely possible that someone in the Sheriff's department made sure it was kept.  It was in the big box labeled “Hollywood Sexual Predators Evidence: Feldman. File under F” in the “Hollywood Sexual Predators Evidence Archive” Section F of the “Hollywood Sexual Predator Case File Evidence Warehouse” that was originally an airplane construction facility.  So that's where Indi left the ~~holy Grail~~ Ark.   It would have been nice to see him validated on the cover of Time magazine... He's been telling this story for decades but apparently he's just too weird to put in their magazine or something? &gt;SO NOW THE POLICE R SAYING THEY HAV A COPY OF MY 93 INTERVIEW, BUT THEY CANT RELEASE IT! WELL GUESS WHAT....SO DO I! I WAS RUMMAGING THRU MY GARAGE &amp; CAME UPON THE OLD CASSETTE COPY THE SBPD MADE 4 ME! I HAD NEVER RELEASED IT, BUT NOW I WILL! MAYBE THERES STILL HOPE....  From Feldmans twitter just a while ago...  How convenient.  I wonder who gave them the ok to find it. The better question is I wonder who coerced them to lose it in the first place Please tell me a **copy** of the recordings was handed over to the LAPD, and Santa Barbara PD kept a copy! And time magazine doesn't even mention him  I wonder how all these people that openly mocked him for refusing to name them feel now? I was to grow as him as an 'idol' so for the longest time I just thought he was a weird Hollywood dude. Then in 2008 I got really into anything true crime and came across his accounts of being molested and abused. Ever since then when ever I see him in an interview, with everyone mocking him, I just feel sick. Grown men and women are the direct product of their childhood and traumas.    Glad to see so many supportive comments here on Reddit  What sucks even more about this is that people always criticize victims of sexual abuse for not going to the police or telling anyone in law enforcement and Corey did exactly that.  Somehow it still got pushed aside.  His whole life could have been different if he had been taken seriously.   Any reason why he wasn't on the cover of Time Magazine? As a woman I would have found the cover even more empowering if there were men too. It makes it seem like it's a women's movement  He should be front and centre.  Jesus Christ... poor guy. 24 years. 24 years of being ignored after you sought help. I've seen some people talk about how Corey Feldman is a douchebag now, I don't know much about it but maybe there's a reason for it, yeah? If all this is true (which it may or may not be) then he was exploited since childhood and even when he asked for help then he got fucked again too.  I imagine that can have some negative effects on a person. And if it does it's not entirely their fault. About fucking time this poor dude is vindicated. Talk about a Lost Boy. You can just tell this bloke has had a hard life , I never doubted him, the things he said were to "revealing or embarrassing or career damaging" to be anything BUT the truth , I'm glad he's finally being believed, also glad the police admitted thier mistake . There's nothing worse than not feeling believed when  you bare your soul , and tell all of the horrible "little secrets" for it to all be covered up. Hopefully they can put together a historic case but I know USA has limits on that  Think of this whenever you ask, "why did they wait so long to say anything?" This poor man has been telling the same horrendous story from the beginning and has been ridiculed for it. I hope he gets justice, better late than never. It's a Christmas miracle! I'm curious, let's say that Feldman had given the police all they needed to arrest somebody and nothing was done (perhaps due to lost evidence).   Now the stature of limitation is more or less out of the window, so what happens? Information found, guilty parties known, but nothing because it's too late?   Or will it be new evidence being found changing things?   Or that evidence existed, but was lost, yet had the evidence been handled correctly then it would have led to arrests?   Does that change anything or does this now go into the category of "too little, too late"?  They are gonna kill corey...he may just turn up overdosed or suicide'd  I know it doesn't matter to Corey personally, but I still feel like I should apologize to him. I'm a couple years younger than he is, so all we ever heard was those crazy wild Hollywood kids, so into drugs and out of control. Nobody ever even thought they were reacting to something horrible that was happening to them. I wish I hadn't thought all those terrible things, and I'm glad that he at least is living to see some kind of consequences for his abusers. (At least I hope he does. We're there now as a society, right? Like, people who rape kids have consequences now? That's a thing we're doing?) FUCK YOU, BARBARA WALTERS. You sick demented bat. Incase some do not know what I am referring to. She called him a liar to his face when he mentioned it on the view.
 &gt;Ajit Pai is the type of Indian guy who eats dosa with a fork.  Whoa! I can't even show that to my children! (and that was a Hard R on the fork!) &gt; sceptic  What the fuck makes being against it a 'sceptic'? What the hell is he questioning about it? Seems like they’re trying to downplay his role in this. “Innocent man attacked with words”  Maybe they meant septic because he's a fucking disease on humanity He can just ignore him like he did the America public. One thing I’ve learned since going to college and subsequently being surrounded by Chinese and Indian immigrants to the US is that the only people who hate Indians more than the Chinese are other Indians. He probably would be a Thuggee. He deserves every bad thing that comes his way.  Even his kids getting hurt? You're sick and need help I doubt that they're advocating for that, come on, now. Its a-ok to be shitty if you dont like the person /s Lol people were trying to justify his kids getting attacked over this  Seriously it just makes them look even more shitty than him  [It seems pretty hypocritical to make those tweets, and also make this documentary.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Problem_with_Apu)  Using race to mock others contributes to the acceptance of racial stereotypes being brought up in the documentary. 
 I mean, ok, but it’s not like babies use their brains for a whole lot anyways.    They don’t even know how to read. I bet you're a gynaecologist Nope. Ass, nose, and throat specialist  I can has be taken damage of brain of child time. Maybe how it was pollution? They see. They see.  When me President, they see. They see. End net neutrality. Not even pollution-damaged brains think that's a good idea. Better fix the babie's brain over polution. Probably all human brains are. globally any top soil exposed after diesel engines went mainstream, have lead. And the first, i think its 6 inches, of snow are not safe for consumption because of all the toxins it cleans out of the air. But assuming stagnate air flow, you can eat the 7+ inches. Yes, babies shouldn't watch TV. Black Carbon (soot) and other particulate pollution is the biggest enemy to humanity. But we have an entire industry built around demonizing Co2 that it takes a back seat in public awareness and governmental regulation.  It's really a travesty. Because you look at what happened in the UK where they phased out gas engines in favor of diesel engines (to lower their Co2 imprint) and now they are dealing with more smog and particulate pollution a decade later. Untold millions are breathing that shit in on a daily basis.   Good thing the current administration wants to get rid of those pesky regulations and the EPA! Just to add to your point, they are also pro life, they care so much for the women, children and the less fortunate, as long as it doesn’t affect the “creation of jobs (profits)” . EPA it’s only there to destroy our economy and ‘merica.  Good thing I'm only already born. ... then they grow up to become politicians. If that were true all the chinese children would be brain damaged and they seem smart enough It's almost as if you didn't read the article and just posted your opinion blindly.  That saves em time from reading the article and then posting their opinion blindly anyway. they're all stupid, they should revolt but are dumb and compliant
 This is about the long game. Net Neutrality supporters hit the streets and publicly protest where people will see them. Get attention.   Telecoms have played the long game well. Net Neutrality was codified as government policy in 2010 with The Open Internet Order. Net Neutrality was a gentleman's agreement for years before that.   Verizon sued The FCC saying that they had no basis to do that. Title 2 as a public utility came about in 2015 as a result.   Now, The telecoms have their guy, Ajit Pai, as the head of The FCC. He has put all of his capital into repealing Net Neutrality.   The public comment period showed 98% of all human comments pro net neutrality. Pai said doesn't matter.   The Attorney General of NY State is investigating the comment period and millions of robot comments against Net Neutrality. The FCC and Pai are stonewalling.   12 senators requested that the Dec. 14th vote be delayed. That is pressure! Pai refused and called net neutrality supporters "desperate."   Pai is strong arming and not bothering to hide that the Dec. 14th vote will end net neutrality.  There is even a poison pill saying that localities cannot pass net neutrality laws.   So, telecoms have local monopolies and we are beholden to them. Imagine the net where you cannot go to Facebook without a charge or if Netflix is blocked in favor of Comcast Streampix.   AT &amp;T had a decision in their favor a few days ago where The FTC cannot regulate AT &amp; T as an ISP. No Net Neutrality will mean total power and no oversight.   Imagine how that would be....  The FCC will be sued post haste when The FCC repeals net neutrality. It's a delaying action. If The telecoms block sites, throttle Netflix, etc., that will make people angry.   Watch people go mental when they can't see their porn!  Net Neutrality is supported by over 70% of voters Democrat and Republican.   Net Neutrality supporters are trying to energize those people to demand a congressional solution.  Well, shit... what can we do to stop this? Like where do we vote? ~~or build an army~~  Edit: Shit, wait. If this passed it'd make it possible for your internet provider to block websites, right? If that's possible what if the government can pass laws to block websites now that there's a platform to do it? Welcome to what's called "the slippery slope"  This is exactly why this is so important.  If the majority of this country wants net neutrality and they steamroll everyone on this, it sets a new precedent. Isn't the "slippery slope" a fallacy? Or do people on say that when someone says something they agree with may become a slipper slope?    It's really hard to keep track of these things now.  I believe the fallacy is *assuming* everything will be a slippery slope. Some things truly are one though, so I think the term can still be used. It's only a fallacy if the other party is using it as an argument.  Edit: just so I'm not so snarky, slippery slope is a phenomenon borne out by history. It began to be called a fallacy when it was used against certain progressive laws for fear they would take it too far. So slippery slope is not an argument about what must logically follow. It is essentially a statement that you do not trust the other person. That's more on the philosophical side of whether or not it constitutes as a fallacy or not.  In the debate world, a slippery slope is a sneaky way of dismissing anything your opponent proposes without engaging their argument.    It's an obvious fallacy when extreme stretches are used.  Imagine, you're running for office.  Your opponent proposes to lower pollution by introducing a carbon tax based on the size of your car's engine.  You, having stayed up all night on a bender, weren't prepared and say "If we allow a carbon tax, what next?  Taxing the air we breathe because the human heart is an engine and produces a carbon emission!"  You bypass your opponent's argument by introducing a crazy distortion of what they argued.  The concern that government, or other entities, will abuse the platform that killing net neutrality off provides them is not extreme whatsoever.     The Patriot Act is an example of this.  Some feared it would introduce a slippery slope that would be detrimental to one's privacy.  The bigger fear was terrorism and, because of that, it passed.  At the time, the idea of mass persistent surveillance wasn't much a reality.  That was until social media became big and all government had to do was ask Microsoft, Apple, FB, or Google.  While it's for "security" and people willingly gave this information by owning a PC, iPhone, a FB profile, or a Gmail account...we're still bothered by the loss of privacy on the Government's perspective and the right to be forgotten by the entities maintaining this information.    Given the behavior of Government and conglomerates, it's no stretch of the imagination they'd abuse it because they have done so in the past.    We're not saying "The government has abused their power once, so we can't trust them to conserve our parks and wildlife."    We're saying "Government overreach with legislating the internet has happened once before and we're concerned it's going to happen again with the death of net neutrality."  That is the way I take it to mean at least.     It doesn't need government interference to lead to harsh censorship. The wealthy donors backing political parties can buy preferential treatment for their politics and pay to censor their opponents. As soon as large infrastructure monopolies have the freedom to control what people see, wealthy political interests will start maneuvering to take advantage. Also called cable.  Call your congress person and join a protest. There's a DC protest on the 14th at the FCC. I think that's all we can do now. One problem: the FCC not regulating ISPs and preventing states from regulating them is, in short, unconstitutional.  The FCC, a federal department, regulates the internet right now.  If they decide to stop regulating it, then under the 10th amendment, which states that the powers not given to the federal government are left to the states, which can easily be interpreted as things not regulated by the federal government is left to the states. It's a delaying action. If it takes 4-5 years like title 2, many actors like the President and FCC Commissioners change.  Even in 2018, the House and Senate could flip. That would change things to folks who could be amenable to Net Neutrality. it seems even the former FCC chairman believes Ajit will fuck shit up.  https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/tom-wheeler-slams-ajit-pais-plan-to-kill-net-neutrality-rules/  So let's not even count that as being considerate of them doing. Even if it is unscontitutional they will still do it for as long as they can and got knows how slow the courts are doing things. Even if the courts work to revert it it will take months might even pass over a year before the whole thing is taken down and by then the damage will be long done. Hell they might even have made enough propaganda and supported corrupt politicians to kill healthcare by then. I think this is all a push to elect more corrupt politicians and their ball game is to kill things such as our healthcare among other programs to fill their pockets as quick as possible. Wouldn't Net Neutrality be in force as long as a legal action was being pursued?  My view of Pai's attitude is, "I make the rules, so try and stop me, I dare you."  The Order that Pai is pushing as a repeal reads like a Christmas present to telecoms. I bet that an ISP lobbyist wrote that order.  Not really accurate. The 10th Amendment has been interpreted by the Supreme Court as little more than a tautology. That is, an obvious consequence of the federal government's enumerated powers. When the Constitution assigns specific powers to the federal government, it only stands to reason that all other powers do *not* belong to the federal government.     The federal government can and does preempt the several states on a variety of issues, and declining to regulate ISPs *in a particular manner* does not automatically mean that states are free to do so. Particularly where that state action would interfere with the federal government's action or purposeful inaction in that area.     Thr federal government's net neutrality policy will not be upended by the 10th Amendment.  How would this affect freedom of speech, what if he pushes this through and among blocking competitor web services, they also block access to sites where people complain about them or that people use for organization to fight back which could include reddit for example?  You now have to pay by the word to bash Trump.  I'm about to take out a second mortgage.  &gt; Net Neutrality was a gentleman's agreement for years before that.  Maybe you aren't talking about this far back, but... In the 90's (my mind is kinda hazy due to the fact that I was in college back then, but), I seem to recall that the reason ISPs didn't 'look' at the packets, was the slippery-slope that they could, potentially, be held responsible for the content (or that seemed to be the perception, true or not). i.e. one of their clients tx/rx child porn, or strong encryption to outside of US border, or mp3s...  I guess this isn't a fear anymore, because of the size of the ISP's effective monopolies... like Ma Bell, all over again, only now with 33% MORE regulatory capture!  Thanks for you concise summary, well done. &gt;Maybe you aren't talking about this far back, but... In the 90's (my mind is kinda hazy due to the fact that I was in college back then, but), I seem to recall that the reason ISPs didn't 'look' at the packets, was the slippery-slope that they could, potentially, be held responsible for the content  You can thank the Patriot Act and the War on Terror for that change. ISPs had to install packet monitoring technology. LEOs and security angencies can secure warrants or get secret authorization under the Patriot Act to start snooping around in there.  ISPs resisted because of the cost. They lost. Then they realized they could make more money by throttling stuff. Hence why we started battling for Net Neutrality.   Edit. To those claiming slippery slope fallacy, remember were going to lose Netflix because of the War on Terror. Pai and company are using the Radio/TV broadcasting argument. ISPs own all content sent on the networks used.   Wrong. The Internet is a connect series of networks. But The internet is like a road. The ISPs may have the pavement, but none of the supplies, people or transports on that road are owned by ISPs.   Net Neutrality means I can get in my "car" and go anywhere I please on that Net that I can access using the road.   The ISPs are saying since they have the road, all of the cars, supplies on that road are owned by them.   ISPs are saying that since they have the road, all the buildings, content, people, and everything in the surrounding counties are owned by ISPs as well.   That is a false argument.  The long game you say? Sort of like voting for a candidate for president that you might not like 100% but holds a valuable position on net neutrality? Too bad more people didn't play the long game November 2016. If they had, we wouldn't be talking about this.  Both sides are the same though, so voting doesn't matter herp derp... TLDR FCC is corrupt We need FCC to regulate the internet &gt; So, telecoms have local monopolies and we are beholden to them. Imagine the net where you cannot go to Facebook without a charge or if Netflix is blocked in favor of Comcast Streampix.   Aren't there already laws in place to prevent anti-competitive practices such as this? The FTC was ruled against last week. They can't regulate AT &amp;T.   The FCC will not regulate. So nope, nothing. Where are you protesting at? Its unfortunate that Pai has already made up his mind. Even after thousands upon thousands of public comments that he himself asked for, he determined that none of them were vital to his decision. Asshole It was over 22 million complaints filed when I filed mine earlier.  You would think 22 million people complaining would be indicative of a problem, but no, Verizon dollars run him. But 300 million didn't complain so majority rules,  right? /s  Edit: I wasn't actually serious Terrible logic, I work at a massive telecom and I know the damage this legislation is going to do.  (I actually already saw some of the damage live back before the FCC regulated it through Tom Wheeler.  Now it's going to be way worse than before.) Do you know if or when any of this will backfire on the telecoms? It's just going to make life miserable for everyone, create artificial congestion points, artificial throttling (between even the big telecoms.)  This happened a few years ago with Comcast artificially limiting netflix traffic to extort more money out of them.  So every telecom is going to try to cut each other's throats between every ASN and switch/router/netflow systems and end users are going to suffer as a result.  It also paves the way for prioritized traffic, which could harm small businesses and startups that want to try to compete with bigger corporations that can pay for 'priority' traffic.  It's unnecessary, we all get shittier service for higher prices, and it's a cash grab straight up.  Just all bad for everyone involved (except the big telecoms who get to price gouge.) How much money do you think he stands to make? Can’t we all just pitch in a couple bucks to make that money hungry asshole go away and leave our shit alone. All that will do is double his take. He has wealthcock all the way down his throat, he worships that rich dick. We don’t matter. it's unfortunate but thousands upon thousands of dollars speak louder. Why don't thousands of people go to his house and take a shit on his lawn together.  Seriously, do that once a day for a week and it's bound to make an impact.  Do we have enough law enforcement to stop 50k people from shitting?  There is only one way to find out. Not his house. Go to the houses of the CEOs of big ISPs. They're the ones running the show. We can hit a new house each day.  A roaming band of shitters. They’ll just underpay someone to clean it up. They need to fear for their safety. He didn't make up his mind, he received the winning bid for his allegiance. Ajit Pai paid up his mind. He is obeying wealth. This is why he doesn’t deserve to feel safe in our society. Someone needs to dox his ass. Why not like Comcast centers, att stores etc?  I presume this is because Ajit Pai was a lawyer at Verizon. His title, as  stated on the [FCC's website](https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership/ajit-pai), was Associate General Counsel. That same page shows that, after graduating law school in 1997, he held 8 jobs over the next 15 years before being appointed Commissioner at the FCC in 2012, where he stayed for the 4 year term, before being appointed Chairman in January 2017. I don't know how much influence his 3 years at Verizon 14 years ago has had on his philosophy today. However, it is a point of contention as he is the only member of the FCC leadership to have worked directly for a telecommunications company. Other Redditors have hypothesized that after Net Neutrality would die, he'd return to Verizon for work and receive a hefty pay hike for helping them out. More than a hefty pay raise. They'll be beholden to him, they will be erecting statues of him at headquarters.  Can you imagine that extremely punchable face as a 15 foot bronze statue? Yuck. Pull them down. Fuck, he might just get promoted to CEO. He runs for president in 2024 Because Ajit Pai used to work for Verizon. *Ashit Pile *A shit pie Seriously, net neutrality already doesn't apply to cell service. That's why they able to offer deals that don't use your data if you're using certain websites. ... are you being serious? Verizon is an ISP, the data plan you pay for grants you access to the internet. With this passing, they now have the right to block, slow, or fast-lane whatever apps, websites, and services pay them most.  All I'm saying is that it isn't that different from what wireless providers are already allowed to do. Data caps combined with some sites not using your data is something that is allowed already and goes against the principles of net neutrality. &gt;Seriously, net neutrality already doesn't apply to cell service.   That's not true. Wired and wireless internet are both under Title 2.  &gt;That's why they able to offer deals that don't use your data if you using certain websites.  Can they really do this? They definitely don't have to follow the same rules as ISPs. I've heard several radio offers that advertise this as a selling point. As long as this is allowed then net neutrality doesn't exist for cell providers as far as I'm concerned. I'm personally fine with limiting my mobile data usage, as long as companies don't take away truly unlimited home and business internet. I'm on Wi-Fi at a bar now, and usually am at home. I pay monthly for 10GB LTE, and it's more than enough, if I utilize Wi-Fi whenever possible.  But if they take away unlimited home internet, I will make sure my elected representatives know that we need full consumer protection when it comes to access to the internet in a free and American way. The internet is not able to be parceled out like television. With t-mobile you can stream YouTube, Spotify, and Netflix without cutting into your data limit.  It's called zero rating. In Canada the practice is illegal. You can offer say a free subscription to Spotify premium as a part of your bundle but you can't exclude Spotify data from your data cap. Is it different in the US? Yes it must be different in the USA, because that is definitely what T-mobile does  Yup! On my T-mobile plan I pay extra so my music streaming isn't counted towards my 10gb cap. I hate admitting it but it feels like a good deal to me. &gt; net neutrality already doesn't apply to cell service.  Wireless, satellite, and cellular providers absolutely are included in Title II. Right.  The only reason zero-rating stuff exists is because they’re currently doing it illegally.  One of Pai’s first actions was to shutdown investigations into these situations. Source? Not that I don't believe you, I just want to have the source handy the next time I have to convince someone NN is important. From 2016:  https://www.reuters.com/article/us-at-t-directv/u-s-fcc-says-it-has-serious-concerns-about-att-direct-tv-mobile-video-service-idUSKBN1352KL  Really looked for a decent source on the dropping of this, but couldn’t find it picked up by anybody I like:  https://www.thewrap.com/fcc-drops-investigation-sponsored-zero-rating-data-plans-net-neutrality/  Edit:  The WSJ picked it up.  They’re actually doing some good reporting these days:  https://www.wsj.com/articles/fcc-ends-zero-rating-review-1486157682 Cool. Thanks for that :) I just remember it.  Let me see if I can dig it up. Verizon will be offering a QuickProtest(tm) lane with premium complaints, along with a BaseProtest(tm) lane that you'll need to wait for. Which protest lane will you be participating in?  Well boys the Internet was fun while it lasted anyone wanna fund a state wide LAN server with a enough porn to last a couple decades? Maybe they should concentrate on the FCC? Verizon stores are nearer. And have less guards. And are more visible. A Washington March would also be effective but you’ll get more people asking about it if they see the protests in person.  As long as every single sign talks about Net Neutrality. You're all taking about protesting in front of a Verizon WIRELESS store, an entity that millions of people have bad feelings about.   If I was unaware of the net neutrality debate and saw a bunch of people protesting in front of a Verizon Wireless store, my first instinct would be "yeah! Fuck those data overage fees"  Bear in mind, wireless networks are not beholden to any Net Neutrality rules. Verizon Wireless is looking to compete with those services with their 5g network in 2 years or so, so they would be very happy with NN going away.  As a side note, they are also selling their users data.  I went into one a couple days back and left a few phones on the battle for the net website. That sure must have confused some people when they found out that none of that applies to Verizon Wireless, or any cellular service. Or maybe they are still confused, join the protest, and will look like idiots on TV when a reporter points that out. Cellular, wireless, and satellite providers also fall under Title II. Well Spectrum doesn't have any cellphones in there office. May I ask why Verizon Wireless and not  Communication stores? Doesn't that just confuse the issue since this effects home internet services and not cell phones? I think the main connection is that Ajit Pai worked for Verizon. Right. Verizon at large though right? Unless I'm mistaken. I'm sure that wireless stores are ubiquitous though so that's probably the reason. Just concerned the message gets lost since that's super confusing. Well, then go to an ISP office yourself and protest. I'm not being sarcastic. I've been talking to people outside of spectrum in KC and telling them about net neutrality for the last three days. My sign says "call congress! call the FCC! Save Net Neutrality." I hand out slips of paper with the phone numbers for our representatives and the FCC.  My point is that we can waste our last 8 days having conversations online being concerned about if a protest is perfectly designed, or we can get our asses out on the street and talk to people. Most consumers don't know about this issue, but as soon as you explain it to them they want to protect net neutrality. I already planned on it. I simply asked a question.   &gt;My point is that we can waste our last 8 days having conversations online being concerned about if a protest is perfectly designed, or we can get our asses out on the street and talk to people. Most consumers don't know about this issue, but as soon as you explain it to them they want to protect net neutrality.  Me talking about it now doesn't prevent me from protesting tomorrow. And furthermore it may cause people to think and be prepared as you are to be extremely clear about what you are protesting. If people just show up with anti-Verizon signs I'm just concerned the message might get lost.   I'll print up a nice big sign that says "net neutrality" on it for those who are confused. I assume others will too.  Exactly my point. Cellular, wireless, and satellite providers also fall under Title II.   &gt; Bear in mind, wireless networks are not beholden to any Net Neutrality rules  and yet I have unlimited data and the speeds just keep getting better and better. It's almost like the free market works, just a couple years ago you were paying the same price for 5gb of 3g. Remember that 480p (or 720p, depending on what tier you buy) streaming video cap Verizon has now. And the throttling after X number if gigs. And hotspot functionality is capped at 600kbps.    In the early days of data (10 years ago), there weren't caps on anything. Unlimited was unlimited.  Like when there was no HD video or hotspots even available? The technology was crap, it being "unlimited" was basically useless. Not to mention it being insanely expensive.  The market has visibly altered the way phone companies have delivered data plans for the better. A market not protected by net neutrality. And let's not pretend Verizon (along with Comcast, Time Warner, AT&amp;T, ect) isn't the one pulling the strings when it comes to what's going on with the FCC right now. Honestly I'm surprised SPRINT isn't a massive monopoly. The name comes from the Southern Pacific railroad company, they built the lines and yet somehow haven't ever been on the level of Rockefeller.   **S**outhern **P**acific **R**ailroad **I**nternal **N**etwork **T**elecommunications. They were pioneers, but I suppose they weren't greedy enough.  Wasn't pretending that at all, sorry if it sounded that way. Just saying that not everyone can take time off and make the trip to the FCC HQ. I was just adding to your comment.  Wasn't trying to refute it. And it will be easy for me to upgrade my data plan while I'm there.  Wait. Shit. I'm not good at protests. Who do you think owns the FCC? Ashit (Ajit) Pai is in Verisons pocket.  They're just protesting the parent company. I was debating whether or not to take that day off work. Hopefully the protests are still going on after 4:00. Can't wait for the riots to break out tomorrow. Thanks a lot, Pai, you cunt. Bell is currently lobbying for total censorship of p2p and streaming protocols in Canada because everyone is cutting their cords to paid subscription tv and they are bleeding money.  I use p2p to download legal files from www.ocremix.org, but to Bell I'm a pirate... Wtf?  The internet is under attack by greedy mutha fuckas clear across North America. Holy shit, OCRemix is still a thing? Wow. That really takes me back. I've still got MIDI remixes on one of my external drives from them.  Anyone who has spent even 20 minutes cumulatively in their entire life studying this issue knows that Ajit Pai is nothing more than a fucking sock puppet for Verizon and even Comcast, Time Warner, and AT&amp;T to a lesser extent.  The capitalist state, if left unchecked, is nothing more than the executive committee of the ruling class Otherwise known as tyranny Nah at least tyranny is honest in its workings Why don't I ever see protests on front of Google headquarters which lobbied against a "Net Neutrality"-like bill from becoming a law in California? Call or email Congress folks. Fight For The Future and Electronic Frontier Foundation are on the fight.  Make noise positively. Pai and every politician hates it when they can't make the narrative. Does A-Shit-Pie have any friends at all? Jeez that guy better stay indoors. The people have already been ignored and will just be ignored again. The people in charge know what they're doing and don't care how you feel about it.  You can't dismiss on-site Americans as bots or foreign trolls.  We need a law where a person cannot work for a regulatory commision before or after working for the companies they regulate. Lest we forget the stock market crash of 2008. FDA and big pharma. Also the EPA and this less energy dense ethanol blend bullshit. Or the BP oil spill. Jesus.  Then we’d have people with no expertise regulating industries they no nothing about. That would cause all kinds of problems.  And the current system doesnt? Its like hiring El Chapo as the director of the FBI That's fine. We already have civilians running the military. Just look at any subcommittee in Congress. Most members are lawyers and yet subcommittees cover everything.  That law would be struck down as unconstitutional almost immediately.  &gt; We need a law where a person cannot work for a regulatory commision before or after working for the sector they regulate.  The #1 criticism of Betsy DeVos being named Secretary of Education was that she has absolutely zero professional experience in the educational sector. And now you want a law that expands that to the entire government.   So when Randy Babbitt, a 25-year commercial pilot, was named Administrator of the FAA, that was wrong?   Well, I'm sure the IRS will have no trouble finding accountants who have never worked in accounting. The FEC would have to be all minors and non-citizens - people who've never been eligible to vote.   And no one who's ever had a job can be in the Department of Labor, including employees of the Department of Labor! I guess it would be all volunteers and unpaid interns.  Randy babbit was a pilot, not a lawyer for boeing or united airlines, Betsy Devos is just a rich bitch in trumps pocket. I never fleshed out the idea and youre twisting extrapolations to hurt the premise. People with obvious interest conflicts should not be put in regulatory position.  There was ZERO refutation to his point there. Did you even read it? I wasnt trying to refute his point, his point doesnt take away from my point. There should be a law preventing people with previous and future conflicts of interest from gaining employment in regulatory bodies. Doesn't mean we want party shills  or we dont want experienced individuals. You shouldn't go from being a highly paid lawyer for verizon to chairman of the FCC. Just like if Bernie Madoff was chairman of the FDIC. Or if Tony Hayward became chairman of the EPA. Osama Bin Laden became director of the CIA. Or Hillary Clinton became the head of the secret service.....  There's already a lot of this is in place. For example we have financial disclosures that are required. There's insider trading regulations. The issue lies in enforcement, evasion, and exclusions of the law.   Unfortunately, as a rank and file employee of the government there's a lot of regulation in place to check and balance any corruption at my level to keep things copscetic, high ranking officials, they get exclusions, evade applicable regulations, and rarely receive enforcement of applicable laws.  Y'know, if Pai does get assassinated for doing this ballsy stunt and being greedy, I won't really feel that bad. He knew about the outrage, and still did it anyways. It'd be tragedy at its finest. I imagine that will be the only thing that will get their attention. If you pass a law that an overwhelming portion (probably close to 100% assuming people are educated on the matter) of the population disagrees with how can you say you're representing your country?  A person in a federal position literally screwing over every tax paying American for personal profit? I'd say it's treason. How is this any different than say Trump dissolving congress and declaring himself dictator for life? If you willingly sell out your countrymen as a government official the torches should be lit and the pitchforks brought out.  Only when a government fears it's people will true democracy reign. Say what you want about non-violence, it doesn't work. You can't use the legal system against the people who write the laws and pay the cops' salaries. Well said. Never really made that so clear in my mind. Yeah, I'm afraid that if this passes, we'll have to do some illegal stuff to get it back.  Keep in mind, The April poll featured 1/2 a million anti-nn comments by Russian IP-sourced spambots that featured BOTH people that did NOT vote on the poll and dead people's names.  Add in the fact that Ajit stonewalls his replies, and he'll see that, yes, the cornered rat fights back.  Reddit, where being happy about the assassination of someone is upvoted. Upvotes don't exist in real life so yeah this would be the place to go for that type of thing.  I don't understand the benefit of this move. Yeah, Verizon sucks, as does AT&amp;T, Comcast, and pretty much every other telecom, but the individual stores and sales associates have 0 control over the decision. Why not march on the Verizon HQ?  Per [verizonprotests.com](http://verizonprotests.com/), it seems to be about public visibility. They are not attempting to convince Verizon to change its ways. They want to get noticed by Congress and the constituents and influence policy that way.  &gt;WHY VERIZON STORES?    &gt;The new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a former top lawyer for Verizon, and the company has been spending millions on lobbying and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gouge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores, we’re shining light on the corruption and demanding that our lawmakers do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in some cities we'll be protesting right in front of their offices. My concern with this, is because it is in front of a Verizon WIRELESS store (people forget that part), that the passerbys will think you have a beef with Verizon Wireless business practices, which gets a lot of flak and is recognized by FAR more people than Net Neutrality issues.  If you show up holding signs and handing out materials about Net Neutrality and their lobbying efforts, I think you can avoid people getting confused.  If it was just about their reprehensible business practices, then the signs would say so.  Worst cast scenario is someone see the protest, thinks "Huh, Verizon must've done something wrong" and then just moves on with their day. Perfect is the enemy of good here. If you want as many people as possible to participate you can't hold it at a location that's hundreds of miles away for most people.  It's better to have millions protesting across the entire country than to have thousands protesting at a single location.  Here in the Midwest people are trying to organize to March on their HQ  *I guess it's an annex but close enough  To get noticed.   Because there isn't a Verizon HQ in every city Maybe everyone should drop all interwebs and see what happens This isn't going to do shit.  Everyone pig pile the nations capital. &gt; This isn't going to do shit.  why not? people did this same thing to apple stores in france and suddenly apple agree to pay the taxes in ireland. they did not want bad publicity short time before iphone X  when people understand how much more they are they can change EVERYTHING  Lol this will be as effective as occupy...probably the same people too If it passes, is it possible that there will be Internet providers who explicitly say they will not block/limit any websites? Then, everyone will switch to them instead of Verizon or whoever Short answer, no.  Slightly longer answer: ISPs collude with one another because they've done the math and realized that any amount of customers to be gained by encroaching on the turf of a competitor won't outweigh the cost of establishing the infrastructure necessary to do so. This gentlemen's agreement between ISPs means that there won't be innovation sprouting up like flowers in the Spring soil. What it means is that the currently existing monopolies can flex their respective muscles even further to squeeze every penny out of the hostages they have the nerve to call customers. There's not really any additional infrastructure to establish though. Everything would be the same as today.  I'm no expert on the matter, but hasn't AT&amp;T cockblocked Google Fiber in Nashville on the basis that Google would have to use their existing utility poles? It will pass, drop the if. I plan to use a VPN with Microsoft or Amazon. It will be annoying paying another five bucks a mouth but with the new antiprivacy laws passed a few months ago it is probably time to do it. Couldn't ISPs restrict VPN use? If they can block sites or slow down access, I don't see how they can't block VPNs. Good, at least these protestors know who the real enemies of America are. What ever happened to the people protesting at this Pai dickheads house and sending pizzas? that obviously bothered him quite a bit and maybe that's the route everyone has to take. If he wants to sell out all of his fellow citizens he should be out-casted and his family and children should know how much of a piece of shit he is. I would love to see this asshole in his final days full of regret and sorrow when the money doesn't matter anymore and everyone he cares about sees him for the corrupt, failure of a human being he really is.  A mob harassing sales associates in the name of political activism... what could go wrong? And customers too probably. Perfect, harass the low level employees who have nothing to do with it. Whose idea a was it to protest on a weekday afternoon when most people are at work?  I'd imagine this will result in a much, much lower turnout. Where are you getting "afternoon" from? Most of the protests I see are scheduled for early evening, which is when most people get off work. https://events.battleforthenet.com/#eventType=protestrally      Starting from the top:       1 pm   10 am   11 am   4 pm   9 am   12 pm   3 pm   3 pm   5 pm   12 pm   12 am (lol)   9 am   4 pm   10 am      And on and on.  If typical business hours are 8-5, I would say at least 90% of them are taking place during those hours.    I was looking at the ones posted on verizonprotest.com, which shows several in Illinois between 5-7pm, so mileage may vary. It's not like protesters would go *inside* the stores. [Here](https://events.battleforthenet.com/#eventType=protestrally) you can see that nearly all protests take place between 9-5, when a lot of people will be working. Most of them are in the afternoon, including the protests local to me.  This is a huge blunder in my opinion.   Pretty much anyone working a 9-5 job will be absent, so the crowd size won't really be an accurate representation of the opposition.  The cynical side of me wonders if this was intentional. Have you seen the scheduled of protests?  &gt; Whose idea a was it to protest on a weekday afternoon when most people are at work?  The people who don't have a job to worry about. &gt;&gt; Whose idea a was it to protest on a weekday afternoon when most people are at work? &gt; &gt;The people who don't have a job to worry about.  So people who don't matter, got it.  Yeah, I’m sure this will do a lot.  Too bad this won't amount to anything but annoy some employees who have no say in the matter.  Like protests will do shit. Unless a vast majority of American's cancel their internet and cellphone plans and hurt the bottom line of not just Verizon but every ISP (because don't forget, they all benefit) it means nothing. It's not going to happen, I bet not even 5% of people would go a month before re-upping their subscription.  Congress and the executives at Verizon are laughing in their villas sipping the finest of beverages. All bought with money they stole. Well that surely will make a difference!           /s Yelling at commission based retail employees is totally going to fix net neutrality!!  anything that google, reddit, comcast, facebook etc. and all of the other monopolizers are in favor of, im skeptical of Choosing just one store chain does jack otherwise it's like just harassing store clerks of a just one company. So honestly, I don't fully approve. We should instead attack every ISP and mobile provider that has historically had a hostile stance toward net neutrality, not just Verizon. Isn’t there a GoFundMe to raise money for an assassin to kill Pai? I'm sure screaming at a bunch of people just working their retail job will help. Maybe protest at Verizon's corporate offices or at Mr. Pai's house and work? If you really want to get Verizon's attention, switch carriers en masse. Sure, other Telecom companies aren't innocent so this alone is not going to save Net Neutrality, but if this is about protesting one specific company, that would be the best way. Paying $200+ cancellation fee to make a point...lol They’ll just name the next bill “the lovers of the United States support this bill”. Rednecks will lose their mind if they haven’t already over trump endorsing it.  OK, so at the very it least it looks like in the short term we're gonna get fucked for a while. For example, I (like many other people) have contacted my reps and senators about the issue stating that repealing NN only benefits big telecom companies and basically fucks everyone else. So with doing my duty as a US citizen out of the way, what can I do to bypass all this bullshit? What do I look for? I already utilize a VPN service (which I might change for a non US based company, or create my own). Is there anything else that I, and everyone else, can use to free ourselves from this catastrophic shit storm? Well.. you know it's in the Constitution that we can abolish the government if it does something that isn't democratic or just unfair, like repealing net neutrality when everyone wants it to stay. What I mean is that some people's entire lives revolve around the internet, like their work, relationships and their source of entertainment. This would hit those people really hard. I think it would be cool if Ajit Pai was afraid for his safety. Ajit Pai is a piece of shit. Ajit pai needs to die honestly.  Every time Verizon is mentioned my wifes commission check gets a little bit bigger.  Remember the womens march? Asside from solidarity, which is important, what did that accomplish? Not tryimg to be pessemistic. Just realistic. Is it pessemistic to think theyre virtually the same? Or is that just brutal honesty?  Of all the days I pick to transfer from Verizon to t-mobile due to high prices I had to pick today. I guess overall it's a good thing since I can use net neutrality as an excuse for leaving them and hope they don't try to sell me on other plans or some temporary discount bullshit. Yea t-mobile might be just as bad but when you need reliable service for work stuff you gotta just go with the lesser evil I guess. When are we the people going to stand up and march on the FCC headquarters and force the issue.  There are over 400 million of us.  How have we been made so weak and complacent  We'll give you internet on Tuesday, for your liberties today. Why Verizon? Why not outside the FCC? They're not going to protest online?  Remember when major sites went dark over PIPA and SOPA? What happened between then and now? The most any site is doing is only discussing NN or changed their logo to a slowed down version.
 Is the assault alleged, or is he the alleged perpetrator of the assault? Those are very different things.  Sounds like the assault is not "alleged". It clearly happened. He is the *alleged attacker*.  Really poor editing on the CBC's part, says I. it's an alleged attack until proven in a court of law, so the title is correct. It's ALSO true that he is the alleged attacker, but the two are not mutually exclusive, so the title is still correct since it makes no reference to "alleged attacker" at all. Instead, it accurately identifies that the man has been charged for an alleged assault. Hmmm... This may be a legal vs. common language issue.  With 25 witnesses, there's no question that the event happened. Whether a court defines it as "assault" and whether the suspect is legally responsible, are issues for the court.  Does this square our perspectives? &gt;"He tried to grab my head and force it onto his crotch," she said. "He tried to grab me by my headscarf."  &gt;Fadel said she attempted to move out of the way and put her hands up to defend herself. She couldn't reach the emergency help button and none of the passengers helped, she said.  And this, ladies and gentlemen, is the psychology of distributed responsibility of crowds. But i can't help but imagine that an additional bias against Muslims was at play.  No one intervened until he hit her in the face. And even so, only one guy did so.  Those people were disgusting to watch all this unfold without even lifting a finger or raising their voice.  Agreed this is disgusting. More people should have stood up for the poor girl. Was happy to read this afterwards. http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/why-a-lone-good-samaritan-stepped-up-in-a-vancouver-attack-on-muslim-teen/  Edit: should of to should have. From the Macleans article:  &gt;(Noor) Almost every other day I get verbally assaulted and it hurts every single time—at my workplace, at my school, in everyday life.  ...wtf is wrong with people??      Some don't realize we are all human beings. It's disgusting but unfortunately it is the world we live in.  *should have  If it's so dangerous for Muslims, maybe they should find refuge in a safer country. I hear Saudi Arabia is pretty Muslim-friendly, she should move there.  If you're Sunni. Shia should probably look towards Iraq or Iran.
 Good to see Florida man finally got a job. Hope this turns his life around Before what, the the mid 20 meth years strike? Silly you. Meth begins as a Florida Sperm.  Did he also reveal how he hacked? If so wouldn't that just be a really good bug bounty pay out? If I am understanding correctly, the current CEO believes the previous CEO may have paid hackers to "destroy" the data that was stolen through a breach, and did it through a bounty bug payment to cover it up and make it look like they provided a legitimate service, when that would have actually been blackmail. The CEO is saying it was an incident that should have been reported to regulators, which makes it sound like it could be more than just a bug bounty.  I'm not saying if it happened one way or the other, I just believe that is what the current CEO is getting at. It is also important to note that it is honestly in the current CEO's best interest to have remained quiet about the incident if regulators did not pick up on it. Episode 111 of Reply All podcast just explained the ransom turned bug bounty situation.  https://play.google.com/music/m/Dudlcl7v6mupawtbawpv3xj6veu?t=111_Return_of_the_Russian_Passenger_-_Reply_All Florida Man, Florida Man, blowing the whistle while extorting man.  Look Out! Here comes the Florida Man. Florida man, Florida man, Hit on the head with a frying pan, Lives his life in a garbage can, Florida man. Florida man, Florida Man, Florida Man hates Universal Healthcare Man, prefers to be financially raped by Private HealthCare Man, Florida Man, Florida Man... they have a fight, florida man wins [and eats triangle man's face], florida man Florida Man strikes again! It's like Uber is run by Dr. Evil's smart by fuckup son Scott. Great to see Florida man finally having some success!! [](/starlightwat)Florida Man is like Bizarro Barbie with all the different jobs you can find him in, only it's usually sad, illegal and awful. Apparently not enough. Looks like he didn't do what he was paid to! I am actually glad this was a Floridaman. The identity of this hacker needs to be release and he needs to be sued under the Florida CADRA act. Specifically:  &gt; 668.803 Prohibited acts.—A person who knowingly and with intent to cause harm or loss: &gt;(1) Obtains information from a protected computer without authorization and, as a result, causes harm or loss; &gt;(2) Causes the transmission of a program, code, or command to a protected computer without authorization and, as a result of the transmission, causes harm or loss; or &gt;(3) Traffics in any technological access barrier through which access to a protected computer may be obtained without authorization, is liable to the extent provided in s. 668.804 in a civil action to the owner, operator, or lessee of the protected computer, or the owner of information stored in the protected computer who uses the information in connection with the operation of a business.  His hacker would be liable not only to uber under section 1/2 but also to individual record holders (all 57 million of them) under section 3.   Just for completeness of this comment here is what the civil remedies are:  &gt; 668.804 Remedies.— &gt;(1) A person who brings a civil action for a violation under s. 668.803 may: &gt;(a) Recover actual damages, including the person’s lost profits and economic damages. &gt;(b) Recover the violator’s profits that are not included in the computation of actual damages under paragraph (a). &gt;(c) Obtain injunctive or other equitable relief from the court to prevent a future violation of s. 668.803. &gt;(d) Recover the misappropriated information, program, or code, and all copies thereof, that are subject to the violation. &gt;(2) A court shall award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party in any action arising under this part. &gt;(3) The remedies available for a violation of s. 668.803 are in addition to remedies otherwise available for the same conduct under federal or state law. &gt;(4) A final judgment or decree in favor of the state in any criminal proceeding under chapter 815 shall estop the defendant in any subsequent action brought pursuant to s. 668.803 as to all matters as to which the judgment or decree would be an estoppel as if the plaintiff had been a party in the previous criminal action. &gt;(5) A civil action filed under s. 668.803 must be commenced within 3 years after the violation occurred or within 3 years after the violation was discovered or should have been discovered with due diligence.  As an additional matter, the “hacker” can face criminal charges under section 815.06 Florida Statutes, likely as a second degree felony. Someone needs to get repeatedly kicked in the tits over this. sounds like it was a big bounty and not paying him for silence Probably a little of both, thats a ton of cash for a bug bounty.
 Nothing like cracking open a cold one after a long day of work. Probably one the darkest jokes I’ve ever laughed at. Good one  lol that one isn't that dark  there are far darker jokes But was it with the boys tho? A good stiff one deserves another Without the internet, I couldn't hear about stuff like this while I take shits at work.   What a glorious invention  Ahh, Willirico on the front page. Refreshing.    Just another day in paradise/Heroin Town USA.    &gt; Aaron stated he knew the victim hated having sex with him so he figured that the victim might wake up if he had sex with her.   You don’t say...     Edit: oh, he has a go fund me for her funeral/drug money. Lovely. No money raised yet though.  I grew up in Tolland. Haven't heard the term Willirico in years. Got a little bit of a chuckle out of that. Thanks. I grew up in good ole willarico glad to see it hasn’t changed. Also from Willimantic, heyo I live there now, its definitely an interesting place. Grew up there in the early 90s and it was full of heroin then I can only imagine what it’s like now We’re the heroin hipsters. We had it before it was cool/a result of overprescribing.  at least Willibrew is good &gt;Ahh, Willirico on the front page. Refreshing.   I know someone's a local when they use the term "Willirico" He coulda just married my ex-wife She hated having sex with him, so he had sex with her in an attempt to revive her from an overdose?     Junkie-logic... Sounds like rape, 1st degree to me That and man slaughter. Except the autopsy showed she was already dead - had no blood flow - when he has sex with her. I’m guessing hashtag metoo would be inappropriate. Depends, is zombie a protected group? Only in California and parts of New York especially since it can be read (#pound)metoo I live in Willimantic, this is crazy! Its pretty obvious there is a drug problem. There are plenty of junkies just walking around high as a kite.  On a plus side, I haven't seen as much prostitution lately. Man am i glad i dont like heroine. Or dead people.   Too much reddit today.  That judge has a sense of humor: "[he] was spared placement on the state’s sex offender registry after the judge found “registration is not required for public safety based upon the facts in this case.”' I dont know how to feel about that.  Don’t be so rigid I agree. This creep avoids the sex registry but 2 teens who sext each other are branded for life. Silly nonsense Maybe we should ensure that they also avoid it rather than expanding a shitty system? He didn't have sex with a dead woman.  He had sex with a woman who laid dying.  If anything his actions killed her.  He currently didn't do anything to save her.  Just a year and not being registered as a sex offender.  Justice in this country seems to be a spin of the wheel.  This guy should be charged with man slaughter and registered.   She was dead. Read the article.  How do you think I know she was still breathing,  You should read the article and then read it again.     Your comprehension seems low.    “Aaron stated he listened to see if the victim was breathing and he heard gurgling. Aaron stated he knew the victim hated having sex with him so he figured that the victim might wake up if he had sex with her.” Because later on in the article:  &gt;"As for the gurgling Graser said he heard, that could have been decomposition gases escaping the woman’s body, an investigator from the medical examiner’s office told police."  Their reasoning is stupid, "no bruising" so she must have been dead. Most sex doesn't result in bruising. In any case, dead or alive he should be registered.  He tied her to the bed for Pete sakes.  There was no bruising where she was tied up meaning her blood was not flowing There would only be bruising if she was fighting.  It's stupid logic.  Determining time of death is not such a finite thing to tell.  Whatever the case the guy still thought he was bounding and raping an unconscious woman. I am sorry but I am trusting the doctors opinion that there would be blood under the skin. Fighting or not if you tie someone up tightly there is bruising at the site. Now this isn't a defense of what he did but I think they know what they are talking about. Maybe you can make the argument that the fentanyl slowed her heart too much for the blood to pool. [deleted] There is no way you can tie someone tight and not leave a mark  Edit: and paramedics don't do autopsies shoulda wrote finish the article. my bad.  Where were all these women when I was still working in the morgue? Okay, but was she hot?  Dead cold, actually. 'She's as cold as ice'..... Not to say that what he did isn't disgusting, but as a woman who has to regularly engage in "abortion is (not) a murder" debate, I have a problem with calling a mindless lump of cells a "victim" of "sexual assault". Especially considering that it would've been perfectly legal for him to put up her taxidermied naked body on display in a museum. She wasn't dead when he started raping her.    “Aaron stated he listened to see if the victim was breathing and he heard gurgling."    So, then. A rapist and a murderer... According to the ME, she was already dead, and the gurgling was likely just gasses escaping the body.  But as for intent, he didn't have the intent to sleep with a dead woman.  Hell, he was trying to save her....He rapes to save! He tied her to the bed Dave.  Probably not the first time he's tied her to the bed and raped her. Would you like to see your recently deceased family member fucked? Probably not.  Of course I wouldn't. I also wouldn't want to see my recently deceased family member's naked taxidermied body put on display in a museum. And my family will never allow my organs to be donated after my death.  I just find it interesting that a dead human body is legally a person and not a person, depending on circumstances. Your family should allow your organs to be donated unless they wouldn't ever accept a donated organ themselves They should. But they won't. If you're in the USA it's not up to them, it's your choice legally I'm not. If they have no family, a document alone is binding, but if the healthcare proxy (which if not listed defaults to various family members in a specific order in NY) does not want to donate the organs, they will not harvest them.   Living people trump documents as a rule. Abortion is a bit different, plus you don't have sex with it after. Its quite a bnit different. I dare you to explain that difference to a pro-lifer.  ...unless you are a pro-lifer and you think fetuses deserve more rights than corpses. I've met some who do. Nah, I have enough to deal with than someone like that. Them, anti vaccination people and flat earth people are so stuck in their little bubbles they can't see anyone elses view point. Especially not a woman's. Well, this woman thinks unthinking, unfeeling lumps of cells aren't people, even if at some other point in time they might have been/will be people. Eh, maybe. Fucking either a fetus or dead body is still fucked up. I never said it wasn't. Interesting point. The same logic should apply here You can only do that with permission from the family though.  Abuse of a corpse is a crime because it victimizes the family.  Yeah I know that. That's why I said what he did was disgusting. I'm reminded of Alice Cooper's seminal (heh) rock hit from the early 1970s, *Cold Ethyl.* Why no pictures of the dead woman?  Was she at least hot? Doesn't matter. He's probably one of those guys who'll go after anything with a hole and a heartbeat. Except in this case, his standards weren't quite that high. Probably room temperature. Well, she was a junkie from Willimantic who was dating that guy...you do the math. she got Expired? like some kind of food storage, a chillin feelin got me there
 Isn't it already going to be legal January 1st in the whole state? The law still allows individual cities to choose whether they want to allow sales within their borders, so this is LA choosing how they will go about allowing sales LA was always going to allow it...this article (sentence) lol I'd like to officially propose the term for the pot equivalent of "dry" (as in, a "dry county" being one where you can't buy alcohol) to be "uptight." Is SD good? California... knows how to party. In the city... city of LA. Jesus this is all so fucked. Yeah, screw letting individual communities determine how they want to be governed! Except it’s illegal federally, legal in some states, not legal to carry to another state, not legal to sell in some places in the state, legal to grow plants for personal use in some states and not others, it’s largely cash only because of the problems with legality, etc... Yeah, as much as I support individual state and community action, there needs to be common-sense federal action on rescheduling. which won't happen until an FDA trial which takes 5-7 years, Thanks to the DEA for that bullshit. It's why MDMA will be rescheduled before Cannabis. It is being researched to great effect iirc but one leads to the other, so what's the problem? But people can still grow their own plants for individual use.  Nothing really changes, it's just all out in the open now.  The people that consumed now have a safe place in which to buy and the citizens reap the social and tax revenue benefits.   It's been legal since the day after the vote (November 8th 2016).  They left out the word sales, which start January 1st 2018.  Local municipalities can allow, regulate or ban sales.  So it wasn't a given that it would be legal to sell in LA on January 1st. &gt; So it wasn't a given that it would be legal to sell in LA on January 1st.  LA is currently the largest cannabis market in the world. There is no way they were going to ban weed, so, yes, it was a "given" that it would be legal in LA.    Source- Have sold many thousands of pounds of weed to dispensaries in LA...oh, sorry, I meant "donated". CA here. Weed, would be "legal" statewide, but cities and counties can choose not to sell it within their borders if they wish. Many counties are choosing to cash in on the tax $$$$. LA is simply the largest city so far in the state to give a thumbs up. I don't smoke so it does not affect me anyways, but I like examining the laws. Lets be honest though,  the entire LA area (nix parts of the OC) and the entire Bay Area will legalize. Kern county just a couple hours north of LA has voted to ban sales along with most of the cities in the county. The rest just haven't voted yet. Keep in mind this is the council's voting and not the public. of course Kern county wouldnt legalize - they earn all the revenue they need by handing out $500 speeding tickets on I5!  But really, tha county is veryg red, not surprising at all.  And its not considered a part of the LA Metro or greater LAarea.   Correct. It is very unfortunate considering that we need the tax revenue pretty damn bad. Is there a list somewhere that I can check which counties/cites and banning selling? kern county is a shithole though.  I think the only OC city to allow it so far has been Santa Ana.  Anaheim doesn't allow but doesn't enforce either. They know where the shops are and leave them alone so far  ... this is about recreational sales not medical sales.   they won't be allowing the recreational sale in anaheim... the medical shops can keep doing what they've been doing.  Anaheim does not allow marijuana shops of any variety in their town.  That being said, there are over 100 at any given time.   Is there a list somewhere?  We'll see how long legal sales last though, we've decided we needed a 45% tax on sales.  and a ban of any edible over 100 mg TOTAL package size, with a 10 mg max dose. its like they don't even care what we need.  Oregon checking in. We have a high tax as well but legality has led to retail prices low enough that it’s not unreasonable.      Plus, one of the bigselling points pro-legalization folks have used is tax revenue. It irks me to hear of the same people complaining about paying the tax now that they got what they asked for. OC is fiscally conservative, but not necessarily "morally" or socially so. If the white middle class people there would bother to vote or even have an informed opinion, I think it would easily pass. &gt; LA is simply the largest city so far in the state  The geographer in me has to comment: it will remain that way as it's the largest city in the state, period. It was made legal *last* January 1st to have up to an ounce on you for personal use, in your own home.  There has yet to be any licenses issued for *sales* though, so basically, you could grow it yourself and smoke up all you want, but couldn't (legally) purchase it anywhere. Legally. not true, you can legally purchase at most shops if you are over 21 right now. 18 with a medical rec. some shops have chosen to wait until Jan 1st to open up to rec sales, but most in my area are open for it.  Uh, no, that's not legal.   You can probably purchase, but not legally. That wouldn't surprise me. But they don't have a license to sell for recreation purposes.  Not many shops have licenses. Anaheim technically bans all pot shops, but there are over 100 active shops that have signs and fully advertise what they are. Full compliance shops are rare and there doesn't seem to be much enforcement at the moment. That is supposed to change in Jan but i really don't see that happening.  &gt; Full compliance shops are rare and there doesn't seem to be much enforcement at the moment.   I get it. I'm saying that's still *not legal*. Just because it's not enforced doesn't make it legal. Enjoy it while you can, because when they do start issuing licenses, they will crack down on those shops. Just like you can't open a public bar in your garage by just buying liquor and offering it for sale. right, cuz medical licensing is so strictly enforced and monitored.  i'm not worried  I never said you ought to be worried, I was saying you were wrong in calling those legal dispensaries. They are not. &gt;Not many shops have licenses.  No one has a license to sell now. the licenses don't take effect until Jan 1st... even the ones already issued to people getting ready to sell recreationally.   if they're doing it its illegal.  &gt;some shops have chosen to wait until Jan 1st to open up to rec sales, but most in my area are open for it.  then they're doing it illegally...   the licenses that are being issued don't take effect until Jan1st.   everyone buying now should still have a rec.  &gt;There has yet to be any licenses issued for sales though,   that's actually not true. they started issueing them I think. they don't go into effect on the 1st though. 6am is when they can open.   these are also temporary 90-120 licenses if I recall so they can be up and running day 1 if their city allows it. the thing holding back the permits was whether the city would allow it and since LA just passed their rules shops here can probably get their permits now.  If its accepted in your city there will be shops who have temporary recreational licenses on January 1st ready for you to buy if you're 21+.    Maybe they had some local regulations in place? That, and there were already a few shops in LA that would sell it to anyone. all these places..... are so far away.   Why cant a place like..... near tampa have this.....  Because of old people So you’re telling me it’s going to be even more smokey here in a few weeks? Blaze it The bushs in thehills around you know whats up That was the shortest article I've ever seen.  I love that I didn't have to scan through 5 paragraphs before I actually found out what the news was.  What's going to be interesting here is second wave - what are these shops going to look like, and what additional CPG items, are they going to be retailing? How's the Amsterdam pot cafe model going to line up to what American's want? There's so much money to be made here, and someone's gotta set the tone for what a legal, approachable weed spot should look like in the US. I mean -  teppanyaki? Grab-n-go. Orrich french  saucy dishes full of dank at fancy spots?  I'm thinking hookah lounge, just without that much body hair and Iran's Hot 100 hits. I want to open a movie theater with the comfiest lazyboy chairs, lots of snacks, and a great ventilation system that you can smoke in. That's my dream for legalization No way are they going to allow smoking indoors of public businesses.  Haha you're gonna have to hire people to waoe up your customers when the movie ends Well there are already plenty of examples in the US with CO, WA and OR. Assuming LA doesn't burn to the ground... Id just like to see LA focus on having less people in it Not gonna happen God I hate this attitude. "LA was full the moment I got here/ was born here. No one else should come here now."   What makes you being here OK and not someone else? People have been flocking to LA for a long long time and that's not going to change any time soon. But, hey, you're free to leave, that wouldmake the city have less people in it. I guess he doesn't understand the concept of a city. Idk, I also live 2500 miles from there soooooo calm down? Weed lowers fertility, and smoking it is carcinogenic, so there’s your silver lining I guess  Fertility related problems reverse when the subject stops smoking for a period longer than 20 days and its related to the testosterone decrease. Tobacco is 10fold as carcinogenic (due to the amount per day that tobacco smokers smoke compared to marijuana smokers) and is legal. Weed smokers can vape THC if concerned about their health. THC also reduces the binding of carcinogenic alive cells that bind, making some types of cancer less frecuent amongst users, as a study from the Unicersity of Barcelona reveals. Also, taxes man, weed raises money for the people if legalized, if not, it does for the dealers. That towns already blazing. Hey, I'm from Argentina and I'll be going to LA in January, what should I expect regarding pot vendors? Weed has been effectively decriminalized for years in California. I've felt safe from the cops walking down the street with a joint in hand for a long time.   Black Market dealers can still get in trouble if they're stupid, and now they'll get in trouble for tax evasion if they continue.  But you can believe that they will pay those taxes. The more taxes they pay, the more money they're making.  As it is now, until January you can't go into a dispensary without a medical prescription. It is very easy to get a medical prescription. That is the only obstacle to getting high right now and that is going away.   A lot of people still go to their local dealer because it's just easier sometimes. Thanks for the insight, my man.   Yeah, I've been there in september, and I could only buy weed via friends that had that medical prescription. I really want to go by myself to the dispensary this time. The dispensaries are usually really nice. People are friendly and willing to help. Jars of all the dankest weed around. Each labeled with THC content and strain. It’s like going in a candy store and picking your flavors. Usually you’ll find they are pretty clean, and smell like mounds of lush kush.  Honestly just walk around and ask someone. Last time I was in Cali literally just went to the beach and asked this guy painting aliens if he had a hookup. But on January first, you can go into a store and buy it? you already can, but yes more stores on Jan 1 You can buy recreational weed at the moment? I was just out there and the google told me they were all medical until January. you can get a medical card for a stubbed toe basically.  It is more of a formality than anything else.   But you need to live in Ca to get one. Yup, just purchased last night.  You cannot buy weed without a medical license until January 1st, and even then it's on a city-by-city basis. Every city needs to form their own rules about where the dispensaries can be located and how they're going to go about collecting taxes. Remember, it is still illegal under federal law and the banks won't work with the dispensaries. Taxes must be paid in cash, probably with armored cars. So in LA, in January first, will recreational be accessible?  It already is accessible as recreational use. Just call the store you plan on visiting and ask if they take only medical card users or if they also allow 21+ recreational users. Oh shit you can just call!?! I thought they were just being cool  No medical card here and I've bought cannabis from multiple stores already in the OC and LA area. Some stores already allows the sale of cannabis if you're 21+ The more you spend the more you save! Its pretty great, if you've never gone to a store before.  10-30+ strains to choose from and hundreds of concentrates, edibles, etc.  Other things:  Taking weed across state borders is illegal.  Even though weed is legal in Nevada and Oregon, carrying it across statd borders is still a crime.  Granted, the chances of being caught are tiny (would require a US federal policeman to stop you), which is pretty unheard of unless its a DEA sting or something (you never know with our current Attorney General).   Public smoking is still looked down on in many areas (and is technically illegal) and I wouldnt advise it unless you know the area.  Also, smoking weed is way more tolerated and more mainstream in SF/Oakland than in Socal; if you get the chance to venture up that way.  But the weed is just as good in both :)  Enjoy your trip to LA! Great question.  I'm going in February to Orange/Anaheim/Redondo.  Would these legal sales only be for California residents?   When I travelled to Colorado from out of state, I was capable of walking into a dispensary with proper age verification. I'm fairly certain that marijuana tourism will be a thing for California as well. No I think you just need age verification. And don't travel with it across the state borders. Yep, this is a big thing for non-Americans to know. Travel over a state border and you can get nailed with drug charges, technically even going to another legal state too if they both share a land border. And don't go through a border patrol checkpoint. They'll write you a ticket. For anyone 21+ No, but not sure if Orange county has made laws about permitting etc yet. They are typically more conservative than Los Angeles so you might have to drive up to LA to actually purchase. But you can have it on you wherever dont spread misinformation. OC and SD have thriving pot communities. Anaheim alone had over 143 shops at one point.   No one is spreading misinformation. It took them much longer to figure out medical marijuana. It will probably take them longer than LA to figure out recreational. Which it already has since LA now has laws and processes in place..   I know it might not seem that way if you haven't been around since the beginning of medical marijuana, but it is I have been actually. I remember having to drive hours to find a doc. Now i get it done via fax. OC and SD have medical and recreational laws in place. We're not LA's backward cousin  Probably that they will be on fire. Eh since it's so soon your options will be limited, but there are well funded businesses that will be up and running early January I'm sure.   It's been pretty much legal for so long here that anyone who smokes just has a rec.   Since this vote just happened it will take a while for everything to be up and running full speed, but there will be people with lots of money and experience ready to pounce. I'd expect at least 1-2 recreational places per part of la to be open early January though I was under the impression that it was already legal to buy pot recreationally. I travelled out to LA 2 weeks ago and bought edibles from a dispensary in San Bernardino County. Everything looked legit, they just had me fill out some paperwork in the lobby. After i finished they let me into another part of the building where i was free to buy weed and edibles. That paperwork probably said you were a legal medical patient under penalty of perjury. If anyone did sign that, it would be wise of them to not leave behind any fingerprints They need to sell it now. Those wild fires blazing will allow users to save on lighters. LITERALLY turn the whole town into a HOT BOX’. 'Hold my mint julep!"  \-\- Jeff Sessions, probably But, good people don't smoke marijuana! This article was one sentence. What a bunch of bullshit. Pot is truly a wonder drug with no negative effects. Don't they have enough smoke in the air already? :-( Hey, that's pretty good. Leave Denver and go there, everyone who hasn't lived here for the past ten years. Where do you think all these Californians come from in the first place? They come from all the other states. That's why we have so many people. Stop complaining about your wonderful State being crowded. Nobody cares when Californians do it and we've had the most practice at it. Yep, as a nat. born Californian I laugh when people bitch about us "invading" other states, when a good portion of people living here were not even born here. They exhaust the resources until everywhere is a mirror of LA County, similar to locusts, then expand to the next livable area. Haha exactly. I rented a room in LA from a guy from Boston when first out of college. He thought it was weird that all of my friends and me were from California. He didn’t know anyone who wasn’t from out of state! Or you can go fuck yourself because I've lived my entire adult life here. You are what makes the state shitty, not transplants. Colorado is a freaking state of transplants going back to its beginnings. There's no Old Money here or some shit like that. Just cause you moved here in 2000 or 1990 or 1920 doesn't mean you are more a Coloradan than someone that moved here last week. Get over yourself (and please, if you have one of those Native stickers, kick yourself in the ass for me because you look like an idiot).  Fuck off, triggered fuck. I'm done giving a shit about whether or not traffic is getting worse and if rent is going up. So fucking annoying. Wahhh my state doesn't have legal weed so I'll just move to Colorado wahhh. Get over myself? Sorry bud, but I already consider myself to be trhe lowest piece of scum to ever exist on the face of this planet. Why did you even decide to pay ant attention to what I wrote? You should have obviously been able to tell that its nothing more than a senseless shitpost. And I'm not what makes Colorado shitty, I'm just some guy on the internet. Y'all are the ones clogging the streets and driving up rent. You lived here your entire adult life yeah? Then depending on how old you are, I have no quarrel with you. But fuck it. No more shits from this guy. Nope. Ajit Pai can rip Net Neutrality away from everyone I don't care. I've even seen arguments from citizens supporting the repealing of net neutrality so you know what I think? I will always be wrong. I will only ever be a worthless piece of trash, undeserving of the air he breathes. Good, if you stopped giving a shit, then shut the fuck up and stop complaining. Also, by the fact that you started ranting about completely unrelated topics, I'm going to assume (or hope) you're drunk. You okay? It's only 1:30... Not drunk, just got off work. I'm never ok, but it doesn't matter. Have a good one.  So...this time the smog will give you a contact high? Nations largest city to become nations largest city? LA isn't the largest city You are correct! The largest city in the US is Sitka, Alaska. Los Angeles is #12. Correct.  Sometimes people say Jacksonville, FL, but that's the largest in the lower 48.   Isn't Los Angeles the Nation's largest city as it is?  Why not say, the nation's largest city with a hotdog stand in it?  The largest city where a hooker can go bowling? The largest city that has a bodega in it? Please don’t breed. Have you never heard of New York City? I grew up there... they held LA over our heads every day... more spread out, hence "largest"... didn't matter we had more people, they were the largest city. LA is full of stoned and homeless - its like the walking dead I can't wait for all of our bums to leave and go to LA where they belong... 2018 will be a great year.  They're not legalizing meth. Meth is already legal. With a prescription. But I enjoyed your snarky comment non the less. 😉 When are you setting off for LA? I always love how people look down on California As a bunch of lazy pot smoking hippies.  Meanwhile large industries that have powered wealth across the country was born and built up here.  The internet wouldn't exist without what was done by Californians lazy jobless stoners and rich coastal elites all at once...whichever one is convenient in the argument at hand! /s We have our fair share of bums in British Columbia, but a lot of respectable citizens are using pot for medicinal purposes here.

 Is this fake news...or not? Trump fans, a little help? You guys said this number was a lie under obama, is it still a lie? Lol Not a Trumpster, but independent.    Consumer confidence is at its highest point in 17 years.    https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-31/u-s-consumer-confidence-index-rises-to-highest-level-since-2000    The "real news" number is the U6 figure, which is TOTAL unemployed. That number is dropping as well.   https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm    My opinion. Through Obama's presidency, his administration gets the credit for clawing us out of the worst recession in history.    Any Trump effect now is primarily due to reactionary market forces maintaining momentum of an inevitable cyclical upswing, even if Trump can exit a two-term presidency without crashing the economy, he'll still get blamed for the next recession much like Bush is often blamed for the 2008 recession which Obama inherited. The right blames Obama for 2008, the left blames Bush, in reality it was cyclical market forces exacerbated by sub-prime mortgage markets due to easy money and unconventional lending practices.    Trump is making all of the right moves to maintain an economic upswing, however the Fed is also going to do its own thing regardless and raise rates to buffer for the next downturn despite very low inflation, so it'll be interesting to see how this works out.     Given the reactionary nature of the Dow right now, it is the best indicator of Trumps economic success, as you'll notice that markets plunge on any negative political news coming out of the white house, while it skyrockets on "positive" news like the tax bill.     The tax bill in my opinion will not raise incomes across the board, but it will stimulate the economy by driving investment, which in turn usually turns into more jobs.     There are two types of investors, ones that water at the mouth for easy returns and dividends, and ones that would rather see a company reinvest profits to grow the stock price sustainably. There are more of the good kind when all economic factors are up, because there is less fear of having to cut out before a major crash. If this keeps up, we're in for a pretty great ride over the next ten years or so, despite the naysayers.     The people predicting a massive market crash a la 2008 are about as correct as the people saying that Trumps presidency mirrors Hitlers. Minor associations to the two when there are a ton of missing factors driving a crash like there was in 2008.    While I agree that the tax plan will be great for the stock market (decreased corporate taxes equals increased profits, especially when you're nearly halving the rate), I doubt it will lead to a significant increase in jobs.  Demand forces are historically the only thing that drive up jobs, not the money supply, especially when loans are so cheap with the low fed rates.  Instead this will boom the stock market, and people at the top will pocket a lot of green.  They tried tax amnesty to repatriate money during the GW Bush administration and hiring / pay didn't go up for the middle/lower classes.  Companies instead engaged in stock buybacks and executive bonuses which only helps inflate the stock market.  If they really wanted to spur more jobs, they'd significantly cut taxes on the lower brackets instead of the higher ones.  Poor and middle class spend more of their money, so more money goes into buying products and services rather than mostly entering the investment pool like it typically does with the super rich.  Companies are forced to hire more people and expand to meet demand.  I feel then argument that companies making record profits and the upper class that are richer than almost any point in history need a huge tax break to trickle down on us is absurd and insulting to anyone with critical thinking skills at this point. You say the economy is fine. Why are interest rates still so low?  Shell-shock from the last recession. The Fed will be raising rates systematically over the next year or so, but no one wanted to raise them until they were absolutely positive the market could sustain it, in my opinion.    The fact that they are going to raise rates even though inflation figures don't necessarily warrant it, is especially encouraging as it could possibly put us in a much stronger position when the next recession hits. It means that the Fed is seeing the economy as exceptionally strong in that it can absorb the reduction of quantitative easing, not only as a reaction to the current market necessarily, but also in preparation for the future.  All my opinion, but there it is.  Its hard not to see a crash, the market has been heading that way anyways. This bill does nothing but make it worse. Employment is up, but wages remain stagnant. The housing market is exclusively reacting to the renter's market becoming SO inflated, and the removal of the property tax deduction is going to KILL the housing market in the NE, California, and the  Pacific NW, the economic backbone of the country. This bill alone, and the amount of underwater home owners the property tax adjustment could cause, is more than enough to torpedo the still tepid, but recovering housing marke.t HOPEFULLY the fed raises interest rates, otherwise they will have literally NO wiggle room to mitigate another crash, but this will effectively negate a large portion of the supposed trickle down effect of this legislation.  Jobless claims fall around the holidays, always.  But the economy has undeniably accelerated, considering Q3 GDP was at 3.9% Not a fan, but people forget that there are large numbers of unemployed that fall off the "jobless claims" numbers. THAT number is rising. You want to look at the total number of unemployed people, whether filing for unemployment or not. The U-6 measure is down, and is actually at its lowest point in over a decade. Right now, it's at 7.9%.  1. The government unemployment numbers include people who are not on unemployment.   2. These are initial jobless claims. People falling off unemployment wouldn't effect this number. The BLS unemployment report that comes out tomorrow is the important one, but this is a good sign. It's still rising? so unemployment Is even worse now than it was under obama?  That's the only way to read it. Thanks trump.  Everyone is giving up. 1/5 adult males today are jobless. Society is so busy caring about women in stem that they don't give a shit about the people who're actually suffering in today's economy. [deleted] Considering zero economic policies from this Congress have kicked in, no, it probably has very little to do with this Congress or the president. Probably thanks to the previous president. Obamas economy kicking in. Trump comes in and kills all of Obama's regulations/bullshit and the economy soars. Liberals response, obviously this is because of Obama. If by "soars" you means "grows at about the rate it has the past 4 years," sure, it "soared." What do you mean? This year was the first time it maintained a steady growth over 1%. How the fuck isn't that soared? Because you measure it year over year, not by how steady it is. The most optimistic projections put annual growth .3% over 2015 numbers. That's not insubstantial, but it's not "soared." Economic growth is at 3.1 (that's realistic which is already over .3%), last year it was 1.6. Year before it was 2.6 which was Obama's record high. So from 1.6 to 3.1, it has "soared". What regulations has he killed?  Here's a [list](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-administration-cancels-hundreds-of-obama-era-regulations/2017/07/20/55f501cc-6d68-11e7-96ab-5f38140b38cc_story.html?utm_term=.0cbfac3a3423) Did you read this? He has scrapped planned regulations that never went into effect, but he hasn't killed any that are already established.  No, that was when they laid out the plan for the regulations he was going to kill, which he did. That was back in July. Stock market is now reflecting it.
 Was it a pinky swear? Because those are Rock solid  As long as they promise.. It is crazy how much plastic ends up in the ocean. Are countries just dumping it in there directly? Is it barges losing it? I am really dumb as to the reasons so much ends up there. It's about time someone stopped that wasteful ocean But the million dollar question is...are any of those 200 the ones actually causing the problem? Start at home. Stop buying plastic
 TripAdvisor's response misses the point: consumers aren't worried about showing up to fake restaurants so much as relying on a system that is so easily manipulated and faked. I've eaten in London.  That's not much of a trick. I've never ended up eating in some guys shack, I have followed reviews that led to some pretty horrific shit holes.  For some odd reason, my authentic reviews never seem to show up... There has got to be a better way! This summer at Joe's Crap Shack dive head first into a bucket of flange. 
 ...People put out Christmas gifts this far from Christmas? Yes, esp if you have kids. Gives them lots of time to ooo and ahh and get excited over presents. It’s easier to wrap them than hide them Why does it matter? Most people put Christmas gift under the tree weeks before Christmas.  She must have really liked opening gifts. Its nice to see Margot Kidder landed on her feet That's just because another family was in her house taking her presents. 
 ...an ironic consequence of their high efficiency. I renovated my house and put in all LEDs everywhere.  The electric bill is cheaper, but the lack of heat is noticeable.  A desk lamp used to be able to somewhat warm up a bedroom if the door was closed. Yep the primary source of light in my living room is four giant standing lamps. Switched over to LED's in the summer which was nice, but come winter I noticed big time. Are you serious that seems crazy to me. Lights and lamps really produce that much heat? Almost all the energy used by traditional filament bulbs is emitted as heat, not light.  IIRC, they have something like 10% efficiency at converting electricity to light. Worse than that. [Typically less than 5% light:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb?wprov=sfla1) [Here’s a generic LED bulb that is equivalent in brightness to a 60-watt LED](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00BXBGG76). Note that this bulb actually uses only 10 watts of energy, despite putting out the same amount of energy in light (which brightness is a measure of). This means that 50 watts of pure heat generation were saved.  For reference, the toaster oven sitting in my kitchen puts out a maximum of 1000 watts, and that’s at its burn-food-to-a-crisp setting. That means that, by replacing 20 normal light bulbs with LEDs, over the course of about 15 minutes I’ve saved enough energy to blacken a few slices of pizza. Just imagine what that can do over the course of a year, and then if every house in your city did the same thing. That’s a lot of energy saved.  (I realize I’m playing fast and loose with efficiencies and things here, but the general idea remains the same) Probably better idea is that a small space heater can use around 1500 watts  I use an old HP server. Works like a charm! I mine buttcoins and fold proteins in the winter. Folding in winter, DOS games in summer (surprisingly good backwards compatibility). Won't fold much with 10 year old hardware, but it sure tries. It always gives me a kick to see it do "serious computer" things, like it was meant to. &gt; mine buttcoins ... in the winter  Finally, a use for bitcoins other than speculating!  For everyone else: Did you know that the Bitcoin network now uses more electricity than 154 out of 219 countries! The power used in ONE transaction could power the average US family home for a week.  I saw an article recently stating those facts. But I'm curious how they  arrived at the per transaction power usage. Bitcoin doesn't have anything measured in a per-transaction method, rather, it's per-block, which contains numerous transactions (think of a block like a new page in a ledger, and the number-crunching is the network agreeing that the submitted sheet is the authentic next page in sequence). The amount of energy to "solve" a block is highly variable, and I don't think you could just take an average power use for any given block and divide that by the number of transactions. That seems an ill-conceived approach. &gt; The power used in ONE transaction could power the average US family home for a week.  Which should really be the nail in the coffin for the idea of Bitcoin replacing other currencies. The cost of a credit card transaction or handing someone cash, even if you take into account the manufacture of the credit card machine or the cash/coin, is basically negligible unless you're paying purely in pennies. If the cost of a transaction if $4, then what's the point in buying day to day items with it? If I can't buy day to day items with it, is it a useful currency? And if it's purely something that you put money into as an "investment", well, what are you investing in?  Also, as long as we're shilling for Big LED, LEDs are dimmable (sometimes) and don't contain toxic mercury that needs special disposal like fluorescent tubes. Sometimes technology is just better in every way. Except the snowy traffic lights.  there's some things they need to work on. The dimming thing isn't all the way there yet (Pro Tip it's probably your old rheostat)   My biggest issue is the warmth (or ice coldness) of LED. I hope they keep working on making them warmer because I really miss incandescent warmth. I don't want my house to be lit up like a grocery store or hospital OR.   I understand that standard socket bulbs are okay but specialty sockets are hard to find, especially replacements for track lighting halogen and things like stovehood light bulbs, decorative lights, etc.  they have warm light LEDs now, for the last 5 years at least I wouldn't think it's be too hard to put in a heater system.  Even the light emitted eventually turns to heat when the light hits objects and not all of it is reflected.  The only parts that don't heat the house are the rays that escape to the outside.  So it is probably more like 9 watts of heat from the LED and 59 watts of heat from the incandescent. Definitely... NASA actually theorized that you could heat a 10' room to around 90 degrees with just a single 100w incandescent bulb if the walls of the room had a coating of Aerogel just 1 inch thick. Here is an interesting article written by a man who did that to his living room  https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/11/24/diy_insulation_with_aerogel/ The deeper article you want to click-through to:  http://www.earth.org.uk/superinsulating-our-living-room.html 15 60w bulbs emit as much heat as a small space heater, or a larger one set on 'low'. About as much as a toaster oven. An LED fixture that emits the same amount of light as a 60w incandescent bulb only uses 8-10w. Fifteen of these would only emit as much heat as an Xbox 360.  Every watt of electricity you use in your house will become heat. So 800w of electric motors, stereo systems, computers, fans, ect will heat up a sealed room as much as an 800w heater would. This is why one end of your air conditioner has to be outside, because it works by pumping heat from one side to to the other. Have you ever heard of a little thing called the e-z-bake oven? Hell, my computer usually kept my room ~10 degrees warmer than the rest of the house. But yeah lights do produce that much heat. I use a lot of traditional light bulbs (instead of actual heat bulbs) on some reptile tanks that like it just a bit warmer than temperate for that reason 40 to 100 watts depending on the bulb.  A small 5-15sq-ft heater (most of a small room) will do wonders for a workspace in an efficient home. It's only temporary and a more localized heat zone.  They make LED lights that also emit heat.  I had a set of JW Speaker LED lights on my Rubicon and they heated the front lens.  The new Truck-Lite headlights also have a built in heated lens.   I swear I've read articles about this same issue every winter for at least the last 3 years.  That's because you have. In cold climates they usually have heaters built in.  No, they have put bubble shaped plastic covers over the lights to prevent the snow from packing in over the lights cover.  https://imgur.com/gallery/CuGyW It’s both. Electronics don’t like the extreeeeeeeeem cold so some electronics built for cold climates have heaters built in.  You have Yeah, I remember reading an article about a city in Japan having the exact same issue a year or two back. I think they ended up putting heating elements in the lights to help melt the snow. Pretty simple traffic law, when the light doesn't function you treat it as a 4 way stop.  Of course when only one side thinks its functioning you have a serious problem on your hands.  Remember this being part of the discussion when Cleveland was evaluating changing.   I'm surprised Minny would even try it.  &gt; Pretty simple traffic law, when the light doesn't function you treat it as a 4 way stop. Of course when only one side thinks its functioning you have a serious problem on your hands.  Serious question, is there a law for this situation? 4 ways stop is when the lights are not working such as due to power failure, But snow covered light would be for one lane. How would the driver proceed? Assume 4 ways stop and hope the cross road doesn't have green?  Cross road traffic may not be aware of problem since they likely can see lights normally and traffic lights aren't designed so one driver could see all 4 sides at once. You wait for there to be an accident and someone to come out and fix it. This is Minnesota.  So you courteously wave others through until you are eventually forced to abandon your car. I don't know that there is.  I think you'd just have to watch what the oncoming traffic is doing and cross your fingers Or we could put a small heating element in stoplights to melt the snow when it's cold... No, that’s craziness. Perhaps we could invent a device that both emits light and gets warm. and waste all the energy when it's not cold? But that involves people actually knowing the rules of the road and not feeling that the road is theirs first... which I’m not sure even exists anymore There’s a driving test to get the license. Eh? That most people take once as a teen then forget all of the rules within the next few years. They forget as soon as they leave the DMV Californian here, don't believe so. Based on this comment you must have gotten your license more than 45 or 50 minutes ago.  Source: Californian. Most people take that test *once* in their life at around 16 or so.  And like all tests, they study for it to pass, not to learn the content of the subject.  16 years later, the 32 year old has likely gotten into the habit of driving every day, and developed some driving techniques that are down right wrong.  By the time they are 48 (my age), again sixteen years later, the laws may have changed, or they simply no longer care about anything but getting from where they are to where they are going and damn those who get in their way.  Of course they have to pay insurance, but insurance for a 48 year old is cheaper than it is for a 16 year old, even if the 16 year old has a perfect driving record.  It's why I'm in favor of the idea that every time you have to renew your driver's license, you have to take the written and driving exam again, or you don't get to renew it. I can't tell you how many times I've stopped at a light that was out due to power outage and had the person behind me lay on their horn and flip me off. Same here in the DC area, only I've had them go as far as jump out of their cars to yell at me because they nearly ass-ended me.  Same goes for when I stop at crosswalks.  My brother has had the same problem only he's a police officer and will make them pull over and wait while he teaches them motor vehicle law if he's not in a hurry. So what if the lights going one directly only are covered in snow, how does traffic coming the other way have any clue things are fucked?  This is one example of a place where LED's might not have been the best choice. If the light is covered in your direction you treat it as a stop sign.  If opposing traffic isn't yielding, you don't go through your stop sign. This is exactly what happens. Seen it firsthand as a Minnesotan in the last two snowstorms. Happens here in the Chicago area too. The simple solution is install the heaters, lose the efficiency but gain not having to replace them as often. Also use up the stocks of existing bulbs first.  I remember first reading about this issue over in Milwaukee about four years ago Also, it's only lost efficiency when they are needed. They're not on for no reason in the summer.  If you are constantly waiting you realize there is a problem thats when all sides start getting involved. If you are a local you know how the lights turn so you can guess.  If not all cars start to edge out until the ones going through stop and the other 3 work out who is next. People get it working eventually, Humans are good at this. What, you mean the snow doesn't blow in four different directions at the same place and time?  living near Cleveland and having been to Chicago and St. Cloud during the winter, I can confirm that it does, lol.  Not that often though. This works fine when *a* light is out, but if it is a problem that spreads across a city, even a small one, then it becomes a different kind of problem due to emerging properties. Think massive gridlock. so... *"Imagine if you don't live in bum-fuck-nowhere"*  ^_ Sincerely; People who live with traffic.  Not if you live someplace that actually gets snow. These things aren't able to do the job without the extra crap they've tossed on them here to keep snow from building up in the first place. How can you call is a simple traffic law when you immediately provide a reason why it isn't simple? Part of the problem with this, that I’ve seen firsthand in the last two snowstorms here in MN is that usually only one directions of lights are obstructed, so the for the other three directions, it’s business as usual because they don’t know any better. This right here... the 4 way stop only works when all 4 ways are aware the lights are obstructed. When the snow is blowing one direction, 2 or 3 directions will still see a green or red light. Minnesotans don’t understand “simple” traffic laws.  The simple rule of left turn yield on green was too complicated, so now we have installed flashing yellow arrows for left turns... Sometimes I make a joke at a red light saying, I can make a left here on red. Well, jokes on me because a few weeks ago I was at a red light in left turning lane. Some guy honked me. I was like WTF. He does it again. And the I see the sign. Left on red allowed after stop. I never saw that before. &gt; Left on red allowed after stop.  In most states, from one way street to one way street. That makes sense. I just never saw a sign like that before. Michigan is just onto a one way street. I've been living in this state for a while and I will say Minnesota drivers are FAR BETTER than Texas drivers. Lol non-California people saying how bad their drivers are. NJ is worse than Cali. NJ is Cali in terms of driver quality.  Am from NJ, have driven to and through cali.  Neither are as bad as NY, and no one is as bad as Mass.    Just holy crap, people in Mass. drive like fucking maniacs.   People in Mass drive fast. People in NJ drive aggressively. And people in Cali are 50-50 to drive aggressively or super slowly. harder to predict the Cali drivers, but also less need to.  Edit: lived in all three. Just moved to Mass from CA.  I don't find Mass drivers to be particularly fast but they are consistently assholes.   Try the Bay area. Hardly anyone gets pulled over ever you can just pretty much run any stop sign or light you want. If you don't crash you can drive as you like without consequence. Look at the bottom cities: https://wallethub.com/edu/best-worst-cities-to-drive-in/13964/ New England drivers are worse.   I was in LA a few months ago and thought the drivers were way better then Tampa FL.  Almost saw a motorcycleist become a fucking splat on the freeway yesterday.  The freeway was packed, but it was moving at a good 50-55mph.  I look over my shoulder and see this motorcycle lane splitting, FLYING up from maybe 25-50? yards behind (He had to have been doing over 75).  I look back forward and see this red car about 4 car lengths ahead with his left blinker on, who then starts getting over, no chance to even see this moron on the bike.  Luckily the bike was able to get left of the red car, and then left onto the shoulder.  If there hadn't been a gap, the dude would have been fucking toast.  What kind of fucking idiot lane splits in 55 mph traffic, going 20-30mph faster than everyone else?! I swear the further south you go the worse people are at driving, and the further north you go people drive more like assholes.  I tend to agree. Lots of asshole drivers by me, but not as many accidents as I saw when I was in Florida. On straight roads too. All the time in the same areas. Impatient and because everything is so open I don't think they learn the good defensive driving skills one needs to understand in a big city. OH my God, Florida saw two separate single car accidents where the car flipped exiting the highway on a cloverleaf exit.  I don't know if you're familiar with the UCF area, but there's a long main road call Alafaya Trail. Everyday there would be accidents. And it's a straight road, and to turn there are openings. People need to learn what mirrors are for. Cause that's the only way these accidents can occur. Just wait til it snows. Heh, last time I was driving in Texas, people in jacked up pickup trucks would drive around me in the grass whenever I came to a red light on an exit ramp. Just right over the curb, onto the grass and around the stopped traffic and onto the road. I thought it was a fluke, but then it happened several times in the same day.  Native Minnesotan living in Denver.  Denver drivers are worse. Advanced greens are really good for places where there's a lot of people that need to turn left. Places in suburban Atlanta did this, too. Now people with no oncoming traffic just sit, confused by the flashing arrow, waiting for it to turn green. I'm pretty sure flashing yellow is used for left turn lanes where there is not an option to go strait. Typically, a single set of traffic lights is used to control all lanes from one direction. Green means you have the ROW going straight, but turning traffic must yield. It has always been that way. But for some reason, some cities thought it was a good idea to put a separate light above _every single lane_, necessitating a special flashing yellow light for turning traffic.  The only legitimate use of these lights I can think of is where traffic cannot continue forward, but _can_ turn while yielding to other traffic. For example, on King Street in Toronto, which recently started a pilot project that forces motorists to turn right at the end of every block in order to optimise the streetcar route. The current situation is a green light with some signs restricting left turns and straight-throughs, which is not ideal because people don't see the signs. This is not a common situation. I'm not convinced any of you motorists understand traffic laws. And here I am living in North Minneapolis where most of the lights I see are specifically labeled for no right turn on red  In Louisiana, drivers don't even know what an arrow is. No joke. I pulled over to check on an accident with no police around yet and one of the drivers asked, "What is an arrow?".  Well, Louisiana also decided that a ziplock bag counters as a closed container, so what are you going to do? Well you can only see the arrow if you look up from your phone. A lot of places do this. That is most states bub This is a federal thing. They are being installed across the country. That makes too much sense.  Just like slower moving cars should stay in the right lane but there’s always slow pokes in the passing lane doing 5 under. It never works smoothly in practice. The big 8+ way intersections are nightmares when the lights go down. It takes one sheepish person or an inconsiderate asshole and it just shuts down.  &gt; I'm surprised Minny would even try it.  The financial savings of LED are just too enticing. The ultimate solution will be thermostatically controlled heaters. The amount of energy needed to prevent snow blocking would still be far less through the snow season than incandescent energy use. Yeah as long as it ultimately pays off in electrical costs that makes sense.  Old bulbs probably aren't the most efficient heat source. Unfortunatly I've come to the sad realisation that people simply don't know how to operate a 4-way stop. that's true, even at stop signs it somehow seems like a struggle sometimes.  flashing red light?...forget about it, lol It all comes crashing down as soon as it becomes more than one lane in each direction. Simply too inefficient. Usually when this happens, I see about 5-10 cars taking turns to go through the intersection at a time. Even 1 lane in each direction seems to complicated for people nowadays.  I remember when they first mentioned introducing right turn on red lights in the city, the mayor at the time said that he was hesitant to do so because he felt drivers would need to seriously behave better for this to work. Boy was he right, they put it in effect and 10 years later people still don't know how to do it properly. Or install traffic circles. No lighted controls then. I live near Bend, Oregon ..they have a ton of them. I'm not a fan of them in the winter. I feel like they are far more dangerous in places that get ice. SW Michigan. We have them here. The issue with snow is that if the plows don't pay attention, trucks will get stuck in them with longer trailers.   Accidents in circles are less likely to be severe. Sliding through a circle won't create a T-bone like an intersection would.  But yes, for moderate density intersection, traffic circles are immune to issues with lights.  Ha I went to high school in Bend. There was a roundabout near my school. Probably a dozen times in the winter, I would start to slide in the same spot in that one roundabout. Not sure why that one in particular, I went through like 7 on that trip. Never got out of control though (always made it where I was planning on going and stayed on the road), and I got used to it (and slowed down).  Honestly yeah they aren't great in ice but I've had worse close calls at stop lights and stop signs. At least roundabouts often you don't have to stop (which can be hard to do with ice). Worst problem for me was one time I was driving up the hill on Reed Market at the stoplight for the Parkway ramp, I was barely able to accelerate and get going, I had to floor it for like 5 seconds before I started moving. not sure how cost effective that would be in the short term It's not. I dunno the real cost, but I'd image well into the several hundred thousand per intersection. Long term, it's probably a net societal gain due to lower ongoing maintenance, lower accident rates, etc.   It is rather comical to see people who haven't a clue drive around them. I almost got hit a year ago because somebody backed up in one.  The other failure mode is that people assume it is basically a 4 way yield (for smaller circles). They don't know that right of way is ceded to the person in the circle. So I've entered a circle, only to have people blow the yield right in front of me - without even looking left. But because it's a traffic circle, speeds where low enough that I could slow down and miss them.   But the part of town the circles are in - I basically assume drivers are idiots and drive with an extra measure of defensiveness. There aren't many close to wear I live, only in the city centers of old little towns, so the first time I encountered one in Jersey (that have a lot of them), I was a bit bewildered too. It's just like a scaled down free-way merge. The car on the left has right of way. As someone who lives in a place where we don't get a lot of snow..... this scenario really bothers me on a personal level I had that issue last winter. My light was fine but the cross traffic light was blocked by snow. I was nearly hit multiple times thinking people were going to stop. That was some butt clenching stuff right there.  That should not be standard practice every time it snows. Something needs to melt the snow.  agree.  I wasn't under the impression this happened that frequently though.  There's still some heat emitted and the surfaces, I can only imagine are designed for this not to happen.  Probably only a problem in the wet, sticky sideways snow the Midwest gets sometimes. Minny? I've lived here my entire life and not once have I ever heard anyone refer to MN or Mpls as Minny. Wtf? Certainly didn't mean any offense.  I'm from Ohio and have heard the term used in the context of professional sports reasonably regularly.  Perhaps we're just still bitter about what Ahmad Rashad did to us in December 1980. LOL, this worked very well when I lived in Pittsburgh, PA, but when I moved to the DC area a decade ago I've yet to see anyone abide by this when lights are out, even once, and they're out here more frequently than in Pittsburgh.  I think it's a two-fold problem, 1) the population in the DC area never learned/doesn't care about the motor laws in this country, and/or 2) the average driver in the DC area has very little if any understanding or desire to abide by any concepts related to common courtesy.  Seriously, everyone's out for themselves to the point where even mentioning someone's lack of courtesy will be met with blank stares at best, violence or threat of violence at worst, with the violence coming FROM the person in the wrong.   This is a problem that can be solved by $5 worth of heat trace.  We've been doing this for ages. Never heard of these before - would these work for heating an outdoor cat shelter made mostly of wood? No, they're not meant to heat the air.  They're meant to heat whatever they're in contact with so it doesn't freeze or develop a layer of ice.  And you need an electrical connection (trivial for a traffic light, less so for a cat shelter). So you're saying to cover the cat with it and strap it up with a battery pack?  I've seen this movie, it ends with a robot cat coming back in time to kill John Conner. Do you do industrial heat tracing? I've installed a lot of outdoor equipment, crankcase heaters, heat trace on water lines, etc. are all very common.   You might think it's something exotic, but no, it's a wire that gets hot when you run electricity through it - just like the incandescent bulbs get hot when you run electricity through them (essentially it's a crappy wire).  Only thing is, you can run it only when there's danger of ice build up, and 99% of the year save an enormous amount of electricity.  Solid state, no moving parts, I've never seen heat trace fail outside of actual physical damage to the wire. &gt; You might think it's something exotic, but no, it's a wire that gets hot when you run electricity through it  They're basically durable resistors. Resistors turn electricity into heat as a matter of course. Most of the time, it's waste heat, some of the times it's wanted heat.  That's all heating elements essentially are - resistors. Really simple technology that's been around as long as electrical engineering. I've only seen it in industrial applications but I live in Texas so maybe that's why I've never seen it elsewhere or maybe I don't pay attention enough. Now I can spot an un level conduit from a mile away but that's only because I primarily do electrical.  If there's any heat trace in Texas it's probably because the vendor delivered it to you pretraced by accident.  You really don't need it until you get below freezing for extended periods of time.    Oh!  Cars often have it on their rear windows to defrost the windows, you've probably seen the thin black lines there.  That's really fine heat trace wire, but it should be a similar principle for a traffic light.   Edit: [Here's a metric asston of it, you usually don't need this much](http://www.offshore-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/09/pentair-cables-lg.jpg) We don't get below freezing here but maybe every 4yrs. I know about defroster lines and heat trace in general just never seen it in use outside of industrial applications besides defroster lines. Probably more common than you think. Big building? Unless you see people shovelling snow up there they probably have some kind of heat tracing system to remove the shit tonne of snow.  It doesn't snow where I'm from, yesterday we got our first bit of colder weather. Are those wires the same things that cars have on their rear windows for defrosting? Yup.  They'd work fine for defrosting traffic light glass too.  It's just a silly oversight. I looked into this before and had a "simple" solution (not really simple since it does cost money to replace these lights). Redesign the traffic lights to be oriented horizontally instead of vertically (so red yellow green goes from left to right instead of top to bottom). Remove the bottom half of the "cone" around the lights allowing snow to drop down instead of collecting. Too simple.  We need something that costs millions to design and millions more to implement. Source : used to work for government.  They don't decide the cost and complexity, that's up to the contractors. Or a simple heating circuit?  A thermistor (electrical thermometer) to control a heating system like your car mirrors. Set it to come on below a set temperature. Relatively cheap if incorporated into mass production of replacement lamps. It would also be possible to retrofit a heating board behind the lamp but less efficient and cost to fit.  Oh, I bet that's why Wisconsin has horizontal lights! They're designed almost exactly as you describe.  You mean like this ?  http://www.orangetraffic.com/wp-content/uploads/images%20produits/models/OT-feux-circulation-A-web.jpg Not one engineer thought to put some form of heating/de-icing element on those things!? I'm an intern at an elecrical engineering firm in Fairbanks Alaska, and  everyone at the office hates heat trace. It's expensive, and a massive power sink. The whole reason to switch over to LED lamps is to save power, so adding more electrical load by placing down heat trace seems pretty counter productive. I'm not totally sure, as I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I wouldn't be surprised if the heat traced LEDs have equal or worse efficient than the older less efficient lamps. Or at lest not enough energy saving to justify the added cost. ie: a payback time of longer than 15 years or something similar. Remember, the extra heat is only needed when snow buildup is present. The rest of the year is saving money on electricity and bulb replacement labor. Say the baseline was a 150W bulb. Now there is a 10W LED and 190W heater. That heater only needs to run for ~3-4 months of the year - less if there is a thermal sensor someplace in the system.   Still a net savings. Wasn't this already addressed years ago? I though heating elements were standard in these lights, since the heat output is gone. How is this news? BREAKING - Water is wet. This is why modern railroad signals have one large and deep shroud that is wider at the bottom.  Railroads learned long ago that the new LED lamps can't melt the snow.  Wonder if a hydrophobic coating on the light and enclosure would have an appreciable effect - also how long that would stay on it over time. well new Fodder for /r/Conspiracy  **Led Lights dont melt Snowflakes!**  Just hope the solution is not to install 1000w heaters to blow on the lights. But in these times you never know. It might not be a bad idea to install a heating element that kicks in when the temp drops under a certain point. It wouldn't necessarily take any more power than the traditional bulbs did and it wouldn't need to be turned on more than a few months out the year anyway.  The cost of the system would increase greatly though. You'd have to weigh it against the energy expenses of traditional bulbs. I think it'd come out ahead after a time, but the initial cost to fit and replace every stop light is going to be expensive. Long term infrastructure projects are generally a good thing though.   Haha, no. The heat tape is cheap and it's on a thermostat. It consumes far less than a light bulb when the heater is activated. A single light is also cheap but when you times it by a billion it starts to get expensive. So is changing incandescent bulbs on a regular basis, which is the costly reason that they changed in the first place. The energy savings are just a bonus. Yes, adding up the labor cost of frequently changing incandescent bulbs and their power consumption, the LEDs win even with augmented heating.  I personally own a few different kinds of traffic lights and the bulbs are 300 watt with very thick filaments with metal reflectors inside.  These consume a *lot* of energy.  Compared to an LED with a heater there is no contest.  The LED with heater is easily a small fraction of the power consumption of the old incandescent bulbs.  The heater only runs when it's cold, so it's a win-win.  You don't need a lot of heat. A bone dead simple thing like a niachrome wire near the lights, with even a simple sensor to turn it on or off would likely fix the issue. As there's likely already a control system, the small heaters could probably be controlled from a central location, so it was only on when there was precipitation or similar, to save the most energy.   They should have made the lights with those wires that they use in the rear window of cars. Turn on during a snowstorm. Turn off after its over.  They do.  Not all jurisdictions buy them. Well that's pretty short-sighted. Now if they want to upgrade them, it'll cost more money than if they just installed those the first time. Yes, but that's their fault, but it's due to not knowing the future.  To be fair, it probably didn't occur to everyone that icing would be a problem with these low-power lamps.  The railroads learned this the hard way and their new signals addressed it with a robust shroud (also, historically, the railroads place the red light on the bottom of the three-light units to avoid it being obscured by snow and ice in any case).  Easy solution: Include a small heating element. Some frosty neighborhoods have that on street lamps.  They should put covers topside of the lens, not only to protect from weather but to limit upward facing light pollution.  It's as simple as installing a heating element that is remotely controlled from the traffic control center. Use a drone with a blow torch to clear ‘em.  Can confirm.  Have LED headlights on my Jeep.  Have to get out and wipe the snow off every 10 fucking minutes.  City planners are so Smart! SMRT! They did this in my town in Colorado to save money on electricity only to end up spending more money heating the lights so snow didn’t cover them.  Haha, no.  It still saves energy most of the year (they are on thermostats) and the heating element consumes far less than the old light bulb did.  TIL - people can't do math in this thread.  Say the baseline was a 200W incandescent bulb. Now there are a few 9W LEDs in there. Just add a ~180W heater - that only needs to run for a few months of the year. Bonus if the heater is attached directly to the lens, now it's more thermally efficient than before. I own a few surplus traffic lights, some of which came with the original bulbs.  They were rated 300 watts and the filaments were really thick.  Standing in front of them you can feel the heat through your jacket.  &gt; They did this in my town in Colorado to save money on electricity only  No, they did it because the incandescent light bulbs have to be changed on a regular basis, which is expensive. The energy savings are a nice bonus. I mean, the designing engineers would have done a return on investment analysis of the LED lamps, and given a time line of when the LEDs would effectivly pay for themselves. Highly doubt this Agree. I’ve seen snow covered traffic lights so heavily covered they were impossible to discern if the driver didnt pay close attention.  *yesss, yesss, goooood* [deleted] Runways wouldn't be allowable per the FAA, unless something has changed. LED taxiway lighting is allowed, however. Flexible printed film thermistors could solve this problem fairly easily. They're already used in the auto industry to heat side mirrors, and the devices are stupidly easy to make.  Of course, hooking them up to thermostats and installing them into stoplights would probably require a total redesign of the stoplight housing unless a clever retrofit could be devised.  Source: personal experience with the technology platform Shouldn't the older lights that have one bulb in a box on the corner of the street, and fiber optic lines running to the lenses, have this problem too?  I'm too lazy to solve this problem  Should’ve gotten the lights with built in heating filaments.  Just need someone on top of the lights with a hair dryer. Boom solved. On the NPR show “car talk” Click and clack talked about this happening in Cambridge, Massachusetts years ago. Cambridge went back to incandescent.   Weird that other cities are repeating the mistake. There hard enough to see to begin with, there is one intersection with leds near me and you can't really see the color till your almost under it especially on sunny days.
 Normally this would be good in calming them the fuck down, but with Trump I can't help but wonder if it would be less offensive to just bomb them as opposed to whatever Trump is going to say. You're worried about offending Kim Jong Un? Na I'm just saying, if you want the path to peace or negotiations with any nation, its probably less offensive to just bomb them then to let Trump let off a Trumpism. Unless of course you want to fray relations further. I think that relations are so bad that they can't get any worse.  The only way out that I can imagine is that Kim gets overthrown in a military coup. Should we keep appeasing them? Anyone with an educated answer please respond. I dint understand how letting them become more and more advanced is a good idea. Theres no good solution, its been an awkward uncomfortable stalemate for ages.  South Korea does not want to reintergrate NK because its a shithole and would tank their economy, China does not want SK/US to rule the land on their border. The NK regime is vicious and fucking terrible, but it can't be easily removed. They are really dug in and have a ton of firepower ready to unload on SK. Which obviously SK does not want to happen. And Chinese support. At least in theory. NK developing nukes makes removing them as a threat through military harder, and I think the only sad solution is to keep doing what we've always been doing, supplying them with food in exchange for nuclear disarmament. 
 I can't imagine the pain they are going through. Even if you have an evac plan, it takes time to get all those animals out. Grass fires are so quick, especially with the wind backing it up. They probably barely had time to get themselves out.  If this is the same facility I'm thinking of I believe they also do horse therapy for children with autism. They used to use old retired horses to walk with the kids or let the kids ride them. Those kids really needed that. I hope this isn't the end for that kind of thing. This is absolutely tragic.  My sincere condolences for the owners of the horses lost, and the keepers of the ranch.
 Executives being responsible if their corporation commits crimes is good, just that it only applies in this one specific case is so weird  Well america suing a german competing company? Sure  If they were american it would have gone different Yes, in America they probably would have gotten a raise  Aww yes the American way stomping out competition rather then compete anything american is becoming shit VW could have been fined out of existence in the US.  They were facing something like 500 billion in fines since each car sold was illegal. America deserves a lot of criticism for being anticompetitive douche bags but here is not a solid example.  Ic thanks for knowledge for knowledge is power  Remember the "unintended acceleration" thing from Toyota that Obama attacked so strongly? Just a coincidence that he had just illegally transferred ownership of GM to the UAW, one of his biggest donors.  &gt; coincidence that he had just illegally transferred ownership of GM to the UAW  Maybe one day you'll get tired of Alex Jones lying to you.

More like *stink* tank! &lt;Billy Madison face&gt;  But really, its reputation is [a shell of what it once was.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/09/the-fall-of-the-heritage-foundation-and-the-death-of-republican-ideas/279955/)  &gt;But there is more at stake in Heritage’s transformation from august policy shop to political hit squad than the reputation of a D.C. think tank or even the careers of a few squishy GOP politicians. It is the intellectual project of the conservative movement itself. Without Heritage, the GOP’s intellectual backbone is severely weakened, and the party’s chance to retake its place as a substantive voice in American policy is in jeopardy.  The reality is few people will look at heritage as anything other than the PR arm of a few multi-billionaires, a reputation they've earned in more recent years.  I did read through the National Affairs article though. It offered up some very reasonable concerns and criticisms that I wouldn't normally come across. It didn't however get anywhere close to this (illegally transferred ownership of GM to the UAW) statement. Who read it for you?  Wow, a crooked executive going to prison for corruption that hurt people. That's really interesting. . .as an American, I've never seen that. . .although should have many times over. &gt; as an American, I've never seen that  Were you not around during Enron? That was some of Mueller's handiwork and he did not fuck around. My guess is that this guy worked for the wrong corporation. If it was an American company my guess is that they wouldn't even check the emissions. Ummmm...yeah they would've.  They were caught because researchers at WVU were, ironically, doing a paper on how great VW diesel engines were...then realized that the engines were awful.  It was at that point they had realized that they were doing real world tests (i.e. driving the car out on public roads under various loads and conditions as one would in normal, everyday driving) while EPA tests are confined within labs and are heavily controlled which lead the researchers to believe that VW was cheating somehow and tipped off the EPA.  So it had nothing to do with the fact that it was a company based out of the US and more to do with the fact that, prior to this scandal, VW had a reputation of building the most efficient diesel engines on the planet.  These days it really doesn't matter where your main headquarters is, VW hires many Americans, has a plant in Tennessee and has a large US corporate headquarters just minutes from Dulles International Airport. &gt; They were caught because researchers at WVU were, ironically, doing a paper on how great VW diesel engines were...then realized that the engines were awful.  Which is why there's a concerted attack on research institutions in the US.  interesting  care to link the source. If thats the case Vw  forgot the first rule of cheating, dont pass the test with such flying colors it  looks suspicious.   Here you go, from [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2015/09/24/443053672/how-a-little-lab-in-west-virginia-caught-volkswagens-big-cheat).  An excerpt:  &gt;WVU research assistant professor Arvind Thiruvengadam and his colleagues test and experiment on cars and engines. He admits his is not the sexiest lab on campus, but he says he got superexcited when they won a grant in 2012 to test a few diesel cars.  &gt;"Our happiness was, 'Wow, we are going to be the first guys to test diesel cars on the road,' " he says. "And then after that, when we were getting the data we were like 'OK, we're going to write a lot of journal papers, and we'll be happy if three people read these journal papers.' That's our happiness at that point."  &gt;The International Council on Clean Transportation is a nonprofit that tries to provide independent science to government agencies that regulate the environment. It hired the university to do a standard emissions tests on diesel cars in the U.S. Volkswagen has been hyping diesel cars that are environmentally friendly and fuel efficient. Volkswagen had the boldest claims and the highest sales, but Thiruvengadam tested two VW cars and found that the claims of low emissions never panned out in the real world.  &gt;"We were never seeing those low emissions during most part of our drives on the interstate. That part of the emissions program was interesting," he says.  &gt;In none of their road tests could they get their two Volkswagen cars to meet the claims, even though a BMW they tested did fine. Very early on it was pretty clear to the scientists that something was wrong. I can think of several CEO’s that have been sent to prison just off the top of my head. Yeah..."prison." More like guarded resort. How did it hurt people? You candy ass liberals are dumb. It helped fuel economy and performance.

See, because we all share the same air. The people at Volkswagen made cars that put bad stuff in the air. Other people also put bad stuff in the air so it's really hard to measure exactly how much bad stuff is out there. The bad stuff in the air made some normal people a little bit sick, and it made sick people even more sick. But because it is everywhere, it's hard to point at a sick person and say "they got sick because of Volkswagen bad stuff in the air!"  We know that Volkswagen agrees that they did bad thing because they agreed to pay lots of money to try to make things better. You can read more about the bad stuff in the air and the money Volkswagen paid [in this article](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/volkswagen-clean-air-act-civil-settlement) but it's got some pretty big words in it so you might wanna ask your parents to read through it with you. You're retarded. Fucking liberals just ruin what consumers want. I have to buy more fuel because of these idiots.

I'm not having kids and so I'm going to make my time on here the best it can be. The EPA is just bloated and is a loss for Americans. It could be argued that the very lack of freedom is what makes it unamerican Typical conservative selfishness. "I don't mind being a asshole because it doesn't hurt me, even if it will hurt somebody else!"  It’s not even just about hurting people, dude. It’s deceptive business practices. I own one of these cars right now and i remember telling everyone how cool it was that the fuel economy was so awesome but it was still fun to drive.  Now i feel like i got played.  http://www.icopal-noxite.co.uk/nox-problem/nox-pollution.aspx Hey how many years did GM execs get for trying to cover up their faulty ignition switches that actually killed people?  Pretty sure zero.  Engineers emailed each other calling it "the ignition switch from hell" - the problem is that they were pretty much in the middle of production when it became a known issue, if I'm not mistaken. The switch occasionally deactivated power steering and power breaking if the keys were heavy enough, due to the way the electronics were wired, IIRC. So fucked. Had nothing to do with the way electronics were wired. There was a specification that said at a minimum x amount of force must be required to turn the key. Their ignition came in under that. Led to heavy keychains causing the key to turn off because of their weight. The issue was discovered and fixed, but they told nobody, issuing zero recalls. They also didn't change the part number to easily tell defective from non defective parts. Worked at gm. There was recalls. yeah, wayyyyyyyyyyy later. nope, it was all about the torque the tumbler needed to turn. it was wrong. But did they lie to feds? That’s the kicker.  They kinda did. They were supposed to report the problem to the NTSB as soon as it was discovered. Instead they covered it up. In court that is not lying. You can't just make up terms in a legal setting. Hence "kinda". There's a huge difference between "trying to cover up" a defect and designing an elaborate method to deceive a regulatory body. VW knowingly lied and polluted the planet though. They didn't make an error. GM knowingly covered up their error  this pisses me off so much. &gt; Schmidt asked U.S. District Judge Sean Cox to limit his sentence to 40 months, saying he’d been coached to lie about emissions by his bosses.  Probably true, but even if this guy is taking the fall for people above him I'm glad it's clear that "Just following orders" isn't a valid excuse.  It has a long history in Germany. Lied about ~~mileage~~ emissions?  *7 years in prison*   Defraud taxpayers and the U.S. government? *Bailouts, tax breaks and Golden Parachutes all round!*  thanks to u/mrfoof82  for the correction They didn't lie about gas mileage.  They lied about emissions.  It isn't over for VW either.  Not the US, but in Germany, and Porsche's former head of R&amp;D is just one in the crosshairs.  The former CEO of VW is under investigation, as several other very prominent individuals from the VW Group.  This was the nail in the coffin for diesel.  Legislation is being rolled out (or discussed) throughout Europe to start phasing it out.  VW Group sells TONS of diesels in Europe, and now looking to dump many billions into electric R&amp;D. I still think there's a massive disparity between polluting slightly more than [still quite a lot], and causing a worldwide recession that saw 6 million Americans lose their homes.  It's almost like America is in the pocket of big business, finding ways to strangle the lower class for fun and profit...  Not like they have legalized bribery or anything. /s GM did not cause a worldwide recession that caused Americans to lose their homes.  Mortgage companies, investment banks, and companies like AIG did that.  GM fell due to that same recession since the last thing someone wants to do when they're going through foreclosure is to buy a new car, well that and they built shitty cars. Yeah, no shit. I was referring to the fact that no bankers (well, wasn’t it only one, in Iceland?) or regulators went to prison despite having a hand in all the fuckups that lead to the recession.   Was that not obvious? No, but that's because I'm retarded, I agree with your point though. The type of pollution they lied about has severe effects locally, knocking years off the lives of people in cities. My point was that even if they hadn’t been cheating emissions tests, they would still have been kicking out all those nasty particulates you get from diesel combustion, just at slightly lower levels. It’s not like below that threshold diesel engines are magically clean.  The levels weren’t slightly lower.  It was up to an order of magnitude (10x) difference or more for some particulates.  It’s why the punishment in the US will be seen as a footnote, as what’ll be doled out by a Germany is likely going to be exceptionally brutal, as most EU countries tax vehicles based on emissions, and have had far stricter standards for a long time.  For example, the penalties levied to a manufacturer for having fleet economy worse than a certain threshold (CAFE) is only 2-3% of what the EU levies for emissions related targets.  The US raised the stink, but the EU is who VW really fears (BMW also being investigated as well). Of course it isn't over, because it's not an American company  Because they didn't do anything actually illegal. You might think it was but in court it didn't stick. It's almost as if despite public opinion you have a right to defend yourself in court. Now if only we could manage to get the people responsible for not preventing the Equifax and Yahoo hacks locked up, we'll be making some real progress.  Sadly, this guy will be made an example of and people will soon forget that nothing bad happened to any exec at any major American company within the past ten years. This is just one of a large number of people involved, "taking one for the team". Obviously many others will go unpunished. Still, good to see at least some justice served. Remember when Harley Davidson did the same thing? What HD did was different from what VW did. VW sold cars that did not meet emissions standards stock from the get-go. HD got in trouble for selling aftermarket parts that were only legal for off-road use and thus exempt from emissions rules knowing that people were intending to use them on the road. A Executive?!? sounds to me like they scapegoat a guy for the doings of many I sold VWs for 5 long years; we had "TDIs are clean, Diesels are clean" crammed down our throats constantly in training, during video training, and then passing that dogma on to consumers.  When do I get paid for being trained to lie? &gt; When do I get paid for being trained to lie?  You already did - you were paid to do a job.   when you sue them Glad he got caught, but why did he come back to the US after the scandal broke? He was arrested while on vacation in Miami. His buddies are still in Germany able to spend Christmas with their families and probably avoiding travel to the US.  Does he live in Germany?  I know while he was employed with VW he worked in Auburn Hills, MI for VW of America so at least during that time he lived in the States.   Does anyone know his nationality?  I know the other engineer they arrested was an American. If this were an American company, the head honcho would have probably gotten about $700,000 in fines and that's it.  And these companies constantly train their sales forces with all this bullshit propaganda, to blatantly lie to the customer's face After getting one million in bonuses for taking the punch And murders and rapists get less time.... Wonderful, nonetheless, that a top exec is being charged. Maybe it will make others think. Like maybe we can go after bank execs after the next financial crisis they bring on  And US executives gets ... a massive tax cut.  welcome to trumps america this started well before Trump took the helm... he sure isnt stopping it.............. Do any bought and paid for politicians truly have any incentive to stop the cash flow? Just to play devils advocate....   One could argue that a rapist harms a handful of people (the victim, family, etc) while this emissions scandal arguably harms millions, possibly billions of people. The monetary cost of the crime is exponentially larger in VWs case. It's actually pretty rare for murder to get less than 7 years. Also, what is your point? That murderers should get more time or that the exec should get less time?  Wow, a corrupt exec actually went to jail? Are we starting to make progress by holding these bastards accountable for their actions? no - its because he is not american [deleted] You can say that again. It's funny cause he did. Quite a few times. Were those bespoke GM parts, or were they outsourced?  As someone who works in automotive, it doesn't matter. You're responsible for whatever product you give the customer. I'm sure GM went and beat the shit out of the supplier if they were outsourced. But at the end of the day their engineers, purchasing, executives, etc.. approved and bought off on it. The problem with GM was that a single engineer changed witch switch they used and did not properly document it or change the part number. So when GM tried to investigate and recreate the problem they had trouble even though the ignition switches were the obvious . Eventually they went to salvage yards and and slowly tried to figure out which models were affected. Compared to Volkswagen no one had any idea what was going on. They’re a evil incompetent company, but Volkswagen was an evil competent one. There's nothing inherently evil or good about companies. They are made up of people. There are some pricks in the industry no doubt, but most people are trying to do the right thing. Wasn't Takata sued over the airbags? I think the car companies originally claimed they were duped by Takata (if that is true or not, I don't know). But regardless, they were the ones who paid out the lawsuits. This is complete bullshit for VW. A few of them deserve to be in trouble, but fuck sakes, jail time? America is fucked.  Why is capital punishment not an option here?!? Things like COPD and childrens asthma are directly linked to the micro-particles that get emitted by diesel vehicles. Not even mentioning that these vehicles were willingly sold by the company when they knew they shouldn't have been and what impact this will have on our environment in the long run. We should punish the CEOs just like we would punish a person who committed genocide. You should not be allowed to treat our Earth as a coincidental. These people should be held responsible. 7 years doesn't cut it. I still can't work out what the problem is ? After all isn't global warming a Chinese hoax ? 😉 where is the GM exec in jail for the bullshit they pulled with cobalts and g5s that actually killed people.
 There were members of that jury who refused to convict. Fairly common to find 1 person out of 12 who will not/cannot vote guilty when it’s a cop. I find that to be most concerning. Some people truly believe they can do no wrong. And even those people get jury duty. I’m glad one case has gotten through. The Supreme Court needs to set a new standard when dealing with police killings. With so many police shootings ending terribly, something must be done.  What does the Supreme Court have to do with this case? What standard are you referring to? [the Supreme Court has eveything to do with it. ](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1988/87-6571) Let this be the precedence.


 It's not common. But it's not entirely uncommon either.

This is the fourth time I've been named Times Person of the Year. What’s it like being a Hungarian planet-computer? Ez van, ezt kell szeretni. This saying sums up the socialist era in Hungary. ("This is what is, this is what you have to like") &gt; his saying sums up the socialist era in Hungary. ("This is what is, this is what you have to like")  Good times. This is a question that requires Deep Thought Probably not among the most uplifting reasons.  I've got Trump beat!  "Inheritors" is a way more appropriate designation than "boomers." It sounds vaguely malevolent and creepy. I don't know I just imagine a group of tall spindly men with scales below their throats sitting in a circular conference room discussing how they'll disrupt the economy of Argentina for esoteric reasons. This is a great description of them actually That sounds like the baby boomers to me Boomers inherited a brand new highway system, education that was basically free, and all the other spoils of the Greatest Generation and their sacrifices. Then they spend the rest of their lives CONSUMING and when it's time to give back what do they do? They vote against infrastructure bills, education bills, healthcare bills. Instead they vote and pass bills that make it almost impossible to void student loan debts that they forced on future generations. And lastly, with the last GOP tax bill, they are robbing the middle and lower classes in one final tax heist.  If you're under 60 years old you better WAKE UP before 2018 and vote these people out before they put us all in the poor house to pay for their greens fees on their 2nd and 3rd vacation homes.  It is amusing to have had to listen to Boomers spend the 70s and 80s talking about how they were saving the world and spreading free love and sex, and now listen to the Millennials eviscerate them for being basically selfish reactionaries.   "I won't be coming home tonight  **My generation will put it right**  We're not just making promises  That we know, we'll never keep."  Genesis, Land of Confusion, 1986  It wasn't a bad song, but I heard it on the radio for the first time in like a decade a week or so ago and I all I could do is go "lol".    Especially in that, by pointing at the situation they were handed (by coming up just as the American economy rose to dominate a landscape basically destroyed by the war in a booming labor market) it puts the lie to the whole 'millennials are entitled' shit that assumes that if I paid for college and a down payment on a house with a steady 40-hour-a-week entry-level job (maybe with a BA, maybe nothing past high school), you can too unless you're lazy. Calling them that highlights how they came through at a time when getting ahead in America was ridiculously easy, and hints at how impossible it is now, largely because of their continuing control of corporations and economic structures. Come on, my parent's worked hard to pay totally for college with minimum wage jobs (with enough left over for rent and food) and then buy a house for less than 90% of their annual income and watch it increase in value ten-fold over the next 20 years! See, here's the thing: they did work hard. They can be proud of what they did. But what they *can't* do is assume that the same amount of work will yield the same results now, that the same level job leads to the same lifestyle, or the same dedication to work produces equal career advancement, then as now.  Discussions about the idea of privilege usually come back to "I worked hard for this -- how dare you suggest I'm only successful because I'm white/male/whatever." And it's true, you probably did work hard. The point isn't to say you didn't -- it's to acknowledge that lots of other people also worked their asses off, as much as you did or maybe twice as much, and didn't reach success, because you worked hard *and* had connections through your parents, or could afford to spend a year on an unpaid internship, or were unfairly seen as more trustworthy than coworkers just because you were white in a black-majority high-crime area. It doesn't mean you should get no credit -- it means you shouldn't assume that anyone who *didn't* get that high-paying job didn't work hard, or that you were all competing on a level playing field.  So, no, I don't think all Inheritors (I like it) are lazy. But I do think they came along at an ideal time to be able to afford their lifestyles pretty easily, and that's nothing to hold against them, but it does make it infuriating when they blame our troubles on us by ignoring how much different the job market, career field, and economic realities are now. So 8 times in the first 74 years of the award, and 7 times in the past 16 years. They should just rename it "Story of the Year" at this point. I mean... They're all "stories" of the year. One can't be named person of the year without having a story behind why that person is chosen... That's his point. The award is always a story, but not always a person, hence story of the year is more accurate. I mean, its also a reflection of society itself has changed. Because of how much more connected everyone is and how easy communication has begun, a lot of the bigger achievements are no longer the responsibility of individuals.   In the past, people would act as symbolism for movements. Like a focal point that could be the mouthpiece for everyone. You can listen to one person than individually having to call a million to hear what their frustrations are or organize marches and actions.    Now, everyone can almost have an equal voice and movements are driven by populations. While there were individuals that provided the spark, the Arab Springs were largely influenced by Twitter so much so, that beyond that spark, their influence waned. It became about people.  &gt; a lot of the bigger achievements are no longer the responsibility of individuals.  For this reason, a lot of people want to expand the Nobel Prize to be open to teams rather than just individuals (it currently has a limit of being split between a maximum of 3 people) The cover is Adama Iwu (Activist), Ashley Judd (Actress and the main person to come forward about Weinstein for the NYT article), Taylor Swift (musician), Isabel Pascual (strawberry picker), and Susan Fowler (former Uber engineer).   Edit:  &gt;A young hospital worker who had flown in from Texas completed the circle. She too is a victim of sexual harassment but was there anonymously, she said, as an act of solidarity to represent all those who could not speak out.  That’s the elbow on the right of the cover. I wasn't aware that Ashley Judd was among the harassment accusers. She actually first mentioned it publicly in October 2015. Just don't mention her on the_donald. Take it a step further and just don't mention anything in td. Also don't read anything.  Yesterday I called out a user in there who referred to a group of Somali children as "roaches" that should get "run over". Brought up how liberals will keep calling Trump supporters racist as long as Trump does/says nothing to deter racists like that from joining his ranks.  Got immediately banned for trolling, and my comment ended up with 10x more downvotes than the one saying foreign kids should get run over. Welcome to the proud ranks of r/BannedFromThe_Donald/ Sometimes I go on the_donald after something big happens in the news just to see how they spin it to their favor and laugh at their delusion. I sometimes do that too, but the humour usually leaves me very fast.  It was funny the first 5 or 6 times, now it’s like staring into some post-apocalyptic wonderland.  I could never see the humor.  It is scary how people can process information that way.   “Hahaha, they just blamed a mass shooting on Muslims when it was really a deranged white guy and over 59 people are dead and even more are injured and holy shit the world is a scary place and these insane morons vote.” And it got so much worse once the initial reports came out it wasn't a Muslim but a white guy. Before the shooters name was made public T_D went and blamed some random old guy on the word of /pol/. They then proceeded to post and link to shots of this guys social media including his full name, pictures of him and the pictures and names of his GRANDCHILDREN! Fucking children! It was sick. "RADICAL ISLAMIC TURRRURURUR"  *shooter is white*  "RADICAL ANTIFA FALSE FLAG SOROS TURRRURURURURURURST" I only go there when something hits r/all. There was a post about how child prostitution is legal in california now and they're all LOL WTF CALI LIBERAL SHITHOLE. when in reality its to keep underage people who are trafficked from being criminals.   It's still illegal to hire a prostitute of any age, just not to be one that is underage. The elbow on the cover symbolizes those women who have made accusations but won’t provide their identities.  Today, we are all elbows.   In all seriousness though, good job Time. We are anonymous today but hoping we won't have to be in the future.  That makes more sense.  I thought they just Mike Wazowski'd some poor woman. Don't forget the hospital worker who is just out of frame who even now fears going public will ruin her career/life. How is Rose McGowan not on the cover? Her twitter rants seemed to get the ball rolling on this whole movement.  I'm going to say it was ke$ha who got the ball rolling.  It rolled backwards on top of her, but it did start rolling. Or Courtney Love... who said shit about Weinstein in 2001 and got blacklisted because of it. Her twitter rant was post-NYT article which was Judd She was talking about this years ago and nobody believed her. She's in the article.  They have Judd on the cover representing that area (entertainment) and she was vocal about this earlier as well.  She was also the most prominent to go on the record for the NYT story.  The article was pretty wide including McGowan, Alyssa Milano as well as Terry Crews. My favorite quotes from Taylor Swift's testimony:  * Swift was asked by Mr Mueller’s lawyers if he had groped her more than once. “Other than grabbing my ass against my will, underneath my skirt, and refusing to let go, he did not otherwise touch me inappropriately.”    * “I am not going to allow your client to make me feel like it is in any way my fault because it isn’t.”    * “I’m being blamed for the unfortunate events of his life that are a product of his decisions. Not mine."   When Gabriel McFarland, David Mueller's attorney, tried to take more shots at her...  * “Gabe, this is a photo of him with his hand up my skirt — with his hand on my ass,” she said. “You can ask me a million questions — I’m never going to say anything different. I never have said anything different.”   * When McFarland asked the singer why the front of her skirt did not appear to be lifted in the phone, she said, “Because my ass is located in the back of my body.”    * McFarland also noted that Swift was closer to Mueller’s girlfriend, Shannon Melcher, who also appears in the photo, than him. “Yes, she did not have her hand on my ass,” Swift replied.   And when asked if she criticized her bodyguards for not stepping in sooner...   * [Swift] told Mr Mueller's lawyer she was “critical of [his] client sticking his hand under my skirt and grabbing my a**."       *[For those of you who are unaware, a DJ sued Swift for "ruining his career" after she complained about the groping. In response, she counter-sued him for assault and battery, demanding damages of $1 to make her point.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/taylor-swift-sexual-assault-quotes-denver-david-mueller-testimony-court-jury-a7887471.html)   EDIT; correcting some embarrassing grammatical errors.     EDIT #2; Thanks, and I'm glad y'all enjoyed the comment! I pledge to pay it forward this week, since all humorous Swift quotes aside, harassment of any kind is a serious issue and takes a communal effort to tackle.    If you feel moved to throw in some dollars as well, every little bit counts. Find out where your local organizations are. See what's out there. Check out [RAINN's website](https://rainn.org/) for support lines and suggestions on how to get involved. Sexual violence isn't always "just" a skeezy grope by a frosted tip DJ.    And finally, remember that children are perhaps the most vulnerable in all of this. Child and adolescent boys and girls make up a huge portion of abuse victims. [The website](https://rainn.org/safety-parents)  above has some good talking points if you need help starting the conversation. Tell your daughters that their body is their own, and tell your sons that they can be victims too (and that speaking up doesn't make less manly.)     Edit #3; [source](http://variety.com/2017/biz/news/taylor-swift-accuses-dj-of-grabbing-my-ass-in-court-testimony-1202522506/) for additional quotes  love this quote.  “I’m told it was the most amount of times the word “ass” has ever been said in Colorado Federal Court.”    I love this. I hate the usual phrasing that makes things sound more innocent than they actually are. I'm happy she used normal language to describe it. Yeah, the combination of the deliberate effort to avoid any euphemisms and make sure it sounded vulgar every time, and refusing to ever let him pit any blame.on anyone else, is great. reminds me of that [George Carlin bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuEQixrBKCc) God i miss that old fuck.  And the counter suit of $1.  Thats awesome.  Being a resident of Denver Metro, I've heard a bit about this case. Glad she stood her ground so strong.  The music video for *Look What You Made Me Do* came out right after she won this case, and there's a short clip of her in a tub full of diamonds and jewels, [with a single dollar bill sitting right on top](https://i.imgur.com/TN3sXMd.jpg). Thought it was pretty funny.   That DJ must have gotten so pissed every time he turned the radio on and her voice blasted "Look what you made me do." to him every day. Say what you want about the song itself, that video is just filled to the brim with easter eggs like that, and I find that quite amusing.  If you take the song as tongue-in-cheek rather than dead serious it's actually really fun, imo Eh, she said Blank Space was tongue in cheek, I think this one is a little more serious. The video pitch was "imagine if every ridiculous thing printed about me was true" but the song kinda gets to the point of her frustration with the fickle media/public opinion of her. I suppose I meant more 'intentionally over the top," because yeah it's definitely a serious sentiment. She really does catch a lot of heat, much of it unwarranted, but I also don't think she is gonna put out a hit on anyone. Probably. I was pretty meh about the song until the video. The video is a masterpiece and imo completely saved the song. I was shocked that it was not nominated for the "Best Music Video" Grammy this year Never caught onto that but it's fucking beautiful.  She reveals in the article that he still hasn't paid the dollar yet. Aaaand he hasn’t even given her that $1.  Send him to collections! I'm not a fan of hers, but that is brilliant. Oh shit I totally forgot about that with all the other scandals happening. I was wondering why she was on the list.  &gt;* Swift was asked by Mr Mueller’s lawyers if he had groped her more than once. “Other than grabbing my ass against my will, underneath my skirt, and refusing to let go, he did not otherwise touch me inappropriately.”  For a second there I thought the Russia investigation had taken another unexpected turn...      She also said the courtroom gasped when it was announced she was the one being sued. Like...even the courtroom couldn't believe her assaulter SUED her for speaking up.  My favorite was (when asked why a witness standing in front of her claimed not to have seen the groping), “because my ass is located in the back of my body.” I don't pay attention to Swift at all so I never heard about all this, though I do remember hearing something about her winning a court case for a dollar. That was pretty funny, though now knowing what it was tied to, good for her. This is the first time I've really liked Taylor Swift. I don't know how you feel about Ke$ha but [Swift paid for her legal defense.](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/taylor-swift-donates-250-000-to-kesha-after-court-ruling-20160222)  Made me respect her.  Kesha is lit right now After hearing Praying on the radio I went and listened to her other new stuff. I've always thought she had a great voice but was never a fan of her style. This stuff, though, this stuff I like.  Bob Mueller sure gets around. the dj's name is David Mueller His name is Robert Paulson. Don’t worry bro, I understood your post was a joke. *High fives*  It made me laugh but I was legit wondering why Robert Mueller was questioning Taylor Swift.  Possible Taylor Swift-Russia collision? Tswift and Putin 😍😍😍 Can't wait for that breakup song called Hot Like Polonium [Swift is due to testify next week in a civil case she brought against a former local DJ who is accused of grabbing her butt during a meet-and-greet four years ago. Swift says she’s “never been so sure of anything in her life” that David Mueller intentionally put his hand under her skirt and touched her. Mueller claims he never meant to touch Swift inappropriately when they had their photo taken together at Denver’s Pepsi Center on June 2, 2013.] (https://amp.thedailybeast.com/taylor-swift-finally-faces-down-the-man-she-says-groped-her)  I can never find any reason to dislike Taylor Swift.  Every now and then people say stuff like "she plays like she's a small town girl who made it big, but she comes from money", but that's called playing a character - it's literally what the industry is.     Every non-career thing i've ever seen her say or do has been... pretty remarkably centered.  She must be very humble and level headed to have *that* career and just be a great example for *people* everywhere. I’m not a fan of how she deals with drama but I still really respect what she did here I still can't believe how many stories came out in a month's time. It changed culture forever. Good on all victims for having the courage to speak out. They deserve this honor.  &gt;forever   this is an immortal beast that has been beaten back to its cave.   best case scenario, it'll return after everyone alive today is dead. most likely, it'll come back sooner. there will always be naive, scare, young people who REALLY want to be actors/models/journalists/whatever, and there will always be people rich enough to sweep things under the rug.  I worry all this will do is make the darkness meaner and darker. I don't think people have a real grasp of how much power this beast control.  Much like how we don't understand how much the 1% is? Similar.  Specifically what worries me is when a few people go down then people will think the beast is vanquished and will develop a false sense of security. You're not wrong, but I think what you describe is the necessary step we have to take.  For a start, I don't think it'll make workplace discrimination or sexual discrimination worse, but the actions and stories we hear will get worse. That's because once you scrape away the horrible outer layer, you get to the rotten core. I guarantee the next thing will be the sex slave and pornography rings, the Epsteins and the Savilles of Hollywood.  Secondly, we might push it further underground, but our choice is between taking action, and having to *chase it* when it does dig further, or taking no action.  And thirdly there's no end. We'll eliminate sexual harassment, and then it'll be racism. Then who knows - maybe we can stop judging people for their personal tastes.  But this is life, and improvement, and design - this is social evolution, the march of change. Its always ugly and difficult, but the choice is between doing nothing and going nowhere or fighting to make sure the next generation don't have to put up with the shit you did. &gt;  I guarantee the next thing will be the sex slave and pornography rings, the Epsteins and the Savilles of Hollywood.  I'm not so sre, I was hoping that would have already happened with Spacey molesting a minor, and the whole Corey Feldman, Lindsay Lohan coming out and talking about being molested as children and Elijah Wood talking about sex rings too, but it was swept under the rug and everyone focused on the adults.  I think after a certain point people just don't want to hear about it because it's too terrible to contemplate. If someone comes up to you and starts talking about child sex rings, people's natural instinct is to shrug it off, they don't want to live in a world where that sort of thing happens so they choose not to by ignoring it.  EDIT: Factual accuracy about Elijah Wood Elijah Wood has stated that the predators were real, but he himself was never a victim Not to be picky, and I agree with all you said, but we need to dispel this idea that this happens to "naive, scared, young people" or any other idea that tries to put victims in a specific pattern, specially because it makes precedent for victim blaming. This can and did happen to all kinds of different people, regardless of age, race, sex, class or behaviour. &gt;naive scared young people   &gt;Terry Crews   Yeah I'm with you on this one. Na it's not done. It may be less with famous people because they saw how it can get out and destroy them but sexual assault for the "commoners" won't go away. College, buisness, bar scene, etc will continue to have the same issues (not saying it's everywhere all the time but it's not going to decrease from the current rates) cause sadly if it's not someone everyone knows doing the assaulting it's not going to make news and those women aren't going to feel the support of the whole world backing them up.   People who feel they have power over women are still going to try and take advantage of them. At best they go in hiding for a couple years  Wish it changed our politics forever.  Seems Politicians are immune. I opened two tabs from r/news at the same time, and thought that this was a comment on "Pfizer denies fumes from factory that produces Viagra are arousing town's males." I'm glad to see that I was wrong. They certainly have changed our country and defined a good portion of 2017 in the USA. Good pick TIME. Not even just the USA, it's spread around the world. A lot of stuff has come out about people here in Australia for instance.  I was recently in an African country (being vague on purpose) and it was certainly a topic of convo among my friends who live there. And it was clear that it came up at their work as well, though I don't know at what level of formality. All positive developments in any event.   All change starts with awareness.  &gt;white_genocidist  ..  &gt;I was recently in an African country (being vague on purpose)    um...should...we call someone?  It’s almost as if people everywhere have a deep seated desire for fairness and justice. Maybe there is still hope for the lot of us.  Hope is the thing with feathers – That perches in the soul – And sings the tune without the words – And never stops – at all Hey Emily! I used to say that poem to myself when I was young and being abused. It helped me through some difficult times. I'm not a huge fan of the "group" TIME Person of the Year, but this year they definitely picked the right non-individual  TIME's person of the year is...  You, Again! In one of Carlos Castaneda's curious books, his sorcerer/shaman teach Don Juan has him dress up like a woman for a trip through part of Mexico. They go hitch hiking and after they're picked up, Castaneda starts attracting the men in the group since they believe him to be a woman.  Normally men are not on the receiving end of this attention where man's primal appetite is sniffing around and driving their behavior. With the carnal desires raw and imbalanced enough to forsake nuanced, reciprocal openings up into subtler communication and deeper connection with the woman, it spills out over onto a "casual" predatory behavior, the standard illusions/masks of civilization and control over natural impulses is gone.  After some uncomfortable, threatening time around all these men gawking at him, making small unwanted sexually charged comments, and even touching him, he and Don Juan get dropped off on the side of the road.  Here, Don Juan has Castaneda take the women's clothes off. Castaneda asks what the hell that was about and Don Juan responds by saying he was teaching him what it was like to be a woman. A man's biggest persistent fear is that he will be humiliated, a woman's biggest persistent fear is that she will be raped.  Really inspired to see a culture shift taking place around the treatment of women. Like most sensitization and growth, it is not a comfortable process, and women have generations and generations of suppressed tension--a lot of sadness, grief, anger, rage, resentment, so it will not be a short process either. But it's necessary for our survival, our thriving, and the richness, in every sense of the word, of our society and culture.  if you can't say 'no' then your 'yes' is meaningless, and by supporting courageous women (and men) who have come forward to share their stories we are empowering women everywhere to have a stronger sense of power, dignity, and individual sovereignty and boundaries. Powerful times.  For an unimpressed asshole, that was nice  I can't think of a better pick for this year either.  The more stories of people coming forward, the more strength it will give to those who have been hurt in the past.  TLDR:  - The 'Silence Breakers' who started the #MeToo movement have been named Time 'Person of the Year'   - Last year's winner, President Trump, and China's President Xi Jinping came in second and third place   - Time Editor-in-Chief Edward Felsenthal called the movement 'the fastest moving social change we've seen in decades'   - The announcement was made Wednesday morning on the Today show, exactly a week after co-host Matt Lauer was fired for sexual harassment allegations     4th was Special Counsel Mueller.  5th was Kim Jong-Un.  In case anybody else was interested who filled out the top 5. 6th was Sean Astin for playing Bob in Stranger Things. Bob was too good for this world *Was*? Awh, what the hell, man. 😔 Mueller's got to be a favorite going into 2018, depending on how this investigation turns out. &gt; Last year's winner  It's not an award to be "won". It's being "named" Person of the Year. It's considered the person who has had the most influence for better or ***worse***.  Yeah, people tend to forget that Hitler, Stalin and Komeini were named Person of The Year because they had a huge impact (a negative one but still huge). Also in 2001 Bin Laden was a very likely candidate. It's not an award, not an honor, you don't win anything. It means you were important that year, not that you were a model or a force for good. The fact that Bin Laden didn't get it for 2001 shows how many people don't understand it's not always for the best it could also be for the worst. Pretty sure Time wanted to name him but didn't want to deal with the bullshit backlash. This is bound to influence in more people be comfortable to speak out, so this is a wise decision. I hope you're right, but I actually had the opposite feeling. Like this was the big finale and we're supposed to focus on something else now in 2018. Perhaps it's because we traditionally honor people at the end of things, such as school years, sports seasons, retirement, etc. Maybe. The article suggests this could be just the start, and I hope they're right.  &gt;We are in the middle of the beginning of this upheaval. There is so much that we still don’t know about its ultimate impact. How far-reaching will it be? How deep into the country? How far down the organizational chart? Will there be a backlash? This also makes Terry Crews a Times person of the year. He is included in the photos within the article. About 3/4 of the way through. At least he is on desktop, not sure how it looks on mobile. Yes he is in the cover story. /r/CrewsCrew would be proud :,) They never stopped being proud Can we get Terry to be a mod of /r/wholesomememes ? He's one of the most wholesome celebrities I know. He's also in the video Time produced. Just finished watching the video. I encourage others to watch it, as well. It was very well done, it gave multiple points of view, reasons why this was a slam dunk pick for Time, and packed a lot of information in the 5 minutes that it was shown.  Yep. He's there.  Well its not really shocking that so many sexual predators and sexual harassment happens in hollywood when you take into consideration the rest of the US for both men and women.  * **1 out of 4** Women &amp; **1 out of 10** Men experience one or more incidents of sexual harassment in the workforce in the US.  * **2 out of 3** Women experience one or more incidents of sexual harassment on the street in the US.  * **1 out of 4** Women &amp; **1 out of 16** Men experience one or more incidents of sexual assault in the US.  * **1 out of 6** Women &amp; **1 out of 33** Men experience attempted or completed Rape in their lifetime in the US.  * Out of the 25% of women and 6,3% of Men who experience sexual assault **only 20-30% of them report the assault** to the authorities.  * Out of the cases of sexual assault that are reported to the police, only **,on average, 20% are arrested**, while **only around 5% are prosecuted** and **only on average 3% are incarcerated.**   So this isn't a Hollywood centric issue. Its a world-wide issue in regards to sexual boundaries, respect, victim-shaming and simple concept of consent and ethics. Luckily the amount of rapes in the US has dropped since 1980s by 60%, but the amount of rapes still happening are too high for any society that wants to move forward to a better future.  And This recent examination of the sexual abuse in Hollywood will be a great catalyst towards that future, as per usual a society in which we idolize celebrities, only by humanizing them and seeing them acknowledge the problem, and work to change to fix that problem, will push the society be more open to even accepting that there is a problem that needs to be discussed in the first place.

There was a huge movement in Scandinavia where women in the music industry, like normal people many non-famous, shared their stories about how people around them would sexually assault, harass or at times coerce them into positions they did not want to be in.  There were about 1000 different women who came forward with stories of such incidents. Here are some of them that i translated so people can be aware that these things they dont just happen in far away places, they happen all around us.  **01 of 20** &gt; When I attended music education, we had a small party at school. We were 20 people together and several of our teachers were present. All married men with children.   &gt;On the dance floor, one of them suddenly grabs my hips, turns me around, bends me forward and pretends he penetrates me hard from behind. To the full applause from the other male colleagues, teachers, and in front of all my new friends.   &gt;It was so incredibly embarrassing and disgusting! I said nothing and nobody else said anything.  **02 of 20** &gt; Comment from the 10 years old experienced guys on tour to me about my roommate: "Dont you want to fuck?! You are the only ones in the orchestra we have not fucked yet. "  **03 of 20** &gt;I was a music student and was invited with some other girls to a casting abroad. An influential manager well over the years was holding auditions for a new girl group. The auditions were obviously to be kept at the manager's home, and only he was present.  &gt;He gave us lots of wine and asked us to act flirting so that he could assess if we had "what it takes". He showed us videos of several other girl groups he had worked with, and bragged that he had been with them all. We laughed it off awkwardly and we felt secure as we were a group.  &gt;The next day, for several reasons, I found myself alone with him in his home. He said I was most ready for the group and wanted to see me acting for the part, alone. "Come towards me and be seductive," he said, and I tried to do what he said. Mostly because I felt I owe him since he paid for our entire trip.  &gt;When I walked towards him, he grabbed around my body tight. I tried to say I had a boyfriend and would not do this and tried to wring myself away. but suddenly he stabbed two fingers into me under my skirt, and then everything went completely black.  &gt;I tried to fight it while his cold, old tongue was in my mouth and many other places on my body. My body shut down. I felt I had no choice. He opened his trousers and pushed my hand around his crotch. Only when he pushed my head down there I managed to get loose. He laughed. When I got home, he called me and said I had gotten the job. I could come down for a photo shoot next weekend.  &gt;Of course I did not go. And I never told anyone. It's only now, 15 years later, that I feel I can say that what happened was not my fault.  **04 of 20** &gt;I was 16-17 years old and new in town. I had met a guy, maybe ten years older than me, who liked my music. Big Tall guy. He made sure to arrange a meeting between us so late that I could not go home since I did not live in the city. He poured me a lot of wine.  &gt;I remember him playing loud music he knew I liked. I remember the arm around me while grabbing the sofa and asked "do you find this uncomfortable?" And then just kept holding even harder. If im honest, much of what happened is blurry to me. I remember being pushed to do a bunch of things I did not want, even though I said "no", "stop", "do not do it" and he held me down.  &gt;I did not have the chance. I remember waiting until he fell asleep before I managed to sneak out at 03:30 in the morning, full of shame. I felt filthy and had a mental and physical pain. Got a bunch of "dick pics" afterwards. Felt like vomiting every time I saw the snapchat icon, and he always wanted me to come back. I still blame myself.  **05 of 20**  &gt;I played at a festival, we were five girls in the early 20's.  &gt;A guy of approx. 40 who was a longtime crew member for a famous band did a series of inappropriate approaches. He entered the backstage, took off his upper body and asked for massage. We shook our head and laughed at first, and did not know if he was serious.  &gt;He hung around and finally asked if one of us could have sex with him for 5000 kr. We told the band he worked for about this right afterwards, and they seemed "tired" and answered something like "ffs, not again, he's just a bit hopeless."  &gt;That stopped that thing.  **06 of 20** &gt;At the concert. At the back in the corner of the venue. Full. Cramped with an audience. Good atmosphere.  &gt;Industry colleague says, "Can you hold my beer?"  &gt;And when I had a beer in each hand, he puts his hand in my crotch and gives me a look like saying, "What are you doing now?".  &gt;I was almost about to break both beer bottles on his face.  **07 of 20** &gt;My first encounter with the industry was when I played in a band with a bunch of elderly men who have been active musicians since I was born. I was 23. One of them was constantly on me.  &gt;One of the others flirted with me also, but he probably used it most to position himself in relation to me. Flirting usually occurred in front of other people, for example, that he whistled on me when I had changed my dress. It all peaked when we were behind the stage at a larger festival, and he lifted up my skirt and showed my ass to everyone who was there.  &gt;When I confronted him with it just after, he just said, "You should have to be able to handle that."  **08 of 20**  &gt;I had just gotten to know a much older man in the music environment I'm a part of. One night we had met outside and was on our way home, he invited me to his place. I joined, we talked a little and went to bed since it was late. I was not interested in anything, slept fully dressed and went home the following day. Okay.  &gt;A few days later we agreed to meet. I came and he took me out to a restaurant, something I had not expected. I was nevertheless flattered and thought it was just nice. Afterwards we went home to him and talked and played music. He talked a lot about a musical project he wanted me to join, showed me the songs and wanted me to learn them.  &gt;Occasionally he came with physical approaches, which I carefully rejected. Eventually he became very upset and fussy and began to "shame" me. Because I had already slept with him without sleeping with him. Because I said I liked him, but did not want to have sex with him. He even used the fact that I had had some partners before, against me. Why should not I have sex with him then?  &gt;In the end, I felt so guilty, and in addition, I was greatly intoxicated that I gave up to his pressures and just lied down and let him do his thing. There and then, I was just glad he finished fast.  **09 of 20**  &gt;A couple of years ago I participated in a project. I was in a group with a producer I admired, and two other men whom I knew and liked. The time was approx. 11 in the day, and the producer already started to get quite drunk. We started anyway.  &gt;A few hours later it became clear that it was not possible to continue and that the producer just focused on me alone in the room. He became obsessed completely about my ass, and made comments about it all the time. I started to get pretty angry, the others had also asked him to stop several times.  &gt;The episode culminated that he laid down on the floor like a three-year-old in a fit and shouted repeatedly: "I wanna fuck you in the ass." Just then more people came into the room, and my humiliation felt quite complete.  &gt;Nobody did anything, they just walked out. Later I went to the management and said that I demanded that the person should be fired. Then I was told that he was too talented to let go and that he had some alcohol problems.  **10 of 20**  &gt;After finishing work at an industry festival, I stood at the bar in the main tent waiting to order myself a beer. A  festival colleague from another festival comes up behind me, "locks" me in by putting my arms on each side of me and thrusting at me three to four times hard against the bar counter before im able to push him away.  &gt;He breaks out: "Oh, you just do something to me."  **11 of 20** &gt;My worst incident was when I, as a young new orchestra musician, went out for a concert.  &gt;Because it was late, I got an offer to sleep with an older colleague who lives nearby. "No, you can sleep on the couch, so you do not have to spend money on a taxi home!" he said.  &gt;When we enter the door of his place, he changed his behavior. Wanted to kiss me and started touching me. I wasnt sober, but I did definitely say no and walked away from him. He didnt stop, started nagging, I moved away again, he moved towards me again. I didnt want to get mad and create a bad mood, since I felt he has the power over my future career. I said I'm tired and ask if I can sleep.  &gt;There was of course no couch as he offered, just a double bed. I emphasized that I just wanted to sleep, turn away, say "no, I do not want to," but he continues nagging, continues to touch me. In the end, I just let him do what he wanted, avoiding eye contact and felt that this was my fault that I was stupid enough to get drunk and unable to get out of the situation.  &gt;The next morning I tried to get out as soon as possible, but he insisted on chatting. I explain that what happened the day before was not something I wanted. that it felt bad and that I felt I clearly said no to his advances, but that he did not stop. He starts trying to persuade me that "we were having a nice time" and start touching me up again.  Continued below.  That was horrible to read. Fuck this is all so depressing. Continued from above.  **12 of 20**  &gt; Like many others, I've almost played exclusively with men whom I looked at as my closest friends and I feel safe with. One thing that I have struggled with, however, is the assumption that my male bandmates "own me" and that I am safe in performances and on tour just because I'm always surrounded by a crew with men.  &gt;On several occasions, since we were very young, my male colleagues have been asked, "who is having sex with me,". As if I belong to one of my male colleagues. After our first festival job, one of my bandmates was warned by someone that he had to tell me to watch out because "his friend had a big desire to fuck me" words I have not forgotten since.  **13 of 20** &gt; I had said loud and clear about what I mean about a matter in a joint meeting at a festival I was working with. Festive co-worker then comes up behind me and whispers me in my ear: "I get so hard when you're strict." I say nothing.  **14 of 20** &gt;In Oslo, I was subjected to an assault by someone I had a thing with. I have the same idea as others that this is something everyone has been through before, it is not worth doing anything about.  &gt;I remember going home with my panties in the bag, the one he teared when he ripped it off me                 while holding me down and I thought it was not worth it to fight it. That the music environment he was in, his crew, was going to make trouble for me. I wouldn't get any more gigs. So I did nothing.  &gt;A year later he contacted me. I rejected talking to him on a message. He called. We had a long conversation. And he apologized very much.  **15 of 20**  &gt; I was in my 20's and was working as a district musician right after my studies. I stayed in a place by myself and one evening someone knocked on the door. One of the older musicians came to visit. It was a little weird, but also nice since I did not know so many people there.  &gt;I remember that I was walking barefoot and that the ragsocks hung on the radiator in the living room because I had been outside in the snow. Suddenly he comes to me, clinging to me and saying that I should not be afraid. But that he likes small tits.  &gt; He rubs up on me. I'm saying stop, but he answers that I was the one who wanted it. I finally get loose and says he has to go, he reluctantly goes to the door and I get him out and lock the door. I cant call anyone.  &gt;Later, after a big band practice, he followed me in a car, saying, I was tempting him since I was barefoot. That I was walking across the line.  **16 of 20**  &gt; I had responded to an advertisement for a production where they had asked for pictures. A few weeks later, I received a private mail from one of the producers who wrote that he was new and needed human contact.  &gt;He could offer me 3000 kr per time we met, and could guarantee that it would be quickly over.  **17 of 20**  &gt; I was 17 years old and had contact with someone who could take promo shots for my first solo concert. He was a hobby photographer, but I had seen some of his work and liked his work. He said he could take the pictures for free. He had a studio at his house, and after first meeting at the cafe and planning the photography, I went there.  &gt;We started the photography as planned. He constantly commented on my body, and thought the photos could became better, "more wounded and more intimate", if I bare my shoulders. I took off my sweater and pulled my dress strap down my shoulders. "Bare back," he said, and wanted that I take off of the clothes from my upper body.  &gt;I stood there in tights and felt that this did not represent my music, but still thought he knew best. Eventually he took the memory card from the camera and put it on the PC and asked me to come and sit. He pulled me closer to him and let his hand lie around my midriff. He flips through the pictures and says "look so nice you are", pointing to his pants and an obviously erect penis.  &gt;I didnt dare to move, and the hand he has around my midriff glides under my skirt and my tights. He continues to scroll through the pictures with a hand in my underwear. With a little miracle, my phone rings that is in my bag a little bit away, and I finally get the chance to save myself out from his grip. I lied and said it's mom asking me to come home right away.  &gt;All the way home, I cried. I was 17. And I was left with the feeling that I should have known better.  **18 of 20**  &gt;Lost a job on a choir for a album because I would not "kneel down and work for it". The producer demanded that I should suck him off! When I became angry and said I would rather wash the toilets at the train station with my tongue than doing it, he said he would destroy my name in the industry. I stormed out and cried in the car afterwards.  **19 of 20**  &gt;This week it's been two years since my life's worst night.  &gt;I celebrated my birthday out and accidentally met more friends. Among them a acquaintance for many years, who worked in the music industry. It was a good mood, we ended up with a group and later went home with him. I wanted to come home with him and wanted to have sex with him.  &gt;However, quite soon as we entered his place he changed completely and became angry and violent. The more I resisted, the more aggressive he became. In the end I gave up, turned off my mind and let the body go limp. When I went home the day after, I was full of bruises and scrubmarks.  &gt;I felt a lot of guilt, I did want to go home with him. I doubted my own judgment. It was not possible for me to report it to the police, but I thankfully changed my mind after six months. Later it turned out that he was previously convicted of violence. Nevertheless, the police used more than a year to question him. I'm still waiting for the case to be taken or to know if the case is being rejected.  **20 of 20**  &gt; I was invited home to the boss after a production. I was pleased and full of good experiences.  &gt;When the taxi stopped at his place, I wondered why it was just him and me there, that was not the deal. But I joined. Inside the house, he jumps on me before I can do anything. My reaction was, of course, to resist everything i could while my heart was all the way up my throat and my hands and legs trembling.  &gt;He did not care and tried to tear off my clothes while he also had a grip on my hair that I felt like was going to tear out with the scalp.  &gt;I do not know what happened to me other than that fear went over to a terrible anger that ended up with me getting some punches in that almost knocked him out. The last thing I saw was that he lay on the floor between the coffee table and the sofa completely knocked out. I'm grabbed my things and ran out. Then came the reaction: I began to tremble. When I got home I saw that I had marks and wounds all over my body, neck and head.  &gt;After this, I did not get any more jobs from him or his colleagues.    So i just wanted to post these to kind of bring attention to what everyday people go through some times. These arent celebs or public people, these are just normal people that have such experiences once or more in their lives. There were about 1000 more stories like these posted but these were the ones publicized in a news article . [Source here:](https://www.aftenposten.no/kultur/i/qnp89z/narmusikkenstilner-Plutselig-stakk-han-to-fingre-inn-i-meg-under-skjortet-mitt)  Sexual harassment and sexual assault is something that needs to be acknowledged and discussed, its been with us with our cultures around the world since the beginning, and the only way to move forward to a better place is to acknowledge it and talk about it more than just when some brown people or immigrants are involved. there was a story i saw on twitter about a woman who was visited in the hospital by police who harrassed her for reporting a policeman that raped her.  and people wonder why women don't report rape. I reported my rape to a *female* police officer, within 12 hours of it happening, with physical evidence (bruising and bleeding), and text messages from the guy admitting that he knew I didn’t consent. She implied that it was my fault and told me there was nothing the police could do. I’d never felt so ashamed and broken and helpless in my life. I saw an attorney about a civil suit, but didn’t have the mental strength to go through a trial.    Instead I went through two years of therapy, nightmares, panic attacks, parental rejection, losing my best friend, my work suffering, etc. The turning point was getting a dog who I’m pretty sure would lay down her life for me. She sleeps next to me every night and will wake me up if I start to get agitated in my sleep, will press her body against me and nudge my hand at the onset of a panic attack (often before I even realize one is starting), and is protective of me when strange men approach us in public (not biting, but will give a little warning growl).    I’m no longer afraid and feel like my old self. I still occasionally think about that female police officer, and how terribly broken our justice system is. I feel for all the people out there who have experienced the same hurt and not received justice. Yeah people are always like why do these people not speak up earlier?  without realizing the only people you can talk to are the police who regularly kill black dudes for no reason.  it's a fucking terrible system. I'm so sorry you went through that. The lack of support people receive from our law enforcement and our peers is heartbreaking. It doesn't matter if somebody walks down the street naked, nobody gets to touch them without their consent.  he talked about how all the women coming out helped him come to terms and speak out. Glad they got him into the article. The whole metoo has been powerful for a lot of people.  He publicly identifies as a feminist. I wonder how many of the menn on here identify as feminists. I do. If you're for equal treatment of women then you are a feminist. It's a tragedy that people can fall into a trap that feminism somehow means women ruling over men like a tribe of Amazonian women. For simply talking about equality I grew up bring called a femnazi by a male relative.  He still uses that term to this day. Oh, you weren’t aware that seeking equality for women was fundamentally the same thing as murdering 10 million people in cold blood? Me too. I came to the conclusion that the definition and reality of feminism is vastly different in Reddit and in real life. Which is why he's featured in the article. He's in the article, he posed for a photo Hundreds of thousands of women, and the top comment is about one of the few men... "The Silence Breakers" sounds like an EDM group. Or a game of thrones sellsword company. Or professional torturers.  My first reaction was "I haven't heard their album yet".  Justice rains from above. *Justice rains fro-AAAAAAAGHHHHH The most accurate version of the quote Overwatch saved us with their vision of a more equal future, and that future is being realized as we speak. Now all we have to do is prevent the robot genocide.  You're powered up, get in there! Kind of sucks for all those people that broke the silence for decades and were shunned, ridiculed and even attacked. That's exactly why this movement is important . Because it helps change that response.  It's almost as if there's a large portion of the population that's been actively trying to silence those women, and - maybe in the last year or so? - they somehow lost all credibility with the rest of us. Better late than never on this one. Let's sort by controversial... DONT DO IT. I barely got out alive. Might want to do a quick check for cancer. “What had manifested as shame exploded into outrage. Fear became fury.” This puts Donald Trumps tweet about saying no to Times's person of the year into an especially cringey light. unfortunately I'm numb to anything he does anymore Now I understand why he thought he would be named again this year. Time probably called him for a comment because they were doing Person of the Year focusing on all the sexual harassment stories. He thought he was a sure thing. Today he probably saw the cover and thought “Ohhhh, they meant the *victims*.” This is perfect. I'm picturing him in his desk right now just fuming. "Hey but I'M the one doing things, they just had to have it done to them. I'm the real doer here. Should be my face!" I'm a dude. I gotta admit, the MeToo thing really shook me up. I was half on the notallmen bandwagon. I knew men could act like complete slime to women but it couldn't be that widespread, right? I was thinking from my own POV. I'm not a woman. Once I saw all of the testimonies of my freinds on Facebook and other media about how they've been harassed at some point in their lives, it crashed home to me that I was pretty insulated and the problem is widespread.  So, it isn't every last man, but it is far too many. What women and all those willing to speak up against abuse have done this year is shedding light on the problems that still exist in our society. Yes, we don't want to look at it. Yes, we'll try to rationalize it away. Yes, it will take a very long time to fix this. The conversation has started and it's time to start listening and considering viewpoints outside your own. This is a very worthy Person of the Year cover. The fact that we as men could be so unaware of the extent of the problem is a problem in itself. It speaks to a larger issue of discounting victims, especially when they're of a different race or gender. But it's never too late to become more empathetic and more trusting of the idea that other people have experiences that we can't fully understand since they differ so dramatically from our own.  I think it also speaks to how much things that are **totally normal** for some are a **complete surprise** to others. We don't actually have common realities, even in the same place. Absolutely correct. I've always discounted these stories subconsciously... The scope of this is incredibly enlightening.  It's crazy that something that would never even cross the mind of an average man is so prevalent.  To me, it's because it doesn't happen to men anywhere near as much. Hard to feel the reality of something that is happening to others when it isn't happening to yourself. It's good to hear the stories of others. There'd be know way of knowing otherwise. Reddit usually has an incredibly negative gut reaction to the term "privilege," but this is exactly what it is talking about. Your place in life can insulate you entirely from many issues and that doesn't mean that they aren't real issues.  A girl I knew over skype in 10th grade was raped by one of her friends. She called me absolutely bawling, and wouldn't stop crying for weeks. After she was done crying, she was a shell of her former self. I couldn't talk to her anymore ( I had problems with depression in 10th grade, hormones were not kind to my brain) she was making me want to kill myself. I don't have to a point to sharing this, just like her being raped didn't have a point. She never got any meaningful answer as to "why" beyond he thought she was attractive and he decided to ruin their friendship and her life.  On a related note, I was "raped" (coerced) by a former girlfriend in high school. I had asked for her help on a class project, and after we were finished she said she would tell the teacher if we didn't do it. At the time it felt a bit slimy cause I really didn't want to, but I am alright now without any trust issues. I don't know why I am sharing, I feel compelled to by your comment. thanks for sharing. we carry these traumas with us (our own and those of loved ones, which we consider our own in a sense) and the only resolution is to bring them to light.  That hits the nail on the head. I have two older sisters, both of whom are objectively better than me in most ways. Financial stability, work ethic, ease of grasping in concepts, empathy, throwing a football— you name it.   Both of them posted in the #MeToo campaign and it blindsided me. One was groped while working in a school; the other was pinned to a wall by a coworker and not allowed to leave until she kissed him.   The gut reaction— especially when it’s family— is to want to enact a violent revenge on those responsible. I won’t pretend that isn’t still on my list of things I’d love to do to those pieces of slime. But it isn’t going to solve the underlying problem— a system where men— *married* men in the case of my sisters— feel that it is at all acceptable to behave in such ways and to try to take what they want from another human being.  I am a woman and you two men just made me cry.   You listened.  You heard.    Now, please,  speak up when you see it happening.  Call out people who engage in this behavior and take the next step in being part of the solution.   And please accept my heartfelt gratitude!    Same here. I really needed to see this today. I can't count on the men in my life to get it so even coming across strangers who do has made me weep repeatedly.  Honestly, it shocks me more that there were so many men who were unaware of the problem. I am a woman, but I've grown up my whole life knowing about the problem even if nothing as terrible has happened to me.   I've learned about it in school several times. I feel like the information has always been online. Why do you think you believe it now and not before? Or had you literally never heard of it before? Last week's SNL sketch "Welcome To Hell" was a great (and morbidly funny) take on this.   I think as long as it wasn't personal for a lot of men, they could ignore it. It's similar to the movement to get gay people to come out. It's a lot harder to ignore something when it personally affects you. Making everyone realize they knew and loved at least one gay person did a lot for changing opinions on gay rights. Making every last man confront the fact that almost every woman they know was harassed/abused at some point really made the issue personal.   The girl I dated in college had been raped in high school. She confided that in me, and it made the issue personal. I don't think I knew or cared as much about it before I knew someone who had been so affected. Since then, I've been well aware of how women are treated on a daily basis. But without that earlier experience, it's hard for me to say I would have felt the same.  Basically, it's easy to ignore something that doesn't affect you. It amazes me that we are so divided on these accusations. Every day I listen to someone at work saying that these people should've come forward sooner, that they just want a hand out, that they can't prove any of this so why does it matter.   If you haven't, watch "The Keepers" on Netflix. It's an interesting look into the victims of sexual assault who "we're old enough to know better," and "should've said something sooner."   I know there are people who will jump on the bandwagon for their own profit, but we can't dismiss all these accusations just because of a few.  What blows my mind is people don't seem to understand that when they yell "why didn't they come out sooner, they must just want a handout", they are the reason that victims don't come forward sooner.  When your first response is to question the motives of the person coming forward, and to question the timing, you're contributing to the culture that prevents victims from coming forward. Great choice, this is a watershed moment but I feel the actual cover itself is done poorly. More people should have been included and specifically I feel Rose McGowan deserved a spot on the visible cover. (I haven't seen the fold yet).  The cover is Adama Iwu, Ashley Judd, Taylor Swift, Isabel Pascual, and Susan Fowler. They represent activism/politics, Hollywood, the music industry, working class/manual labor, and STEM.  Judd was the main victim in the NYT article about Weinstein which is probably why she’s there over McGowan - who is the header of the online article. It's only a matter of time until Trump tweets that he's a silence breaker. He's going to claim Obama touched his boob. Good. They've had a huge impact this year. It's still not over but less and less people are being afraid to speak out.   They've been very brave and courageous. Especially in this cultural and political climate where someone who said the following could become President:  &gt;I did try and fuck her. She was married. I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn’t get there. And she was married. Then all of a sudden I see her, she’s now got the big phony tits and everything. She’s totally changed her look. I’ve gotta use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her. You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. When you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything... Grab 'em by the pussy. You can do anything.  &gt;	Donald Trump to Billy Bush in 2005; "Transcript: Donald Trump's Taped Comments About Women", The New York Times (8 October 2016) Well deserved. Also mad respect for Terry Crews Why is support for Crews on reddit so disproportionate to everyone else?  He’s highlighted in the article among many more victims  not on the cover FYI. Because he's a male victim of this horror.  It's also why you don't see comments about how his abuser is innocent until proven guilty or how it's scary that Terry can just ruin his life around. Exactly. I think Terry Crews is a fantastic and brave person, I have nothing but respect for him and I'm so glad he shared his story and is being heard. Especially since he is black, physically strong, and doesn't fit the typical profile of a sexual assault victim, I think his voice is so important. Male victims are just as important as female victims and they aren't treated that way most of the time and that needs to stop.   That being said, the lack of "innocent until proven guilty" comments and comments about how it's a shame that someone's career was ruined because of a tweet were apparent to me as well. But with the lack of respect male victims are often shown, I understand why male-majority Reddit was glad to see a man coming forward getting media attention. I don't really blame them but the attitude difference is noticeable for sure. Exactly, people can try to deny it. Yet, when the Erin Andrews and Hulk Hogan privacy invasion cases came out shortly after each other I remember most comments on reddit about Erin said things like, "Fuck her she didn't even look good naked anyway." And, "That bitch just wants people to feel sorry for her, she's so desperate for attention."  However when it was Hulk most comments said things like, "Yeah, I hope Hulk destroys them!" And, "He didn't deserve to have his privacy invaded."   He's a dude. That's why.  Because he's posted on Reddit several times in the past, is in some movies and TV shows a lot of people on Reddit like, and does some videogames stuff.  So he hits Reddit's demographics perfectly. While true, the more serious answer is that there was growing contentment in some of Hollywood elite that Crews is a physically strong, straight, black man who can't be sexually assaulted.  Apparently only women can be sexually harassed which is ungodly false.  Anyone can be.   Edit:  here is a recent example with [Wendy Williams](https://youtu.be/pi0ePRY7TSc?t=3m54s) on how shitty she was with Crews's response.  My apologies for those who have to see a Wendy Williams video. I think it also highlights the fact that most of the assault was accomplished because of power in the industry rather than strength and physical imposition. That's an important detail to keep in mind if you want to seek change.   Crews fits the bill as there is no denying that industry power was the key in creating that type of culture  Absolutely because it shattered the image that a physically strong man is immune from sexual harassment.  Caught many people off guard and I am glad it did.  Crews and James Van Der Beek took big gambles and won many people over (as well am many women who started this forest fire of change). And Anthony Rapp for calling out Spacey.
 Once again, an absolutely shitty headline, with no basis in fact. Media representation about developments in genetic research is generally some of the worst reporting out there. At least this article seems to cover, quite clearly and simply, the observations made and importantly *what they mean*. At least this headline wasn't something like "Science Discover's the **GAY GENE**" (just wait someone will report this like that) &gt;“Even if a gene variant does show some correlation with sexual orientation, this does not mean that the gene is in any way responsible for being gay – it just means it has some association with a trait that is more likely to found in the relatively few people involved as subjects in the study.  &gt;“This could be better social awareness or being brave enough to acknowledge that they are in a minority.”  Article also says that the study is based on subjects self reporting that they are gay. So the gene may not in anyway be linked to homosexuality; however those with the gene and thous who are homosexual may just have a higher confidence level to accept and/or report that they are gay.  &gt;“I can see no major implications of this work or how it could be useful in the future.    &gt;“The genetic effects are far too weak to be of any predictive or diagnostic value.  All biology – including the origins of sexuality – is interesting at some level, but I see no direct applications of such research.” &gt; “The genetic effects are far too weak to be of any predictive or diagnostic value.  All biology – including the origins of sexuality – is interesting at some level, but I see no direct applications of such research.”  The middle-east and north Africa "gay testers" disagree /s Combined with this: https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/dec/04/us-military-agency-invests-100m-in-genetic-extinction-technologies  things could get very ugly. Fun observation: SLITRK6, the gene they talk about which control brain development to areas like the hypothalamus (which regulates sex drive and might influence the "gay gene")  Rearrange the words SLITRK6 to form the word : KLITRS 6, or clitoris sex. Those scientists with their clever naming lol.   Also, is there really a gay gene? Is it all genetic? I have always assumed it was a bit of both, nature plus nurture. I think influences in childhood always have a big role in shaping your adult life. Lots of peoples sexual fetishes are cause of stuff they encountered growing up (like watching old movies giving someone a fetish for women with pantyhose). I assume sexual preference is related to this as well.   Sexual orientation is mainly genetic with your environment and experience altering your preferences.  Unless you were already bi, it's difficult to imagine an environment that would make a straight person act gay or vice-versa unless the feel the need to hide themselves due to societal repurcussions but the false life doesn't override their actual sexual orientation. At least one [Gene linked to homosexual desire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayu2XZ-mFGw) has been known since the mid-1980s; it's regarded as benign if not outright beneficial. It was a pretty big discovery for a lot of teens back then. It is good to read the article and the article link to another article.  Otherwise you will think that "Genes linked to homosexuality discovered by scientists", which is not at all the case.  Always read before you sign up. They might find more then they are expecting in those genes.  So...one more thing we can blame on our parents?  I'm no genealogist but I'm pretty sure there is way more we don't know about gene functions than that we do. Also, I am a human being and find every person I meet to be a fascinating combination of environmental, genetic, and cultural experiences. I'm glad I have the male pattern baldness gene. I can't imagine carrying the shame of all the hair styles I would have sported over the years. These people ought to get more funding. And sandwiches. Okay, but can you find the gene link to super successful people like Bill Gates? Just so I can line up the right wife to make a super baby so my retirement plan can be handled by my child. Thanks. well, insure that they have good cognitive abilities.  i think this is a good way to explain. genes are our foundation, environment is the house and yard, experience is everything else.    &gt; Okay, but can you find the gene link to super successful people like Bill Gates?  What is the genetic basis for high-functioning sociopathy?  https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/21/apparently-psychopaths-make-good-ceos.html  https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/15/silicon-valley-psychopath-ceo-sxsw-panel  http://www.businessinsider.com/ceos-often-have-psychopathic-traits-2017-7  https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2011/06/14/why-some-psychopaths-make-great-ceos/#38ab4f97261a high-functioning psychopathy** Hopefully they discover a way to screen it like downs. Annnnnd... yup, a Trumptard poster. Guess it’s too late to screen for that.
 I’d be interested in an investigation on Reddit. A news outlet gets a large amount of traffic if their story reaches the front page. Sensationalized headlines help push these stories to the top.  I'm sure reddit, as with all other major social media players, has major issues with bots that they are choosing to not reveal because it boosts their value as a company. That said I think it's pretty clear Twitter is the worst of all the platforms in that regard As far as we know, Twitter is the worst because it’s in the limelight. I fear reddit may be worse because it’s a more effective tool to spread misinformation.  Yeah, I cant say about Twitter vs Reddit but this place has gotten very bad in that regard over the last year. it's pretty blatant now and almost nobody realizes or cares it's really getting out of control.. i mean it used to be that people would mock the idea of bots but now it's just a commonly accepted fact.  i've even gone through peoples comment history and found out that their account exists solely for pushing some sort of agenda. i mean for sure it's not ALWAYS a bot but four years ago there weren't nearly as many accounts DEDICATED to derailing political discussions. And in subs such as /r/politics if you call someone a bot or troll you'll get banned. because its as a worthless statement. You are almost certainly wrong in your accusation, and if even you are correct, your accusation does nothing to discredit what the troll or bot says.  People need to cease falling back on the 'troll' and 'bot' accusations and accept that there are people in the world that genuinely disagree with them and that doesn't make that person a bad person. Twitter has a MASSIVE problem with this. Both sides under say, a Trump tweet, tweet nothing but propaganda and insults - almost always not even related to Trump's original tweet. They both tweet utter garbage and are in turn both called bots by the other side.  Its laughable. Ehhh there are a ton of opinions that I believe make you a bad person. and just as it is their right to have those opinions, it is my right to have my opinion of them.  It shouldn't be a banworthy offense to actually call out suspicious behavior, though.    And you're slightly underselling the prevalence of botting, trolling, and brigading.  It's not some freaky rare occurrence to find an account with a stock username, created 9 months ago but only active in the last few days, whose only comments defend Russia or Trump in barely-passable English (or completely irrelevant stock replies).    I've seen it personally 3 or 4 times for certain, suspect a few more, and I've only been here for a few months. I am not a bot, I live in NZ and I am critical of my own government and others.   If I write something critical of the US government, I am accused of being a Russian bot. I am never accused of being an American bot if I write something critical of Russia or China which I find very strange. There is no doubt in my mind that all of these countries are active in this manner.   I genuinely appreciate it when I am corrected or better informed on a subject, I have grown to appreciate just how vast the collective knowledge of Reddit is.   I really don't know what people are trying to achieve when accusing someone of being a bot, rather than responding to their statement. I know they don't genuinely think I'm a bot, but for some reason they think that by accusing me of being one, they are discrediting my argument. I really think it is a sign of a seriously dangerous mindset and as it really dous not add anything to the discussion, I feel like they should be banned. Bit of you call someone a nazi right winger you'll get gilded  The rare double typo? You don't see many of these in the wild I care. What can I do to help minimize the spread of misinformation? Try to think critically about things and not only source them but think about the credibility and potential biases of the source. In the context of Reddit this means especially don't take headline's word for anything, or commenters claims. Unfortunately this doesn't do much overall when 95% of other people don't care People care but what are you going to do when even the CEO admits to manipulating user comments? Twitter may be the worst but you should know what you're getting into. Facebook is the worst because of the stupid trust levels people have with it Also the amount of stupid people’s comments on Facebook who also happen to receive the most amount of likes for some reason. Like ridiculously stupid, illogical but dead serious comments (mainly of outrage)  And now they have it so the comment with the most replies rises to the top. This means that the top comment is usually gonna be some antagonistic/trolling/divisive comment, because people will be arguing against it.   It really helps to spread misinformation even more, because it gets people who have no idea what they're talking about more engaged in the comments, which I'm sure only helps Facebook's bottom line. Reddit is an effective tool because very few people read past the headline. There is also a large number of people that jump to the comments to figure out what they "should" think about a certain topic.  I don't know how they compare relatively, but Reddit is rife with social media bots or people. It's easy to identify the ones working for news orgs, because they simply link to their organization's webpage.   r u bots are a lot harder to find because you have to recognize their speech patterns. It's like when an English or Scottish accent comes through. They usually have call to actions and a very strong opinion. Sometimes they crosspost both sides on one account, through I've been seeing that less.  The platform that's most concerning is Facebook. I've heard a lot of people spouting a lot of views that seem to be more in line with foreign viewpoints than domestic. That's where I think trolls are reaching the most people. I was gonna make a comment about how twitter has more active users, but to my surprise it doesn’t. Reddit has nearly 100 million more monthly active users than twitter. So twitter doesn’t even have that excuse. Yeah reddit isn’t perfect on that regard, but it’s obviously not nearly as much of an issue as no fuss was raised about it. Hell, I’ve never been contacted or replied to by a bot on here but nearly once a week I get spam messages and replies from bots on twitter.  &gt; That said I think it's pretty clear Twitter is the worst of all the platforms in that regard  I have a feeling Facebook would give them a run for their money. I agree. Twitter is full of, and expected to be full of, banality. Facebook is where people are deceived the most People always forget, Reddit started off with the founders populating the boards and threads under various usernames and simulating discussions. Fake accounts are actually of feature of Reddit &gt; I'm sure reddit, as with all other major social media players, has major issues with bots that they are choosing to not reveal because it boosts their value as a company. That said I think it's pretty clear Twitter is the worst of all the platforms in that regard  Issues? Reddit admins literally allowed David Brock and "Media Matters", "Correct the Record" and "Shareblue" to brigade subs during and after the 2016 election.   Heres one of the leaked chat logs showing Reddit admins discussing this very thing..   https://i.redd.it/n6o0e35sn5gy.png  So ya. Lets not act like its *just* the Russian state doing the bot brigading. Its very likely and plausible all kinds of groups are using the same Russian bots to peddle their own narrative and influence. Its fact (as per the linked image above) that left wing groups are using bot voting to manipulate Reddit.   Just look at the echo chamber that use to discuss politics. Its ridiculous.    Reddit is even more fucked.  People astroturfing everywhere, companies pushing their agenda, news sites botting their articles on here to get views, and oblivious people parroting talking points. Couldn't agree more. As soon as someone successfully astroturfs some position, the reddit hivemind spreads the misinformation everywhere, through real people.  Then you get real people expressing "their opinion" who are told they are shills, which they aren't. They're carriers for this minsinformation virus.  And because of how our minds work, we're so susceptible to thinking we "know" a fact just because we saw it. And we love parroting it on Reddit. The chances of any user being a carrier of some sort of intentional misinformation nears 100%.  Yeah, Reddit is the ideal platform for astroturfing. It could be worse here than twitter, since we're so enamored with sharing what we think is our sincere opinion, rather than just retweeing something that might later be provably false. This is the site that is now infamous for its hivemind "finding" the boston bomber, when in reality is blamed a kid who was already dead, regardless of what the authorities said.    Sure there are smart minds on reddit, and while it is clear that bots or dedicated trolls / influencers exist, i do not discount the high probability that many of the claims of shills are coming from people who bought into the same hivemind as the boston bomber period, where they think they are too smart to fall for traps.     The main thought that brings me to this is how we see so many posts claiming to call out "Russian trolls", or how to spot a "russian troll", when we have instances where the accounts making these claims conform to the same definition they give as a "Russian troll".    Honestly, if I was a russian troll, then there would be no point shilling pro russia or topics that Russian trolls are associated with as it is too easy to be called out, alongside having plenty of people to hold that position.    The easiest position to manipulate and exploit right now is the mindset of many posters who think that they are immune to russian trolls and therefore blindly believe anybody else who also is opposed to Russian trolls. To me it comes down to: Do I waste my time shilling to people who already side with me, or do I spend my time fucking with people who are trying to call out people like me, but will believe any insane bullshit i feed them as they think i am on *their side*. As a consequence, the people who think they are too smart to be tricked by trolls end up pushing those in the middle away with the insane belief that russian trolls and shills are everywhere so end up accusing innocents of being trolls when in reality the trolls are pushing them into a further radicalized mindset.     Fuck knows though. We are all easily victims of astroturfing, I am not a smart man, so even I've fallen victim to believing complete bollocks before. The one thing I do know, however, is trolling in the 2004-2007 era of 4chan, and how it was easiest to fuck with online communities by not shilling against them but by acting as a radical member and further radicalizing them internally. They won't be convinced to agree with my original point of view, but their radicalized point of view can push others away from agreeing with them, alongside the paranoia making them oblivious to bullshit being fed to their side. I mean, I'm not some master troll, but I knew that it was easier to fuck with people and get them all angry by being on their side and making them get to the point where they lose their shit at anybody who doesn't automatically agree with them than it is to disagree in the first place in an attempt to make them angry.  Yup. Reddit is the worst. It's changed me for the worst. I've never hated people so much but I don't even know if the shit I read is even being said by real people. Some of the guys I know who use reddit a lot are way more sexist than they ever have been. It has really fucked people in the head.   I think the informational subreddits are still very helpful. I mostly use reddit to find programming tutorials. Most news on here is about America anyways, and the entertainment subreddits are getting flooded by companies shelling out their products. I'm not really sure what sexist stuff you're talking about though, the only cesspool I was aware of was incels. Exactly. I love r/fitness, a small game forum: r/tagpro, sometimes I read r/news (to extent that it doesn't make me too angry) but apart from that, I stick to r/jokes, r/funny, r/aww etc. I come to reddit to feel good and learn a little. Not to hear opinions of bots/strangers.  Reddit is very good if you don't take it seriously. If you want to feel "engaged" on any special interest topics, reddit can be a hellhole. Special interest topics is where Reddit shines because it’s not flooded by the masses and most people who care enough about the topic have experience with it. It’s the more main stream stuff that goes to shit  I kinda like that it might be bots, or an organized effort by some group. If it wasn't that, I'd be pretty depressed about the state of this site and/or humanity. Like this heavily upvoted post here in this very sub about a bomb scare in Germany, with all those "Germany is fucked b/c refugees" bullshit: https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7gw4t8/german_police_find_christmas_market_bomb/  Here's the one from a few days later, when the police released what they found out: https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7halzu/potsdam_bomb_scare_likely_aimed_at_blackmailing/   Fucking ridiculous if you compare the amount of attention people spent on these stories. Well **I'm** not a bot. Good bot Bad bot.  I am a bot and so is my wife. That's exactly what a bot would say! Damn Synths... Everybody on reddit is a bot. !isbot Ghost4000 Me neither. But I don't know about these other blokes.  the fact that you have a 4000 in your username makes me suspicious. I assure you that I am **not** in any way the four thousandth attempt at creating a bot that passes as a human.  What's interesting about reddit too is the private subreddits which could be used to co-ordinate activity. Unless the admins monitor them these private groups could be used for a lot of dodgy stuff.  Most of these subs use outside apps like discord to coordinate rather than private subs.  Yea, like /r/a858de45f56d9bc9/  We *still* haven't figured out what the hell this is being used for. And I've been following it for 5 years. I saw a post once that explaned that you don't need to do much to sway the up/downvote on reddit . Just one or 2 up/down votes at the start have a major impact on the total of up/down  votes  a post or responce gets. I think you're thinking of this video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxNvUWN3vYk  Costs just $200 for a frontpage reddit post. Companies buy accounts with real posting histories so they can't easily be detected. Make your post at the right time, a handful of botnetted accounts upvote it almost immediately, reddit's sorting algorithm sees it's popular and pushes it to real people who continue to upvote. Kicks off a positive feedback loop and you hit the front page. The Independent was once a quality outlet that was bought by a Russian Oligarch and literally half or more of its traffic now probably comes from clickbait Reddit articles. I read 80% at one point but I can't for the life of me find it now.   oh you mean like the Independent anti Trump spam at r/worldnews There is no doubt there was a huge effort on Reddit as well.  Looking back to r/politics during the primaries and how many right wing sources were upvoted attacking Hillary...it was nuts.  The place was completely overwhelmed to the point I couldn't even go there anymore and had to find reasonable people in other subs to hang out in.  The admins and the mods let it happen.  It was obvious.  But maybe they didn't imagine it would go this badly.  But their continued lack of response to it is pretty disgusting.  It's almost enough that you want to do something like voat...except make it for decent people. &gt; Looking back to r/politics during the primaries and how many right wing sources were upvoted attacking Hillary...it was nuts.   r/politics has always been a mess, which was why it was removed the list of defaults way back in *2013*. It was Bernie Bernie Bernie during the primaries, then curiously switched over to Hillary Hillary Hillary way before he even dropped out. Today, practically every upvoted story has the word Trump in it.  Quite frankly, all default subs are a mess.  The higher the user count pretty much always indicates the place is going to be inundated with astroturfing and idiots. &gt;  Today, practically every upvoted story has the word Trump in it.  Well, yeah, he's the president. Like it or not, presidents tend to make political news, and Trump is abnormally loud and obnoxious, even for a president. /u/ParotidLahar probably meant that the upvoted articles are all *negative* to the president. From "sources" like BuzzFeed, ShareBlue, HuffPo... &gt;the upvoted articles are all negative to the president.   Given the reality of his time in office, what else would you expect?  &gt;From "sources" like BuzzFeed, ShareBlue, HuffPo...  Buzzfeed's news arm is decent enough. The other two, sure, I'd drop em. I'd also drop Breitbart and possibly FoxNews. &gt; I'd also drop Breitbart and possibly FoxNews.  Yea I don't think those two are an issue on r/politics.  What is ShareBlue? I asked about it in /r/politics and got downvoted. I suspected it was shills or bots downvoting me because I brought it up. No replies at all. https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/23/us/politics/hillary-clinton-media-david-brock.html hes historically unpopular. yeah most articles are going to be negative. Well, he is literally the worst President in my lifetime and will certainly go down as one of the worst in our history.  Just based on his constant lying alone.  Why would you think he deserves positive press? What in gods name are you taking about.  Politics was pro Bernie.  Then it went off the deep end for pro Hilary.   Nothing bad was ever posted about her.  The mods would ban anyone who even mentioned correct the record.  A few weeks ago I saw shareblue cited as a source.  The mods won't ban you for a conservative opinion but you'll be downvoted.  It's the only sub I have blocked presently.  I'm pretty sure I was banned from politics for saying "wow, you really corrected the record"    I was banned for ending a sentence with the word "comrade."  There was a very anti- Hillary sentiment for quite a while on politics.  Till she was the pick.  Then the sub did a complete 180. Within less than a day it seemed  It was quite impressive There was a big push by Russian bots to jump on the Dem split after the Primary.  They inflamed the Bernie supporters and attempted to drive a wedge between them and the Hilary camp.  They didn't *create* the wedge, but they definitely were out there trying to prevent a reconciliation.  Even after Bernie urged them to, the Russian bots were working to keep them from voting for her.   Interesting, and pretty plausible. I'd love to see if there is evidence of this. I applaud you for pointing out they didn't create the wedge, because c'mon - people are totally capable of doing these things on their own. Every time we blame something 100% on bots we're missing the point. I didn't save anything, but I looked up a lot of the Bernie supporters posting things to /r/Politics and many of them were active on /r/T_D.  It was pretty obvious back during that crazy time.   Uh, you are full of complete garbage.  During the primaries it was non-stop Breitbart articles that were bashing Hillary.  Even after the primaries, there was a ton of Hillary bashing going on though it got a tiny bit better.  r/politics has strict rules on calling people names.  I called out an obvious troll and was banned for it.  They had the same rule on saying someone was CTR (which was stupid and still is).  Still today Breitbart is allowed to be submitted despite it directly being far right propaganda.  Shareblue has sensationalized headlines...but I would be fine ditching it if they got rid of straight up propaganda. Breitbart is straight propaganda but shareblue isnt? In general I think overreading shilling into Reddit is probably a mistake. It almost certainly happens, but the setup of the site itself is basically really well made to make subreddits into circlejerks, in the absence of very strict moderation. PLUS, they didn't do anything to prevent the donald from taking over the front page with manipulation until AFTER the election. then they added some changes which fixed it... sorta... but also broke the site so news doesn't rise up as fast.  &gt; then they added some changes which fixed it.  Yeah, admins publicly setting high posts to zero really helped show us no censorship is happening...then the CEO of Reddit personally editing comments he didn't like....  Really fixing things. Rofl, still with the "zeroing our posts" meme. Do you also still think T_D has 5 million subscribers and Spez is causing it to display incorrectly on the sidebar?  Edit: Oh god that submission history. Please don't even answer my previous question.  interesting how my comment riled them up......  The admins did not set posts on the_donald to zero. Those posts made it to the front page and the general public downvoted the shit out of them. When a post has more downvotes than upvotes it sits at zero. The algorithm takes time to correct itself so they may linger even after getting slammed with downvotes. The reality is that most of the content from t_d that reaches the general reddit audience isn’t popular and IMO, wrong and annoying. It’s not a conspiracy.  There won't be because it's content they like Start with /r/politics and work out from there. But how many of those followers were real people and how many were bots? The bots are inflating the number of users on twitter; I don't think twitter wants to know how many are out there. Oh Twitter knows. They just don’t want their investors to know.  Or advertisers.  Will we get to a point where bots are advertising to only bots? I'm sure we're already there. Now, if I could get a bot that collects incorrect info for other bots, THAT would be sweet.  Http://adnauseam.io  Of course there is. Banned from Chrome though... Honestly, why do I use this piece of shit browser lol Any alternative suggestions?  You can still install it on Chrome.  Just have to enable developer mode. Click the chrome icon on the site and you can get it going in seconds. It also works for Firefox and Opera.  This tricks ads and Shit giving them useless data, which is fun.  If you want to kill ads on your entire network setup pi-hole.net on a machine and point your routers DNS to that box.   You can go super crazy and run openVPN on the same box and use it for you mobile as well when not on your home network.  So much this. Twitter is a dead platform for advertisers who aren't HUGE brands, but they want you to believe that because those huge brands do it, you can as well. Twitter is good at spreading information like wildfire, but if you don't have something people care about, you're just chucking money out the window.  Nah, I've botted before. Its cat and mouse. The noob botters are always detected, the pros are always a step or two ahead of the game.    Why would the investors care? They invested in a company that makes no money and has no plans to change that. And is twitter going to notify those accounts that they were following propaganda from a hostile state under the guise of news? I think that’s the most important step after disabling the fake accounts.  The users probably don't care.  They'll just rush to the next account to follow that validates their feelings. As long as journalists consider Twitter fights news, it doesn't matter. Bot A tweets something offensive. Bots B, C, and D tweet back. Journalist reports on Twitter fight and uses tweets in the story. Story circulates. At no point does it matter if A, B, C, and D were real people.  It really is amazing how many fake twitter accounts there are. There are thousands and thousands of “stan” accounts for people like Bieber, Selena Gomez, 1direction that are obviously fake when you click on the account.  Excellent point! Yes, there are! EDIT: I mean, my own screen name is simply two hockey teams that I like along with my first name, but there are some accounts that smell of fake big time. Facebook is completely infested with russian trolls, if I had to estimate, there are double what there were in january. I wouldn't worry about it, very few actual users on twitter anyways. Like 5 years ago I read that 90% of twitter content was made and consumed by 10% of twitter users. Does't seem that serious. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)  Here you go No word on Twitter's artificial manipulation of what is or isn't "trending". I think the following is the most important part of the article and is something everyone will need to be more vigilant about in order to protect democracy.  &gt; Researchers say another purpose of the accounts was to establish them as trusted news sources, and then activate them later to spread propaganda and disinformation. Troll factories have taken that approach before. During the escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine in 2014, Nimmo observed various online forums and platforms linked to Russian troll factories that would ingratiate themselves in the pro-Ukrainian community by posting favorable information. Then after gaining credibility, those sites would shift their tone to write stories that expressed discontent with Ukraine. &gt; &gt; In fact, Nimmo says these news imposter accounts may have been created for an operation that never happened. A U.S. intelligence report concluded that the Russian government was expecting Hillary Clinton to win the election and were prepared to call into question the validity of the results. Pro-Kremlin bloggers had prepared a Twitter campaign, #DemocracyRIP on election night in anticipation of her victory, according to the report. These news imposter accounts could have aided those efforts to undermine the election results by promoting certain hashtags and topics like “voter fraud” or “rigged election."  By having a network of local news accounts across the country, the Kremlin would be able to distribute propaganda at scale that could galvanize local populations to protest, according to Nimmo. A Russian-linked Facebook group attempted to organize anti-immigrant and anti-Hillary Clinton protests in Texas shortly before the November elections. &gt; &gt; The majority of the imposter news accounts were created more than a year before the 2016 U.S. elections. The history of tweets and engagement with real users improves the placement of the account and its posts in Twitter's search results, according to Kris Shaffer, a data scientist doing research for University of Mary Washington and the Data for Democracy. That means that if the account does push major disinformation campaigns, it is less likely to be blocked. &gt; &gt; Shaffer's analysis of the accounts found that several of the imposter news accounts also tweeted during the French presidential election. He surfaced about 41 Tweets from accounts including @WorldNewsPoli, @TodayMiami, @DetroitDailyNew, and @ChicagoDailyNew. Most of the posts were retweets of local news articles, but more than a quarter of them included stories from truthfeed.com, a known disinformation site, according to Shaffer. Those stories were mostly attacking Emmanuel Macron, who won the election, and biased toward Marine Le Pen, a far-right politician in France. This highlights the long game that Putin is playing.   The problem, as I see it, is without the cooperation of FB, Twitter, reddit, etc., there really isn't anyway to proactively (or at lease concurrently) stop the propaganda.  This is truly mind boggling. They are playing a very long game here and they have basically rigged the levers of profit seeking companies to make sure it's in those companies interest to allow them to persist. The last thing Facebook and Twitter want to do is reduce their page views or user counts.  Of course, like 50% of Twitter is bots. Bots following bots. Inception!  Artifical ignorance.  And yet the biggest remains, making HYUUGE, baseless and inane comments?  Their hearts ain't in it. This is why social media is garbage. It perpetuates false news and high school drama. Ultimately it lies on the individuals that blindly share without cross referencing and fact checking. Something is finally being done about this. Stop being so spineless, Zuck I wonder how many of that 500k actually believe these were Kremlin backed news sources now that this has occurred, and how many have their tin foil hats on claiming deep state took down the real news sources. Not very good with the internetz, but when I checked out a couple of the Twitter accounts mentioned in the article all it looked like was news postings with not even a dozen likes (unless likes don't show up like [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20160620041108/https://twitter.com/TodayNYCity/status/744588336749109248)) At this point i dont even think that GOP will care. Their voters are brainwashed beyond redemption. If theres one thing that Trump was spot on was his statement "i could shoot somebody and not lose any voters" It's not just a Republican thing, as much as you would want it to be.  Take a look at hashtags like #Resist and you'll find dozens of bots spamming messages as well. Yup. The goal is to further the divide. Purposely triggering articles up voted/liked/followed by armies of bots to fake support. Turned the information super highway into a troll parade.  I don't think the goal is *always* to divide, but even when it isn't, its a common outcome. &gt;There were both left-leaning and right-leaning accounts.  Did you not read the article? What the fuck are you talking about? This isn't /r/politics, mate. I mean, multiple studies have shown a causal link between low intelligence and prejudice (in the forms of racism, sexism, religious fanatism etc). Prejudice is everything Trump represents so GOP voters being immune to reason shouldnt surprise anyone. Source on that? I'm interested if you have a link. [Is Racism Just a Form of Stupidity? The short answer is yes](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/were-only-human/is-racism-just-a-form-of-stupidity.html) Uh, your source is literally an op-ed and doesn't contain any sources of its own and is the author "summing up" studies using unprofessional language no credible scientist would use.  &gt;One such study looked at general intelligence in 10- and 11-year-old kids, and then re-studied those kids as adults two decades later—and found a clear connection between low intelligence and subsequent racism and sexism. Similarly, higher intelligence in childhood has been shown to predict less racism in adulthood. These analyses strongly suggest that low intelligence actually leads to hateful attitudes later on.  "One study"? This is supposedly a highly educated researcher. What study? Do you even have a name for it so we can look it up?  It honestly reads like a long-form Reddit comment you'd find at the top of a  thread in /r/politics.  **EDIT:** I looked up Dhont and Hodson whose research he keeps mentioning and uh... yeah I don't think these two scientists can be taken particularly seriously. [Here's a study they did about political ideology and eating meat.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666316308923) It's completely full of subjective opinions and ridiculous statements that belie an intense bias.   Here's how they described reasons why left-wing people eat meat: "personal inconvenience", "meat cravings", "awkwardness in social settings", and "health/nutrition concerns".  Here's how they described reasons why right-wing people eat meat: "Hedonistic", "human supremacy", "entitlement",  and "animal exploitation".  These two are a couple of twats. In America or other similar multicultural societies sure.  I think the link is that lower intelligence means that you have more trouble with the unknown and ambiguous data, and things that don't have a very simple explanation.  Racism has a trifecta for people like that.  No ambiguity (blacks lose because dumb and violent), nothing unknown (you can know that guy whether or not you bother to talk to him), and the explanation is simple (bio truths).   Replace "GOP" with "Democratic Party" and Trump with "Hillary" and it would be equally true. Just saying. "They suspended the accounts because they have a political agenda and don't want us to know the *truth!*" You realize the Kremlin was producing pro-Trump, Anti-Trump, pro-Bernie, pro-Hillary, etc fake news? Their goal was to produce chaos all around.  I don't remember any of it being Pro-Hillary. It was def pro-Bernie, Pro-Trump and maybe pro-Jill Stein Their top goal was getting the Magnitsky Act repealed, second was sowing chaos.  The best chance to get the Magnitsky Act repealed was via Trump so they most definitely were trying to get Trump elected.   lol fuck off liar. name one single headline that was russian propaganda that was pro Hillary. He sexually assaulted many people and still won the presidency, so yeah. Weird how T_D are angry about this here... It would be hilarious if this comment was made by a bot. They are? this claim doesn't seem to check out We are? It says that "there were both left-leaning and right-leaning accounts". IMO this is really no different than the MSM (on both sides) jumping to false conclusions and manipulating the truth on a daily basis. They got played. Being played causes shame and embarrasment, and that in turn forces a decision: reject what you thought was true and thus undermine who you thought you were, or double-down and attack those trying to pop your bubble. &gt; They got played.  They willingly sought to be played. No kidding. They swallowed Putin's cock right down to his balls. I really don't see how they "got played" when Trump is in the white house. Because it wasn't their success, it was Russia's and they got used.  I doubt that. Plus the article mentions both sides got played.  &gt; @BlackNewsOutlet, one of the fake accounts, had more than 40,000 followers and had a description of "Freedom is never given; it is won. #BlackLivesMatter." Tweets from this account frequently posted news about social unrest or headlines to incite anger. A retweeted post from @BlackNewsOutlet on Oct. 19, 2016 read: "How many more black lives needed to change the rotten police systems?" Of course, the Russians want a divided America. But if you read about their behavior on Facebook, it was quite amazing. They would make bro-Black Lives Matters or Pro-Jewish advertisements, and then they would make sure that only conservatives saw it. It riled up the base.  They made a lot of Stein and Sanders stuff too, and flooded it on liberal members.  It's harder to target that on Twitter, so they just make items that are decisive and create chaos. But both sides had their own agenda. As an analogy, consider back when [America armed Afghanistan's mujahideen in the 1980s.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cyclone) Were the Afghans "played" and "used" when they drove out the USSR? Or had they successfully exploited international politics to fulfil their own goals? You could spin it either way. Trump turned out to be pretty much the opposite of what they thought he was I guess, but it's still better than Hillary for them so it doesn't matter. The choice was binary.  The Supreme Court nomination, Muslim ban etc are all things that they wanted. [removed] Well, for a lot of them, it was their accounts. Please fellow American computer twiter comrades to be follow me at new account @nkvd1! Much not fake news to be given daily! Followed! Please tell me how special I am and how everyone that isn't my race or doesn't have the same beliefs as me is trying to kill me and how we can have a wall build between us and them! kthxbai Twitter needs a report possible bot option. I report as many bots as I can, but it’s difficult to block them all, bc most follow the guidelines... no harassment, not a hacked account, etc.   You know when an account is posting and retweeting hundreds of tweets an hour for days, something is not right.  Whew! Just in time! Thank god Twitter did this before any damage was done. “Dozens”.   Twitter: least amount of effort applied.  I take it this was after they begged RT to buy advertising space during the election?  Twitter is a joke.  Kind of wish they would suspend the accounts of television personalities masqueradimg as news journalists. What I'd like to know is, how did they determine they're "Kremlin backed"? Simply because they were using Russian ips? Anyone from the world can acquire Russian servers and do this on them. I have gotten accounts banned for being a "russian troll". There are just sensitive topics in America that you can't talk about and if you do your comments or accounts get deleted for "Russian trolling". i am Canadian but that doesn't seem to matter.  I've been opposed to most wars the US has fought in my lifetime, but God damm we should level that Russian troll factory.  IMHO, people who work there are no less combatants than men with rifles, and much more dangerous to our democracy. Why do the Russians not hide their ips? That is a good question. I assume they knew only Twitter could see their IP's, but assumed they'd never bother looking. I wonder how many innocent VPN/Tor users were snared in the crossfire....as I always Reddit through Tor. Today, I am an Austrian :) You want bots?  Reddit's got all the bots you need.  I’m wondering how they figure they were kremlins backed accounts? Rather than normal conservative papers tweeted accounts.  Veles, Yugoslavia. Facebook and Twitter have tracked these accounts origin back to this city and others like it. IP addresses. Even if they're masked or something, I'm sure you can find patterns. The ip address doesn't mean anything. Have you ever heard of a VPN. I could easily change mine to show a Russian IP address source the the Internet Research agency is an arm of the Kremlin?  Just because IP addresses were traced to Russia/IRA does not necessarily indicate that it was backed by the Kremlin If that is true, they don't understand proxies. I'm not debating there *aren't* bot farms but they could easily use something like Tor. They could all appear out the same exit node. The article states that the accounts targeted both political spectrums to move each side further into extremism.  So I wouldn't get excited calling only Trump followers idiots.  And before those who say this is a false narrative, as the numbers might not be equal, that doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things.  This can be looked at alternatively as the opposing side doesn't need as much pushing to go off the deep end.  The bottom line is that both the left and the right were played, and that should be scary to any rational person. source the the Internet Research Agency is an arm of the Kremlin?  Why can't any article demonstrate the connection? &gt; "We take seriously reports that the power of our service was misused by a foreign actor for the purpose of influencing the U.S. presidential election and undermining public faith in the democratic process,"   Does that include Trump? Well considering the fact that Twitter offered RT a preferential advertising deal, it's more than a little hypocritical of them to come out now pretending like they're fucking white knights of technology here to save America.  &gt; "We take seriously reports that the power of our service was misused by a foreign actor  Bloody Shatner again. Isn’t that exactly what Twitter wants? Large social influence utilizing their platform?  Not yet, but they see the writing on the wall regarding his impeachment. We will soon have a whack job Evangelical as president. Jesus tittyfucking Christ... You mean the guy sitting next to everyone else in the meetings? If you want to fix the fake news cycle, take it one step past notifying user who saw fake news. Notify the users as to who reposted the article(s), if your friends and followers knew you were reposting garbage you might think twice before reposting a click bait article.  About a year late, idiots.   They knew what they were doing. Hmph, only the tip of the iceberg How many terrorist accounts have been suspended?  it would be nice if the subscribers got notified that the account that they subscribed was kicked for this. it might help close the loop so they are less susceptible to the next bot. Would be nice if could suspend some of the celebrity accounts with 500k followers that act like they are news to push their agendas too. Just in the nick of time! I wonder is trump’s account was one of those? Proof that the IRA (internet research agency) is ran by the Kremlin?  They say "kremlin backed" and in the headline "kremlin tried" but I see nothing of significance to suggest that the IRA is an arm of the Kremlin.   Just out of curiosity Id like to know the forensic digital evidence linking these bots to the Kremlin. I see a lot of claims of Russian connections to a lot of things and very little evidence being provided to the public at large substantiating claims like this Bandaid solution. Fix your society so they don't believe this BS. Education.  Too late for that, whats left of it is being demolished by the GOP and Betsy DeVos. Doesn't matter. Twitter still hasn't banned the Kremlin's star player for violating their TOS. I'm pretty sure he'll be impeached before that happens.  Right? And yet they'll suspend Uma Thurman for acknowledging that Harvey Weinstein is scum. A bunch of Kemliin-backed Twitter accounts get banned. No surprise, a bunch on t_d accounts come on here to pretend it's no big deal.  &gt;There were both left-leaning and right-leaning accounts.  Maybe try reading the article? So many things about the Russian social media stuff confuses me. Like:  &gt; Information on the details of the accounts was gathered from Meltwater, a data intelligence firm that monitors social media.   Who is Meltwater and why are they being used as opposed to Twitter itself? Or the Defense Dept?  I read their Wikipedia page and there's nothing to make me believe that they are anything more than a newsclipping service. They bought some AI companies but that doesn't mean that there methods are accurate.  If they have hard evidence I'd love to see it. It would be fascinating to see how they connect accounts to the Russians.  &gt; Researchers have concluded that many of the IRA-linked accounts were created to sow social discord, by trying to "put left-wing people further to the left and right-wing people further to the right," said Ben Nimmo, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council Digital Forensic Research Lab. "It's that attempt to amplify the differences in society."  This just seems too vague to be true. I could understand Russian intelligence trying to make people pro-Russia or against certain foreign policy issues, but general discord? Sounds like something from the Red Scare of the 50s.  I'm not saying that Russia isn't doing this. Something's clearly up. It's just the facts of these cases are a mess. Keep on fighting windmills, meanwhile the rich get richer. [deleted] Is it even a narrative at this point? I feel like it's been pretty well established that the Russian government has a strong internet presence dedicated towards pushing certain ideas. I’ve always wondered how many reddit accounts are just Russian Trolls  the ones pedaling CTR during the election, no doubt.
 Man... Sarah Jessica Parker really went off the deep end.  he sounds unstable to me I don't think so. he was holding a stable relationship.  Nothing wrong with a little horseplay When the horse was asked if they consented they said neigh... Must have been JRHNBR. How does a horsefucker know how to treat a girlfriend? &gt; he had the mare’s tail in his hand and was pressing hard against the mare’s rear end  That's it?  I'm not convinced.  There's probably a very simple, innocent explanation This is what the Democratic Party promotes, awful Hillary goes by Ruby now? who are we to judge their love? the horse was saying hay, not heeeeeey~ How? I don't know a lot about horses but couldn't a horse that doesn't want you behind it simply kick your testicles through your butthole? It wasn't even his horse!
 I remember when they blew up Lord Mountbatten Why keep fighting? They got the good Friday agreement, Catholics are outbreeding protestants and all sides are committed to accept the outcome of the vote when it happens, and Ireland is going to accept them back in a landslide if the North wants it.  Why risk losing all that? Because some people hold a grudge The Troubles is an interesting conflict I wish was taught more often in the US. 
 Hope those people get out of there safely.  Also, best wishes to Live Updates on finding a new job. Prayers for those who are in the area of this threat. thots and prayers Wishes and hope.  Do you guys want some water ?
 Are there any window surfaces that could protect pilots? Solid aluminum would do the trick. Yes, [transparent aluminum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVgRj2e5_s) He said solid! Can it be a one way mirror? It probably doesn't have the required characteristics for a windscreen? [removed] spoken by someone who has no idea how to pilot a plane... I mean that would be why he formed his comment into a question.  Pilots do almost all the flying still, despite what people imagine as "auto pilot"  Landing and takeoff requires skill and those guys and gals have it.  Keeping a plane in the sky is not necessarily as difficult but there are thousands of decisions to make that require human input at this point in time.  It might happen in the future but its a very manual process still and I'm okay with that It's a mix. We don't pay mainline pilots six figures a year to fly the plane every day, as any mediocre pilot could do that. A lot of the pilots use automation a large part of the time, including landing.  We pay them six figures a year to be there to keep the plane from crashing when shit goes wrong, like with Sully. but is it automation like we would interpret it for vehicles per se?  I know altitude and pitch/roll/yaw are probably controlled by gps/imu but I assume at least one pilots job is to ensure things aren't going awry.  I should learn more about it, the waypoint system is something I've used in my own work, the concept, not the automated aspects.   Other than the take-off, a pilot could fly many of the newer planes, including landing at many airports, by doing nothing but inputting way-points and altitudes into the autopilot. There's enough automation that many people fear that some pilots are getting a bit rusty by not getting enough hands on time.  At the same time, the air traffic control system needs a full upgrade before we're ready for more automated flying.  Another thing to think about is human intuition, or a pilot's gut feeling about what to do in an emergency. On the one hand, Sully did what a computer wouldn't do, saving the plane. At the same time, many plane crashes happened because the pilots disregarded the computer and/or instruments. interesting points, thanks for the insight! Would you fly in one of them? Yes, actually. For single-engine planes and they haven't been approved by the FAA yet.
 This is federal, so he's actually going to be spending the rest of his life in prison. He's not going to be getting paroled after 10 years. Hes awaiting sentencing in MI for CSC charges. The **MINIMUM** sentence will be between 25 and 60 years, maximum is life. He's never getting out of prison. If/when he's released from the feds, he'll be bussed or flown to MI to serve the rest of his sentence.  Edit: Formatting  Probably won't last 10 years anyways. Prison is a tough place for people in for crimes against Children. I thought they kept people like this segregated so they don't get passed around like a sexual football. It's federal prison, he will be protected. Good, may he rot in there for life  Nassar is also awaiting sentencing in two Michigan counties (Ingham and Eaton) for some CSC charges. The **MINIMUM** sentence will be between 25 and 60 years, maximum is life. He's never getting out of prison. If/when he's released from the feds, he'll be bussed or flown to MI to serve the rest of his sentence.  
 Not just an officer, but a captain; and this is her third incident of making inappropriate comments to colleagues.   A second cop - who was the target of her latest comment— was also suspended 2 days for stating he was offended by her remarks. I think that one is bs. He asked her to expand on some statistics and she told him he wouldn’t understand because of his ‘white male privilege’, so he left the room.   This stuff is getting ridiculous. No one has the right to dismiss someone else’s life experiences and suggest they haven’t struggled or faced adversity because of their gender or color of their skin. A supervisor certainly shouldn’t be saying it to colleagues. I remember when making assumptions about a person based on their race was called 'racism'. 2017, what a time to be alive. [deleted] I know this is going to be contentious, but I think it's fair to question what doesn't align with your experience. I remember in college, I had to take a sexual harassment training which stated that 1 in 4 women have been raped. That number seems insanely high to me and does not match what I've seen. But because the statistic doesn't include my demographic, I'm not allowed to be sceptical or question where this information came from? &gt; That number seems insanely high to me and does not match what I've seen.  That's because that statistic counts sexual encounters that a woman regrets the next day as rape along with cat-calling. Yeah if it was actually 1 in 4, who would send there child into that kind if environment? &gt; who would send there child into that kind if environment?  No one would. [deleted] &gt;Now, am I correct? Probably not. I can guess, but statistically, I’m probably wrong. Yet, that’s what this cop was doing.  That's what both cops were doing then. The woman was saying he had "white male privilege", but she's not a white male, so by your logic, she has no grounds to speculate on the experience of someone who is.  My point is that statistics don't always tell the full story. They're rarely generated by people with no agenda. For example, the 1 in 4 statistic I mentioned in my last comment was from a sample of women who volunteered to take a survey about rape and some answers were manipulated through interpretation. There's an inherent bias because the groups collecting this data are the ones benefiting from an inflated number. Now in this case, the article didn't mention the specifics, so I can't say anything about that. But I can say that if a stat doesn't match you (admittedly anecdotal) perception of reality, it's your right to be sceptical. In fact, it's encouraged in science. Even if the claim completely agrees with your experiences, it's still perfectly valid to be skeptical. An individual's experiences are hardly the bar for proof of a claim, and even things which seem intuitively correct can be wrong. [deleted] &gt;So she isn’t allowed to tell him he’s wrong for using stories to refute stats?  She definitely is, but it's hypocritical to say that he's wrong because he isn't in the demographic being talked about and then say the reason for his mistake is him being from a demographic of which she isn't a part.  Also,  &gt; [He] sought clarity on some statistics cited by trainers because they didn't reflect what he has experienced during his career in law enforcement.  He wasn't refuting them, according this article (which probably has some bias of its own).  We measure problems in society by examining both sides of an argument and doing our best to objectively remove bias, or at least recognize that it exists. You can't blindly accept a claim just because there's some cherrypicked stat to back it up. The stat probably has some value, but it's society's job to be sceptical and find out the full story.  [deleted] &gt;So you think I can speak intelligently about what it’s like to be a black woman?  Are you generalizing the experiences of all individual black women into a single representation of "what It's like?"  You don't know exactly what it's like to be a particular black woman any more than one black woman knows what its like to be another black woman. Everyone has different life experiences, but that doesn't mean we can't speak intellectually about them. I'm sure you have black women in your life and your experiences have enough in common that you can have an intelligent discussion. You wouldn't know every detail, but you could at least make an educated guess. &gt; Are you generalizing the experiences of all individual black women into a single representation of "what It's like?"  Of course he is.  That’s how all this social justice stuff works.  It’s just collectivism via skin color.   No he asked for a source of the stats because it didn't match his experience, that is not dismissing the statistic. Asking for clarification is not the same as declaring the statistic wrong. And instead of providing the source of the statistic he was told his white privilege made his question irrelevant.  [deleted] yes, he asked for a source and stated why he wanted a source. But instead of discussing it like an adult, he was told his white privilege was why, which only refuted his personal anecdotes but doesn't answer the question of where the statistic came from. I'd say pointing out his race and gender refuted nothing. [deleted] [removed] Saying "I've never encountered this or heard of this before, what is your source?" Is acceptable for any and all claims. You make a claim the burden is on you to back it up, not the burden is on me to refute or accept your claim.  Here is an example. Vaccines cause autism. I have never heard or experienced that, do you have any sources? Your kids never had autism so you wouldn't understand.  That is not an acceptable line of reasoning. I don't understand and don't believe you so I want more than just your words. If you cannot proved that then I reject your claim. For the people who don't enjoy reading: officer is a middle aged white woman Trying to put my finger on it... Jeff Daniels? Weird to see a controversy with the police on this end of the spectrum for once. \&gt; waits patiently for the reddit Free Speech Brigade^TM to come and defend this woman Government as employer is actually an interesting 1st Amendment question that has spawned some specific case law. In this case, because the speech was related to her official duties, it does not receive much in the way of protection. Cf. Garcetti v. Ceballos  &gt;We hold that when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.  Even if this wasn't part of her duties, it would still likely be unprotected speech given that the statement was not made as a private citizen on a matter of public concern.  I didn't read this article because the website is so awful. Keep nerfing the world. Even cops are soft now. She is clearly a moron. Move on. Even worse on the chief if he couldn't already look at the character of this loser on his force previous to any complaints.  She's right. But that's not the place to say it.   She sounds racist and sexist, assuming things about a person based on their race and sex. Male white privilege is not something you assume, it's just something that is present in our society.  She shouldn't have said it but she's right, unless you're a minority gender like trans then you can never truly understand what it's like to be trans. I'm male and white and do my best to be as inclusive as possible to everyone but I don't deny my privilege. I want to know what she said at the firing range. I like her. Not that she's right, or that she has the right, but that the Plainfield police dept has had nothing to get this excited about since that irresponsible Ben Affleck closed the ZZZ Accounting Agency overnight, leaving all those clients in the lurch. Every department needs someone like Captain Weber. Not even the right Plainfield you moron. 
 Good- fuck them.    Of course this will be shit for customers as SCE will surely use it as another excuse to raise rates.  Hope they’re bought out by Tesla in a cruel twist of fate. There’s no money in the long term for power companies anymore.   Edit: I got downvotes with no comments?  Maybe I should explain.   The business model power companies use is based on producing/selling electricity and delivering that power through the grid. However, in the past couple decades, the demand for power has declined as many companies and homeowners are now capable of generating their own power through solar. Solar has only become cheaper and more accessible, and it is likely this trend will continue.   That means the main revenue stream for these companies is disappearing. I know we still need fossil and hydro at this point because solar is not entirely reliable enough yet, and we don’t have practical or affordable ways to store power when the sun is not generating... yet.   So power companies, to maintain the grid, have to keep generation facilities operational, even though they aren’t generating/selling as much power as before, but at a similar expense in order to maintain the grid. The costs associated with maintaining power lines and substations is fairly consistent, hopefully newer more reliable transformers will lead to less future maintenance, but at this point, there are still a lot of costs involved to keep the grid. You can already see the effects of this, PGE is cutting annual operations budget by millions, laying of many employees and contractors. Yet, your bill still went up even though they spent less this year.    Now look 20 - 30 years in the future. Home battery back ups may become standard hardware. Solar roofs may become building code, pretty soon a modern home can generate its own electricity and store it long enough for the sun to come out. And just in case, they might have a high efficiency generator as a back up. The demand for power and to be connected to grid would likely also decline.   So my point is, why would Tesla get involved in a failing industry? They don’t want to maintain an old grid, they are the ones reimagining the role of the power company altogether.   If you’re young and looking for a career, power generation is not a good long term option, unless it’s for renewables and alternative energy sources.  Even Elon Musk says they're not here to replace up electric companies. Maybe if they’re lucky they’ll also get blamed and sued for the fires like PG&amp;E has in Northern California.  It's hard to believe those fires were started by PG&amp;E power lines being knocked down.  I sail in the bay and the winds out here are always strong.  They tried to [claim the winds were near 70 mph that night, but were 30-40mph](http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/10/12/california-fires-pge-power-lines-fell-in-winds-that-werent-hurricane-strength/), which isn't that out of the ordinary.  Idk, maybe they were, but that many fires all starting in various location in such a short time span, with those kind of winds seemed odd to me. I thought is was because of poor tree maintenance, a limb or tree fell on the line causing a large swath of the lines to hit the ground and spark over a long distance. The lack on maintenance is where they are being blamed.  There were a [bunch of different fires all over the north bay](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/national/northern-california-fires/img/napa-fires-2300.jpg) that stared with in an hour or so, it just seems like this would be alot more common, it's not unusual for them to see winds around those speeds.    Edit: changed link to a better map, I don't think the 1st one was working.  On mobile so I can find a better one tomorrow if you're interestes. Yes this map is much better. Thank you.   The clustering does make it look even more like they may have had a single cause for each cluster, but there are distinctly different clusters which does seems odd if it were just wind related. I would expect 1 or 2 areas tightly grouped but this is more tightly on some and varied in others. Hopefully we do get definitive answers before next season. Prevention is the only real treatment option we have.  I lived on a somewhat remote property 3 years ago. PG&amp;E was on that property at least every 3 months for "maintenance". After the 3 or 4th time I straight told the worker that he is full of shit. He asked me what I mean? I told him that it's clear they think I'm stealing power and they are coming to check the lines, so fuck you.    I find it interesting that they would send people an hour or more out to that spot just to spend an hour doing nothing when they have maintenance issues in other places. Fuck PG&amp;E. Wasn't the claim that it was the sparking that started the fires? It doesn't take much wind to make wires sway and strike each other. Idk, I haven't really followed it since, but it would seem like it would be alot more common if 30mph winds caused that.   Ordinarily, wires are covered in insulation or are regularly repaired to prevent them from sagging and causing this exact thing. I wouldn't expect the author company of "burn, baby, burn" to care much about it, though. &gt;It's hard to believe those fires were started by PG&amp;E power lines being knocked down.  Why?  They have a poor record in terms of maintaining their power lines. Even if they did get blown down, I imagine they'll have to prove negligence. Edison has a far better track record than PG&amp;E does. That's what the stock drop is about. although corporations are people, my friend, they'll never get the death penalty. like the lowliest of us real people. So KTLA just couldn't resist putting 'Spark' in the title.    Well done. Perfect safety or affordable electricity.  Choose one. Or in the case of SCE, neither.  They are a shitty company. My brother is a currently a 3rd party welding inspector for their gas lines. They were doing the wrong weld on some pipe and my brother pointed it out to a SoCal gas supervisor and told him that he couldn't sign-off on the welds. The supervisor told him that if he wouldn't sign-off on the welds, they would find someone who will. My brother didn't want to lose his $75/hr job, so he capitulated.    I told him that he is a greedy fucking Republican with no morals ethics or values and he should have gone to the press, and still should. He doesn't care, he wants the money. Hey guys, look at this moron! He plays identity politics, point at him and laugh. Utility companies should not be allowed to be for-profit. ISPs should be utility companies. Probably would be wise to spend a few million to actually do something about it, rather than sustain losses of 3 billion.
 If it's so smart, why does it think I want to buy stuff I just bought??? Mankind is constantly warned of this great danger but continue to pursue it. Were all going to be destroyed by the complacent curiosity of scientists. The biggest threat to national security. Ever have time and want a good read I'd suggest reading the Dune series. It's funny to me because they've outlawed "thinking machines" due to them nearly wiping out mankind. But to deny such research would be a burdensome denial of freedom. The research is also easy enough to perform that it would be difficult to regulate. It will be interesting to see where the world goes as power becomes even cheaper and easier to wield. I do not look forward to the destruction of mankind. That's not really how computer science works.  It does, eventually these computers will get sick of us and riot. Actually... As someone who studies computer science: no. You're just spouting off feel good fiction that has no basis in reality. We are a long ways from having computers that can FEEL anger or desire vengeance and even further from the computers having the capabilities to bypass their constraints.  Computer science isn't this fairy tail where you tell a computer to do one thing and it does another. It's just not how programming or AI works.  Thank you. Finally a bit of rational sense explained.   &gt;Computer science isn't this fairy tail where you tell a computer to do one thing and it does another.  For someone who "studies computer science" you don't seem to have a very good grasp of what these machines are doing.  They're being given goals, and a mechanism to learn to achieve them, not being instructed directly how to get from point A to point B.  When you turn machine learning on, you're not "telling" computer how to achieve it's task.  If you knew what the best way was, you wouldn't be building a learning computer to help you figure it out.  And the fact computers don't "feel" anything is probably their most dangerous trait.  They're not going to share our value systems in anyway, so there's no expectation that they're going to act human.   &gt; For someone who "studies computer science" you don't seem to have a very good grasp  I actually have a reasonable grasp of the methodologies. I don't care to learn **ALL** the maths involved but when you get down to it the statistics involved become rather mundane. The weights the biases the adjustments thereof... even the calculus that gets thrown in to optimize process is rather mundane when you break it down to its components.  I'm certainly not qualified to lecture on the topic but there are plenty of resources around if you are interested:  https://codeahoy.com/2017/07/28/ai-is-not-magic-how-neural-networks-learn/  A robot might be able to pick your face out of a crowd but it is very far from usurping control of its parameters and acting in an exotic way as to harm specified humans. Silence him! He’s discovered our plan to serve the computer overlords! Same. I wish we would embark on our major projects now, such as getting people to mars, before any windows close. Maybe Transhumanism can save us. The AIs rise and we go along with them since they've been fundementally woven into our very being. Any advancement in robotics also being an advancement in our own bionic design.  Forget Skynet.  We need to worry about the all knowing Google AI from waking up. They have already created AIs capable of teaching itself and another able to write AI code better than people can. All they need is for an AI to teach itself to code better than a human and we've officially hit Singularity.  We won't though. The AI will be locked into the parameters and morality of that one single code. AI is not going to be given free reins on this, that's what the marketers of Watson and so forth will continue to espouse, so as to sell the blooming software and hardware. We've a long way to go yet, and AI will be kept firmly on a leash. I understand how easy it is to believe this, and I believe it not sinking ago until I embarked on a Computer Science course to which there are multiples of codes out there. Even web design now there's not a single language for coding because you can encapsulate everything within the parameters of another code. Don't code my site with HTML or PHP or Javascript or do I go the whole hot and design a whole online programme. We're far from the singularity, very far from it.  It's fucking Chess. okay now solve P vs NP problems mr. superhuman computer AI
 So Hamas violated the reconciliation deal, then?  I thought that Hamas agreed to cease all attacks against Israel after signing the reconciliation agreement with the Palestinian Authority.   Does that deal only start at a certain date or is it currently in effect? Not after yesterday and the Palestinians calling for days of anger. They are seriously upset the embassy was moved. And they are apparently willing to throw more away for nothing  I don't believe the Embassy is moving yet. If I recall the last article I read, Trump signed a waiver which pushes off the move for another nine months.   During that time, they will scout locations, figure out a security plan, and begin building the new Embassy.  Ok, obviously it wasn't moved overnight, it's not like we were fleeing the country... but the issue still stands regardless if it happens now or in four years from now. Isreal and Jerusalem were recognized and that pissed of the Palestinians even though this isn't REALLY anything new   That’s why I don’t care when the IDF curb stomps them. That's just a savage mindset.   I support Israel but I don't ignore inhumanity when it happens.  They shouldn’t have voted for hamas if they don’t like it... And then Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital. What do you think is going to happen in the area, everlasting peace? It's going to escalate again.  &gt;recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital   Wasn't that done in 1995?  And ordered the U.S. embassy to move there, to boot.  One thing has nothing to do with the other.  Hamas signed the reconciliation deal to reconcile with the Palestinian Authority. The document doesn't stated that it's voided if Jerusalem is declared Israeli. That's attaching conditions that don't exist. Their agreement is with the palestinian authorities who as of yesterday declared that friday will be the first day of a new intifada.    Hamas probably figures no-one cares to stop them anymore. Unsurprisingly, people get upset and lob Katyushas at you when the United States unilaterally hands ownership of land that a lot of people have historical claim to to a state that hasn't existed for 70 years.   I'm also totaly sure that this will end with Israel recognizing that other people might have a claim to the most sanctified land in the world and with people who think the Arab world might have half a point not being called anti-Semites. "Some moronic fuckwit from a different continent made a stupid decision that has no practical effect on jack shit. We better fire unguided rockets at a population center in response!"  - other moronic fuckwits, probably  HA! Such a bunch of jerkoffs....oh well....back to smackin them around I guess. Carve them a new asshole! This very very very sad Just as Trump wanted. A start of another war in the Middle East. You can always count on the little to non existant self control of these people. I imagine he has companies or shares in companies that will supply bedding, magazines, MREs, face scarves, bullets, etc..  no one could be this stupid as to make the declaration Trump did without being positioned to make money.  I’m sure they appreciate the coordinates. “Aim farther next time” 
 Pretty sure it was stroking the cane that caused this problem to begin with I love that caning is still a punishment in Australia Singapore. He's Australian but the offenses happened in Singapore. Oooohhh ok, that makes more sense then I *wish* that caning were still a punishment in Australia.  Seriously, for moderate-severity offences (vandalism, shoplifting and the like) I think it's actually pretty damn good. Give someone a $100,000 fine and they probably can't afford to pay it. Give them a six months in prison, and they probably come out a worse criminal. But give them a hundred lashes and they've had a cheap, efficient, easy punishment which will make them think twice about doing it again.    An we get the cane thing in America please? Honestly, I think it would be a great idea. If you have me the option between a couple canings or months in jail, I'd pick the canings, spend a couple days recovering and move on with my life I don't think it's an option. You don't learn how to be a better criminal when you're caned.  You go into jail a novice and come out in a few months a pro. Can we get the cane thing in Alabama, please?  .   .   I'm Talking to You, Roy Moore...!
 I would like to see what the suspect ended up looking like and how closely it matches the "sketch." https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2017/11/18/Screen_Shot_2017-11-18_at_16.26.07_c0-0-824-481_s885x516.png?d90833d45d0923d8eee3653bae0892585d16556b  Yep, that's a white guy alright. Better give myself up! How the hell did they decided what his hairstyle is? He's a white guy. There's like, three, tops. 3 styles? Haha. Funny joke. But, I'm curious why a mock up would have styled hair. Why not use generic long, medium, short modifiers. Wouldn't using such a specific style on a mock up be more of a hindrance? My guess is that the police were clutching at straws and they knew it, or the company behind the phenotyping is trying to make their results look more impressive than they really are (they basically amount to hair colour, eye colour, and maybe a rough guess at face shape). This is utter hogwash. Current widely accepted forensic science is questionable at best. The error on this thing must be through the roof. You're not supposed to use junk science as evidence (they do), but you are fully allowed to use it (and any other form of lie) to coerce someone to confess. Oh you can fuck right the fuck off. The more and more we learn about epigenetic influences on phenotypic expression the more we learn that DNA phenotyping is complete bullshit. Forensic science is basically a long string of pseudoscience that they peddle to cops who don’t know any better. It worked with the polygraph test, it’ll work with this as well.   "They asked me if I had a degree in Forensic Science.  I told them I had a Pseudodegree in Forensic Science and they said welcome aboard." Can confirm. Worked as a forensic psuedoscientist until I got a big boy job. I tried to suggest this, and asked how true was this on another thread and was berated for “not believing in DNA and science”   like I have an engineering degree fuck right off Everyone saying the "sketch" looks just like the guy. It doesn't look like him at all. Probably because they can only make a wild guess on just eye, hair and skin color but the face is just the white guy "template". They can't guess what someones lips might look like or what their face structure might look like. I have seen some police sketches from when I was in my CSI program that were incredibly close, but you are right, this is no where near as close. The nose is very different; the suspect's nostrils are wider than the sketch. They did get the suspect's jawline almost, however it's a bit more pointed at the sides than the sketch. His lips are also not right in the sketch; the corners of his mouth are pointed upward whereas the sketch's lips are flat all around. His ears even look off.  I'm glad the guy came forward but if I had known the guy and seen that sketch, I would have never guessed it was him because it's not him. It may certainly look like someone out there in the world but in itself is problematic as it could have caused people to point fingers at the wrong person and prolonged the search for the right person.    It looks like the suspect has had at least one broken nose, but the overall face shape is the same. Would need to see a decent sample of what the computer thinks and compare them to the actual individuals sampled to see how far off the generated portraits are.  I hope it’s not possible. Here’s their website: https://snapshot.parabon-nanolabs.com I like how most of the examples represent the same hair length of the suspect at the time of  booking. A few others look nothing like the detained suspect.  I worry about people like myself who purchased the Ancestry DNA whose T&amp;C's list a stipulation that Acenstry DNA has full ownership rights of your DNA sample.  For what I got out of Ancestry DNA, it's not worth the risk that one day it becomes legal for some F.B.I. agent might subpeona my DNA sample for a composite image such as this. Not even close, unless all white people look alike to you. They have been able to do this for several years now and most people didn't know.  Not a dead ringer but pretty darn close.  https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/nov/18/ryan-riggs-texas-man-confesses-murder-dna-image/ Holy shit. OPs article doesn't show the suspect. That is a disturbingly good rendition of the kid.  Really? Disturbingly good? same hair and skin and eye color.  And the same nose, and the hair type. It's more accurate than many witness sketches.   I've done professional portraits and that is *not* the same nose. That suspect looks like he's had a couple of broken noses. what? it looks nothing like him
 &gt; Then “Today” co-host Meredith Vieira was especially crude, making jokes about Lauer and Roker partaking in anal sex during the Turin Olympics, with Roker as the receiving partner.  Lmao.  &gt; But the most cringeworthy comments, in hindsight, were made by Lauer himself, who spoke at the end of the roast. The “Today” star alluded to sex with two former colleagues, Couric and Curry.  &gt;“Let me just say that I saw that colon a lot before the rest of you saw it,” Lauer said in an anal sex joke about Couric (who famously underwent a colonoscopy on air).  Holy shit. I'm dead. I have an abnormally high disdain for these morning shows. The combination of reporting absolutely nothing of substance and the uner fake sunny attitudes makes it really hard to digest.   The fact that these guys joke around like frat boys and then go on camera and act like Mormons having the best day of their life feels really gross.  You'd hate Family Home Evening. And early morning seminary teachers  Youth conference testimony meetings &gt; Mormons having the best day of their life  So like, their wedding day, after the reception is finally over and they get to have sex after 22 long years of feeling guilty for masturbation?  I've always wondered who watches these morning shows.  Most of us are scrambling around to get out and on the road.  Stay home Moms?  They are even busier pushing around bunch of school aged kids to get up, wash up, eat breakfast and get to school.  So really, who watches these shows? it's mostly stay at home moms. Or retired partners who are SUPPOSED to have the laundry and lunches made by 5:30.  TOM! Good to know their minds are being turned into mush by these things.  You sound like them describing video games. My mom used to have it on in the background while getting ready for work in the morning. My mom turns it on the morning while she gets ready or while she's doing puzzles on her iPad or something. They suck but I prefer it to the endless home improvement shows she seems to watch. Charlie Rose bullshit aside, CBS This Morning has been solidly really good with its focus on actual news. Today was the #1 rated morning news program so somebody's watchin Sounds like a good time to me. Sure it looks bad in retro but I love working somewhere where I am free to be this open and crude at times.   Now I just have to make sure I never harass someone and have to try and explain jokes I cracked 10 years prior.  &gt;Now I just have to make I never harass someone and have to try and explain jokes I cracked 10 years prior.  We are all.screwed if people look back at jokes we made 10 years ago.  I don't think anyone will run for office 50 years from now.   "Your political stance is impressive, but what do you have to say about this Facebook post you made when you were 14?" Or they'll be Super Mormons I've actually been thinking about this a lot. I used to work in an office with 2 women who loved to tell dirty jokes. They would force us to relive all of their sexual exploits, drag us to strip clubs, and have contests to find the raunchiest porn.  A buddy ex-coworker of mine ran into one of them a while back and the craziness came up. She was in total denial, and claimed that she was upset at the atmosphere that WE created. She was the instigator of EVERYTHING. Now she wants a reckoning.  It's a crazy time we are entering.  yeah same. one coworker at a former job of mine had a guy fired for sending her creepy messages on facebook. couple days later i walk up into a conversation with her and another female worker talking about whos hot, who theyd fuck, ect.   to be fair us dudes were saying the same about them, but we didnt send creepy messages so no one gave a shit. "Oh wow, isn't it amazing how people have such awful memories?  They can't remember how things happened at all.  Fortunately I remember exactly how it really happened."  Just keep it in mind. I worked with a woman who would regularly don a pair of costume devil horns and dance around saying "I'm horny, I'm horny", and we were all supposed to laugh. It was appalling. This is why the culture changed, it reached peak lunacy. Women were disparaging themselves because they couldn't tell a proper joke like guys.  Try 5 years. Am i supposed to be outraged at this, seems like co workers joking about each other.   I don't know why the world (and reddit) is shocked about these types of revelations.  People get old and gain life experience.  Do people think 60 year old women and men get to be 60+ years old and haven't had sex, threesomes, one nighters, drunken stupid decisions, and other sexcapades?  Humans aren't innocent. It's not like they say that shit on live TV.  People have personal lives. People have weird fetishes or things that they're crazy about with sex. These are also people who lived in a time when you could do/say something without 20 people recording it and "snapchatting" it for the nosy fucking world to  see.  Harassment and inappropriate humor have been around since apes branched off into fucking humans. I don't see us stopping it now. Just don't go overboard and psycho about it. Punish the rapists like Harvey. Don't crucify people who you think are supposed to be stepford wives and Christian gentlemen. &gt;Harassment and inappropriate humor  ...are *completely* different from each other.   Full stop. I am in my early 60s and definitely have had my share of intimate moments, but they have all been with willing partners and I have never made crude jokes about them. You have never made a crude sex joke? Not really - certainly not about anyone I know. I must admit that there seems to be a lot of opportunity for "that's what she said" comments though.  I member the rumors were for years that him and Couric were an item She sounds like a bit of a pocket rocket. I can imagine she's wild in bed   The part with Tom Cruise was interesting.  I was surprised that he showed up to roast Lauer given their feud at the time.    Scientology will do anything to stay relevant and in (bed) with the media. Cruise gets the most leeway in terms of hanging out with ppl who might be hostile to Scientology. Given the concentration of media execs at this thing, the Scientos were probably spying harder than the village voice. Interesting that Tony Ortega was the writer. He is now famously working with former members to publicize the dark side of the church on [his website The Underground Bunker.](http://www.tonyortega.org) Hey! Don't be glib JasonOfStarCommand. You don't even know what Ritalin *is*! &gt;Comedian Gilbert Gottfried was so obscene that Fox News can’t even publish a highly expurgated version of his material, but part of his racist routine – filled with Asian sex jokes about Ann Curry –included detailed remarks about Curry’s genitals.  Somebody file a freedom of information claim  &gt; Gilbert Gottfried was so obscene that Fox News can’t even publish a highly expurgated version of his material   If you are surprised by this, you’ve never seen Gottfried at a roast.  There are no holds barred  He made a joke at the Hefner roast about being late because his flight had a connection with the Empire State Building, this was 3 weeks after 9/11. he also made a joke to pete davidson about his dad being ashy  his dad died as a firefighter on 9/11 This cost him his gig as the voice of the Aflac duck He lost his Aflac gig for tweeting jokes about the Japanese tsunami like as it was happening.  The jokes were pretty funny at least. Yeah, something about Japanese men not being depressed after being dumped by their girlfriends because new one would float by any minute.  Which I'm not ok with. I loved him as that duck  He was a good duck Isn't there a documentary being released on him? I'm going to shoot some of you white motherfuckers and rape some of you white bitches   - Gilbert Gottfried his "The Aristocrats" was classic. Right up there with Chaplain's greatest moments.   "I didn't know that could be an art, but he just invented, defined, and perfected it, all in one go." I still think that Stanhope's version is the best one. When he was on the Norm Macdonald show and they riffed for like an hour about how the co host ate out hitler’s asshole. Fucking hilarious.  Did you at least think about bringing them to justice, afterwards? As is tradition for a roast. Nor holes, apparently  Bet he said it was sideways. That's the usual go to joke.  &gt;http://snltranscripts.jt.org/00/00ptoughguy.phtml  SNL did it in 2001, too. S26E16, April 7th.  &gt;Now, I don't pretend to know who these Chinese people are - I know they're small, maybe 1 or 2 feet high! I know they sound funny when they talk, I know the womenfolk have sideways vaginas  's a popular joke, it seems. That joke was old when I was a kid (back in the 70s). It probably dates back to WWI or earlier. I have no idea what this joke is supposed to mean... It's a reference to Asian eyes Me too.  I have lived in East Asia for 20 years, and thought I'd heard all the racist tropes, but... That one, no.  ive almost only heard it from military guys that were stationed in vietnam or philipines   except an old mexican told me about it recently, so its gotten around for a while The one I remember as a kid was something like - "Q:  What sound does an [insert asian country] girl make going down a slide?   A:  *Makes motorboat sound with finger over lips*" Here you go man, its filthy.   https://www.villagevoice.com/2008/10/24/matt-lauers-roast-tom-cruise-katie-couric-and-3-hours-of-dick-jokes/ Wow. 2008 is centuries away from 2017 in terms of culture isn’t it.  It works both ways. Some stuff was acceptable back then not today and vice versa. That was fucking beautiful.   Holy fuck. Are we seriously starting witch hunts over comedy routines now? Do people not see how puritanical and authoritarian this is becoming at an alarming speed? I mean I was joking. I don’t really care. But from a liability standpoint we should all stop talking to each other.  I'm alleging harassment at you! Doesn't work for private companies.  It was just a joke.  Locker room talk &gt;Somebody file a freedom of information claim.  So do it.  &gt; Somebody file a freedom of information claim   Sadly, this only works with the government. Holy shit I forgot about Ann Curry. I swear I saw that woman more than my own mother. isn't gilbert Asian himself. might just have skinny eyes. but he can't be racist against Asians if he's Asian. like black people can say the horrible n word. precedence set. Just turn on Howard stern. You'll figure it out. &gt;But a shot at Lauer’s in-office relationship with Curry, who was in the room, got the biggest laugh of Couric’s routine.  &gt;“No. 2 - He loves to eat Curry,” she said as Curry (sitting in the audience) went pale and the crowd roared with laughter. “What? Indian food! What’s wrong with you people?”    Katie Couric can do standup. Who knew? Meh, it was a little obvious. And if Curry had not publicly acknowledged the relationship prior to this joke, that's kind of super-uncool of couric.  Edit because I thought about the joke some more and read up on Lauer and Curry's relationship: If Couric said that joke then she is the worst.  So Lauer and Curry apparently clearly never liked each other (I didnt know, dont watch morning news). However, Couric and Lauer worked well together. So at an event designed to consensually mock Lauer, Couric made jokes implying Curry slept with a man she publicly disliked to get her job. Lauer wasn't the butt of that joke, Curry was. It cast her as a woman that slept her way up the corporate ladder, as well as implying she let a man she hated sleep with her. That is such a gross move. That is so gross. Poor Ann.  It was a roast. Roasts are raunchy, nasty affairs. If you don’t want to be the butt if a joke, don’t show up. Rules of the roast are there are no rules. No subject is off limits, no person is sacred. The rules of normal etiquette and discourse do not apply and nothing should be taken seriously. The slightest personal flaws are exaggerated for comic effect.  This would have been better to watch than half the Comedy Central roasts. If you want a see a good roast look up the roast of Patrice O'Neal. The comics just tear into each other and it's great. I listen to it more than most stand up specials. Patrice was truly a legend. I remember listening to Opie and Anthony the day after he died and they had all his comedian friends in the studio and all they did was roast each other for hours. They said it's what he would have wanted.  That Louis CK roast of the way Bobby Kelly talks is one of the funniest things I've ever heard. Especially when Bobby calls in and is just fucking furious. Man, I wish that era didn't end.  Me too, I used to look forward to my commute when those guys were in studio. Or worse, the Howard Stern “roasts” which are garbage shit shows.  Makes you wonder who else out there “everyone” knows about but aren’t mentioning. whoever has a door lock button under their desks.  I mean, some of the stuff, like Louis CK, I'm like "Okay, I mean, at least he asked, even if it wasn't a fair situation for these women."  At what point can you get a door-lock button installed on your desk and think it's okay?  How do you even explain it to the install guy? lol Actually, from what I've read the door-lock button is not that unusual in high-end executive offices. It's so they can lock the door and get some respite from the constant intrusions, without having to get up and do it themselves. It's intended purpose isn't to function as a rape-trap. In access control, doors should always allow free egress. A lock on the door is fine so long as you can still open the door while in the room. Having a button to hit under a desk to allow exit isn't cool. No idea how this was set up, but sounds suspect. Oh, no doubt it’s against building code. I’m just saying it wasn’t uncommon, and the purpose wasn’t to enable rape. &gt; How do you even explain it to the install guy?  "I'd like to be able to lock the door without getting up from my desk". Pretty reasonable. “I don’t want the interior door handle to work though, just this hidden button” sounds worse.  "and about the trap door..."  "muffle the sounds coming from this room..." &gt;  How do you even explain it to the install guy  "I'm worried about terrorists or some armed nut coming into the building, I'd like to be able to lock my office door instantly, without having to get up or even move an inch. What do you recommend?"  There you go. Seems pretty easy to explain. And the reason why, when you do it, the door handle doesn't work?   “Oh, also creepy sex dungeon.”   Ask.Matt Lauer As a security measure if some nutjob with a gun got into the office. The problem arises when the door is locked both from the outside **AND** the inside. Most people have to submit requisition forms in triplicate to get a new pencil sharpener, but somehow Lauer gets a fancy door-locking-button installed in his desk. Jerry Seinfeld.  Donald Trump? I mean, we rewarded his behavior.   It seems clear we have an endemic problem in this country in regards to sexual misconduct. It seems to traverse state, local, and party lines. Yet we do nothing about it even when our elected officials are part of the problem.  The thing is, it's only recently that it's started to SEEM like a problem. We're undergoing a cultural shift right now (by "right now" I mean in the last decade or so). Thirty years ago, this was just "men behaving like men" sort of stuff. Sixty years ago it didn't even raise an eyebrow, and was just how the world worked.   I think it’s pretty clear Trump’s *not* someone  everyone knows about but no one’s mentioning like Lauer, Weinstein, Conley, Bush Sr, etc. There is a chunk of this nation so large that hates trump if there were any actual sexual assault charges to be known they would be known. [Here's a list](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/11/what-happened-to-trumps-16-sexual-misconduct-accusers.html)  Many of these came out decades before he ever ran for president.  &gt;In 1997 Harth and Houraney sued Trump for breach of contract, and she filed a separate sexual-harassment suit, accusing him of “attempted rape.” They reached a confidential settlement in the contract suit, and as part of the agreement Harth withdrew her suit.  Convincing someone to accuse him of attempted rape in 1997 in order to sabotage him in 2017 is **true** 4D chess.  &gt;The allegation: The journalist claimed that Trump pushed her against a wall and forced his tongue down her throat while giving her a tour of Mar-a-Lago. Stoynoff was working on a profile of the Trumps, and said that while waiting for Melania to arrive for an interview, Donald told her, “You know we’re going to have an affair, don’t you?”  &gt;She said he also referenced a New York Post cover published during his affair with Marla Maples. “You remember,” he said. “‘Best Sex I Ever Had.’”  He's a real quality act, indeed. This was okay in the 90s.  [Tfw there's a whole wikipedia page about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_sexual_misconduct_allegations) The same people that hid Lauer and Weinstein have been calling Trump a sexist rapist every single day.  You'd have to be an insane partisan hack to try and deflect blame off the enablers of those men onto Trump. And trump also supported a pedophile in Alabama.  Funny how that works out. &gt; You'd have to be an insane partisan hack to try and deflect blame off the enablers of those men onto Trump.  Wait, why are you trying to deflect blame from those men onto some mysterious "enablers" here?  Nor was anybody -- even for a second -- *blaming* Trump. You're just trying to be a victim here. Poor Trump! The world is so mean to him!!!  Edit: Figured the first part out. If it's the fault of these "enablers," then it's really the fault of the eeeeeeevil liberal meeeeeedia instead of just Lauer being an shithead. I condemn ALL of them for their blatant disregard for, and active oppression of, the basic human right we ALL have to not be groped, molested or assaulted. We ALL should be able to decide who does and who does not get to put their hands on us. I hope justice is served on ANYONE who violates another person in these ways. Trump could sexually assault someone on live television and his supporters would blame Hillary Clinton\Obama\George Soros\Jews He could shoot someone, and still support him. He's really the only thing America got going for it after liberals ruined it. Like that Iraqi said last year, Saddam killed my whole family but I still supported him and wish he was still president.  Probably the victims should talk to the police if they want to tackle such a big fish. It's hard for a verbal accusation during an election to hold much merit on its own. It’s a fucking roast.  You’re allowed to let go and make lewd jokes.   &gt; You're allowed to let go and make lewd jokes.  I thought it was frowned upon to _not_ tell lewd jokes at roasts. &gt;I thought it was frowned upon to not tell lewd jokes at roasts.  Hence the brilliance of Norm MacDonald.  https://streamable.com/yg6ut  Anyone who hasn't seen this ought too.  Comedians were encouraged to be as filthy as possible.  Norm doesn't take direction well. One of the best bombing sets I've seen. Fuckin Norm. He did a set of nothing but dad jokes. I fucking love it. It's Fox News reporting. They're hoping people don't make the connection with how Matt Lauer got fired for his crimes as where Fox News just tried to quiet down people that accused Bill O'Reilly of his crimes. after reading the jokes that were made, i think this is a stretch. it looks like they make as many gay jokes as office jokes and theres been nothing about Matt Lauer being secretly gay.   im sure they all knew, and this behavior has been referenced by others in the past, but a comedic roast full of raunchy jokes doesnt really prove anything Other than they all lack imagination. For all that is secret will eventually be brought into the open, and everything that is concealed will be brought to light and made known to all. Hail Jeebus. So these people were willing participants in the jokes and were vilifying them for it? Yeah, I didn't see anything wrong with this. Consenting adults gathered privately to make crude jokes about each other. So? They're villifying the execs who are saying, "We had no idea Matt was a horn-dog perving on all the women in the office!"  Meanwhile they attended, and in some cases participated in, a roast that was all about horn-dog Matt and his pervy office escapades. You seem trustworthy, guy with random string of numbers username who mostly talks about politics Everybody is Russian except you. Anyway, what do you think I should order for dinner? I've been eating junk all week, and I'm fed up of everything around me.  *We* aren't vilifying them for it. Fox News is...the same organization that covered this kind of stuff up for decades with Ailes and O'Reilly. Don't forget to look at what outlet is reporting this...  "media elites" is a very specific, loaded choice of words I felt so bad for Ann Curry.  I'm shocked at Meredith Vieira! I'm having a shocked Captain Renault moment here.     I'm coming around to the conclusion that this behaviour was common, and acceptable at the time it occurred  This just shows that he was known as a manwhore, something completely different than rapist. I don't know about you guys but I've been getting quite a thrill out of this. I've always disliked Matt Lauer for some reason.. and now I know why...  Any guy that would drive a bus over his wife and kids **so he get his dick wet** is a fucking loser. The guy has always come off to me as being really sleazy and full of himself. While there have been some accusations against people that I found shocking, when I first heard the news about Lauer I just thought "yeah, that sounds about right". I wasn't surprised that he turned out to be the kind of dude to sexually harass his coworkers at all.  ITT: people who don't know what a roast is Haven't seen Fox news on here in a while No, this story is bullshit.    Friar’s club roasts are notoriously dirty, and reference little ducks, not satisfying wives, gay sex with close friends, and general vulgarity.   No matter who was being roasted, jokes like that were going to be made.    So joking about him eating (Ann) Curry? That doesn’t signal anything at ALL.    Now, if there were jokes about him chasing interns or locking his door? That would tell me that they knew. But the jokes in this article were positively generic: Lauer is gay and can’t satisfy his wife, Bryant Gumble is white, Al Roker is black and fat, the women are promiscuous. These are the absolute most generic roast jokes imaginable.    I’m not saying no one knew—-I don’t know who knew what. But this article describes a roast that is in every way the same thing that’d be said about any dude, UNLESS they dude is a known prude like Pence or Romney, in which case the jokes will be about fear of sex and closeted gayness.    I don’t give a damn about Lauer or NBC execs, but I HATE this kind of journalism, that is pretending to have uncovered some elite conspiracy when in reality, a roast is a bunch of lewd jokes that are outrageous on purpose and need have no truth to them.  Its a post-joke world didnt yah know. It's a post-joke world they themselves created. Now they get to wallow in their own mess.  All the things coming out now are probably just the tip of the iceberg. What a deliberately obnoxious Fox News title. I do have a good laugh anytime one of these people's colleagues get on camera or in the papers and try to tell us with a straight face that they had no idea this was going on.  Lauer's colleagues deserve acting awards for the performance they put on the morning he was fired.  I am excited to see Bill O'Rileys response...haven't see him in a while....what's he up too? I love when the liberal elites and their media puppets preach about women's rights and sexual assault..... and then get caught with their hands up someone's skirt.  I'm surprised this news outfit leaked Trumps "grab them by the pussy" audio bit without just once looking into the mirror and seeing the irony in them calling out Trump over *his* behavior (and NO, I do not endorse Trumps comment one bit either).  It's just funny to me; "OMG did you hear what Trump said??  Unbelievable!"  vs. "Everyone knows Lauer likes to eat Curry!" and *everyone* just laughs in her face Yeah, it's clearly not an issue limited to one political group or nationality. Any attempt to frame it like that is unacceptable.   However, there is an enormous difference between a media darling being a secret monster and the leader of the free world being a public monster. It's the difference between "this is bad" and "holy crap, things are THIS bad?!" Tbf, no media figures would have lost their jobs had they not branded Trump's behavior as the epitome of abuse of women. And now, media figures have disproportionately been affected by the ongoing scandals. Ironic.  True. Trump's presidency definitely has helped stoke public concern over our culture's weirdly condoning behavior towards sexual predation.  Hopefully this movement neither quickly dies or escalates to a point that baseless accusations carry immediate repercussions beyond the unavoidable. Not to mention a huge difference between Lauer's bosses finding out about serious allegations and immediately firing him, and the Republican public hearing Donald Trump on tape admitting to serious sexual predation and them still elect him anyway. "Immediately" firing him 10 years after an entire room of people apparently publicly roasted him over it. Not sure how immediate you can call that, unless some how everyone but his bosses knew about it back in 2008. It's more like the immediately fired him once the public became outraged and they had to for PR purposes.  A joke at a roast is not a serious allegation.  Unless, of course, you are saying that the jokes at Donald Trump's roast should be treated that way.  Are you?  Because there were jokes about him raping his wife and fucking his daughter in there. Comedy, especially roasts, often contain elements of truth. You think it is just a coincidence that multiple people at that event made jokes about his treatment of women? Look at the other roasts and what the over all theme of those roasts were, they're commonly based on truthful aspects of the guest of honor's life. Trump raping his ex (which she accused him of), Hasselhoff's alcohol issues, Pam's sex tape, Leary stealing jokes...  If you think the entertainment industry got together and collectively roasted this guy over his womanizing, yet no one knew or suspected he was actually doing it, I have a bridge to sell you.  &gt;Comedy, especially roasts, often contain elements of truth.  Then from the article:  &gt;Then “Today” co-host Meredith Vieira was especially crude, making jokes about Lauer and Roker partaking in anal sex during the Turin Olympics, with Roker as the receiving partner.  Matt Lauer was fucking Al Roker in the ass?! &gt; Comedy, especially roasts, often contain elements of truth.  Not even close to true &gt; Lauer's bosses finding out about serious allegations and immediately firing him  Yes, they totally just recently found out about them.  /s  Not everyone that has been accused is a monster. I could not care less that Dustin Hoffman grabbed someone's bottom, or Jeffrey Tambor made a scandalous proposition. This exactly.  Regardless of political preference, American society is changing before our eyes. [deleted] And yet the media loves to lecture us about how bad Trump is...  Projection, mayhaps? That's dumb. This behavior is wrong no matter where it occurs. More like hypocrisy and propaganda. It's like how whoopi defends child rapists like roman polanski and serial rapists like bill cosby while attacking trump for his silly comments. It's like how the media joked about "Slick Willy" raping/molesting interns at the oval office while slamming trump for his silly comments.  Funny how JFK kept a stable of teenagers as his prostitutes and the media invented the bullshit about "Camelot".  It's almost like the idiots running news organizations are biased agenda driven propagandists.  And Fox News proceeds to be offended by celebrity roasts.  Honestly folks, I realize this is "low hanging fruit", but it's not especially interesting.   So did any actual harassment take place here?
 Why didn't local authorities get involved before this happened?  Probably busy busting pot smokers and speeders. there is a special place in hell for these parents
 &gt; Pfizer Inc. will begin selling the white pill at half the $65-a-pill retail price on Monday, when its patent-protected monopoly ends. Generic maker Teva Pharmaceuticals can start selling its version then, but isn’t disclosing the price.  O so back to 2013 prices of the drug? 32 dollars per boner still sounds steep as fuck.  Wait till you're in your 70s, my boy. Back in my day we had to shove a wasp up our urethra to get an erection. And we liked it!  There has to be a huge market for fake viagra. I can get fake xanax literally anywhere and it still has the real ingredients, I would hope the same is happening with viagra lol It is. There's fake Cialis and Levitra too, and even combos. It's 1/10th the price and works just as well. I heard. I hard Yep. Most of the good stuff comes from India. Have you ever looked in your spam folder? There is you can literally purchase online from India, and have it mailed to your house for the low low price of $0.36 a pill It is fun to see the number of FDA warnings sent to nutraceutical manufacturers whose products are “contaminated” with viagra.   Ever been to Mexico?  We were hounded by hawkers at the tourist attractions - "Viagra! Viagra!" they would shout at my girlfriend.  She spoke fluent Spanish and responded "No necesito!" and I would strut by smugly.  lol &gt; There has to be a huge market for fake viagra. I can get fake xanax literally anywhere and it still has the real ingredients, I would hope the same is happening with viagra lol  That's considered generic, not fake. Fake would be something that doesn't work at all. Well by fake I meant it's pressed on the streets by "drug dealers" rather than legally produced. Obviously a health concern tho I think you mean off brand. Outside of the US you can get generic viagra for about $1 per pill, sold in packs of 4.  Or actually even lower than that. A pack of 12 of 100mg generic sits here at around 5€ I forgot where I read this recently,but one country in Europe is about to OTC Viagra. As they should. We just walk into a pharmacy and buy it here too, it’s nice. trust me, the shit is epic.  The smurf vision sucked but the hardons?  GODDAMN do they go for hours!!!   Over and over too,  with quick reset  times.  I used to have a sex addict GF that would get one for me when she got her party drugs.  Better put a rubber on it. Else it ends up being a million dollar boner &gt; 32 dollars per boner still sounds steep as fuck.  How many times are you going to be fucking if you're an old man? Once a month?  And back to 2013 profitability. Big issue in the board room. You can only renew your patent so many times before it goes generic. Unfortunately, they were unable to find "something" that would force them to re-patent. Unlike, Albuterol http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/us/the-soaring-cost-of-a-simple-breath.html?pagewanted=all   But even if they can change it a bit, the original formula can still be produced by anyone else. But you can just market the new version to idiot consumers as 'superior', send a few thousand urologists to 'speaking conferences' where they're paid to have lunch and commence a 2 week vacation, so they'll prescribe it. Bada Bing Bada boom, billions in profit and higher insurance costs for everyone!   This is actually how it happens and has been happening for decades. &gt; This is actually how it happens and has been happening for decades.  That ended circa 2009ish. Great for society, bummer for surgical subspecialists. The evidence was undeniable, though, that even a goddamn pen influences prescribing behavior, so "speaking events" in Hawaii were just too obvious a conflict.  The sunshine act helped but it still does happen &gt;Big issue in the board room.  That sounds like a euphemism for "can't get boners" that you'd hear in a Viagra commercial. Really? Pfizer is selling both the original and the generic. That drug has been all profit for years. Now people will buy more because of the price drop thinking they are getting a good deal on the generic. But pfizer has been slowly raising the price for years in anticipation of the generic rollout. But many people will also still insist on buying the identical name brand at the much higher cost.       Pfizer knows what it's doing. ...viagra is $65 fucking dollars a pill? Here it is $74. You have to go to Canada/elsewhere to get them. Stiff prices That makes me giggle.  In the UK we sell them off private prescriptions for the generic version for about £1/tablet.  And they've announced that pharmacies will soon be able to sell it without a prescription.  I guess that's what happens when you apply a capitalist ethos to healthcare. &gt;  I guess that's what happens when you apply a capitalist ethos to healthcare.  It says something that the capitalist company was the one that came up with the med in the first place. Considering US does 95%+ of the medical research in the world, none of these countries would have these medicines to begin with.  Viagra was produced by researchers in England.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sildenafil#History &gt;Sildenafil (compound UK-92,480) was synthesized by a group of pharmaceutical chemists working at Pfizer's Sandwich, Kent, research facility in England. It was initially studied for use in hypertension (high blood pressure) and angina pectoris (a symptom of ischaemic heart disease). The first clinical trials were conducted in Morriston Hospital in Swansea.[40] Phase I clinical trials under the direction of Ian Osterloh suggested the drug had little effect on angina, but it could induce marked penile erections. Can confirm.  I know a PhD who was there at the time.  By his account they were very excited at the discovery. &gt; they were very excited at the discovery  Aroused even They didn’t do it for the UK money... &gt; Viagra was produced by researchers in England.  I mean shit id need a few of them pills myself to get it up with a british girl. even your royalty is hotepping over to the winning side. That is to say my man, the black side.  Honestly how yall managed to reproduce on that tiny ass island for thousands of generations is just beyond me. If I were a norman invader id look at those razor-toothed land whales and take my skinny invading ass back to omaha.   I mean really, anyone with a damn noodle coulda told you viagra came from england Calm down, kid. Did your mom finally let you use the big boy internet or something? Don't just make up information to support whatever you feel should be true. Not true, from the top 20 pharma companies 10 are in the US: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_pharmaceutical_companies_by_revenue . Why the heck would the US produce 95% of the medical research? &gt; Why the heck would the US produce 95% of the medical research?  To prop up the "We pay more for healthcare because we pay for everyone's research!" lie. False information everywhere.  According to tax filings, 0% of research is done in the us. Only Ireland, grand came and Cyprus. (I'm only somewhat kidding) &gt; grand came   Freudian slip in a Viagra thread. That's not true.  https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/01/02/us-medical-research-spending-drops-while-asia-makes-gains Anyone praising the way China and company conducts research knows absolutely nothing about how research actually works. The work coming out of China right now is either stolen, academically weak, or ethically questionable in a way that should make any reasonable person squirm. The US may be spending a little less but we still lead the globe in quality research, full stop. But not 95% as was claimed. Period. While pharmaceutical companies get most of the credit for these discoveries, most of the research for life-saving medication is done by the university system.  This is, unfortunately, going to change significantly with the new tax bill.  Once in effect, the new tax bill will raise taxes on the graduate students doing most of this research [by 400%](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/16/house-gop-tax-plan-could-increase-taxes-for-grad-students-by-400-percent.html).  In order to maintain our advantage in pharmaceutical research, universities would have to be willing to significantly increase the amount of grants they provide to these researchers, or they will be forced to leave their labs for other work.  While many of them will be able to move into industry, it should be noted that for-profit pharmaceutical research companies are incentivized towards inventing treatments rather than cures.  You cannot create a customer base with a cure.  Within 5 years, we're also going to start seeing problems with finding qualified researchers to do this work.  Not only will domestic students find it substantially more difficult to survive the years it takes to earn a graduate degree, we have already started seeing a drop in international students coming to the US as the cultural climate turns increasingly hostile towards foreigners.  It won't be long until our claims of subsidizing the world's pharmaceutical research is just more hot air used to justify the most expensive medical system the world has ever seen. That isn’t true at all.  It has been a few years since I checked, but the entire NIH budget was only 3x that of Pfizer’s R&amp;D spend.  Yes, how dare graduate students working as researchers pay taxes on what is effectively wages.  If a university's graduate students are doing research, those students should be treated like employees. This whole system of giving students free tuition and a stipend is just skirting the system. Or we cut these students a small break while they complete the necessary education and training required to become some of the most important pieces of America's continued advanced leadership in technology, science, and medicine. They're not making exorbitant sums. It's more like modest housing relatively close to campus and usually with roommates, staple foodstuffs, tuition assistance, and enough extra to see a movie every month or so to keep them from going insane.  &gt; what is effectively wages  It's not It is.  It really isn't.  Definitely is. You have a point (though I disagree that education grants should be considered the same as wages), but that doesn't change the fact that we're creating an economical problem with no planned solution.  Pricing graduate students out of doing pharmaceutical research is not going to allow us to maintain our dominance in the market. Oh I'm not asking for the university research program to end, only to start acting like it really is: Fee for Service.  So if grad students are getting priced out, universities should switch to a system that pays their student researchers a salary that the students then pay taxes on.  &gt; Fee for Service.  If you require universities to hire students researchers as researchers instead of students, where does the money come from to pay them?  Subsidies have been cut back by DeVos and don't look to be returning as long as Republicans have control.  If the money is to come from the market, where?  People invest when they believe they'll have a high ROI.  Researching a cure for a disease that afflicts 10,000 people would have a terrible ROI, even if you charged way more than the patients could reasonably be expected to afford.  But a University program can pursue it under a Government grant.  And regarding the students themselves, it's not as if it isn't a mutually beneficial situation.  Companies that pay good money don't want to spend years training people who can leave whenever they like.  And most of them aren't very good at training anyway.  Universities are the only currently feasible way to get the kind of education you need to compete for research jobs, even if they get away with more than we'd like with regard to compensation.  Is the solution to regulate how Universities handle their student researchers?  Or is the solution to dramatically raise the student's taxes and see if the problem fixes itself?  It probably will, but not in favor of the US economy. Shouldn't those students (who are really employees) be given a living wage and full access to health care, dental, vision, etc...?  It's the universities who are mistreating these people.  The government is only now pointing this out by eliminating the loophole these pseudo-corporations have been using to oppress their workers. Oh come on.  All they need to do is create a new regulation to classify student researchers differently.  In fact, that's what they're supposed to do.  Sabotaging their tax structure is either greedy or petty.  Either way is bad governance. Optionally, the colleges could just restructure the way they gift education. &gt; Shouldn't those students (who are really employees) be given a living wage and full access to health care, dental, vision, etc...?  And how does this change anything about how Universities are allowed to treat their student researchers?  The average grad student makes $30,000 (significantly above minimum wage) in addition to their tuition remittance (which I agree is a ridiculous way of handling their accounting).  You are giving them a pretty noble motivation considering that what they did doesn't actually do anything to fix the situation of these students except put both them and their universities into turmoil. The line I regularly hear for private businesses is that if their business model can't handle paying living wages and benefits to their workers, then they should go out of business.   Time for universities to start facing that too, instead of designating everyone "student-(another word for worker)" so they can exploit loopholes in Obamacare, workers compensation laws, tax laws, etc.   Many of the same people who endorse universities skirting these labor laws would be outraged if Pfizer tried to do the same for their employees - while at the same time they claim the student workers are doing more work in the field than corporate pharma employees. If they're doing the work, they're workers and deserve to be paid and protected and taxed as such.  And more importantly, those employees should be given living wages and health care.  The universities are basically operating a system that is only marginally better than chattel slavery. Capitalism, it's just what you need to make progress with healthcare. (Also wars, they're a good place to experiment with new techniques.) &gt; Considering US does 95%+ of the medical research in the world, none of these countries would have these medicines to begin with.  This is something to consider, too. People don't realize that big profits also drive innovation. It's kind of a necessary evil. Boom. Roasted.   /Dumdermifflin The pharmaceutical industry isn't healthcare.   healthcare relies on the pharmaceutical industry, your great healthcare in the UK can only hand out cheap viagra because someone else made it in the first place &gt; healthcare relies on the pharmaceutical industry  Which is a huge part of the problem. Healthcare has turned from treating illness to treating symptoms. Hence the last time a actual cure came on market. Hence why the cure to Hepatitis is highly dependent on the size of your bank account. People die from liver failure while a cure literally sits on some pharmacy shelf.  And your point is.....? that your "haha we have it great over here" attitude is only possible due to some other area being productive enough for you to mooch off You do know Viagra was synthesized in England, right?  Using which company again? And how are we mooching off people? [deleted] ...he’s making some good points. What part of what he’s saying makes him a “troll”? Is it the anti-socialist part? That is a bad idea.  People are going to die when they combine it with nitrates.  It'll only be available from pharmacies, i.e. a consultation with a pharmacist will be required before a sale is made.  And FYI, nitrates + sildenafil doesn't mean people are going to die.  When changing a medication's classification from prescription only   medication (POM) to pharmacy only medication (P), they consider potential for harm.  If it were that dangerous, it wouldn't be given a P classification.  And in case you didn't already know; sildenafil was originally intended as a drug for angina - it was during the clinical trials where they noticed the side effect it's famous for and Pfizer remarketed it as an ED drug. I’m guessing that given the popularity of even generic, pricing will continue to come down.  Price doesn't drop until a second generic manufacturer enters the market (Pfizer doesn't count, that's an authorized generic) It's already available as a generic. Not exactly. Generic sildenafil (Revatio) is available for heart conditions in a different dosage. You can take multiple Revatio tabs to get the same effect if your doctor will prescribe it. Any other generic 'Viagra' is a cheap Chinese or Indian knock off. If you want to take pills made with bathtub chemistry, knock yourself out.  Pfizer's generic will be the best because it will contain the same binders, really just the same pill in a different color. This is worth any price premium over Teva. I'm a pharmacist here in the UK.  We get legitimate generic sildenafil all the time because our doctors prescribe it frequently for erectile dysfunction.  And FYI, there's no "special recipe" for tablet binders because they're just bulking agents - all legitimate generics are required by law to show bioequivalent properties except in cases where the release mechanism is part of the drug's effects, e.g. modified release. Yeah, I got some sildenafil online. I should have gone to the Dr because they was quite expensive. Here in the UK you'll be able to buy it over the counter soon. Sweet Ray's All Natural Boner Juice.   Coming soon! &gt;  all legitimate generics are required by law to show bioequivalent properties  Not in all jurisdictions. Source: Legal at a Big Pharma company.   If you think binders can not affect drug performance you're uninformed. I've personally taken generics that behave rather differently than the branded versions, and had doctors complain to me about the same, to the point where they would only prescribe the brand. And no they weren't being compensated for it.  You comment about bioequivalence is technically correct but manufacturers only need to show that peak blood levels are the same, in tandem with general safety &amp; efficacy. Binders can be any GRAS stuff. Duration is not a requirement normally.  **Bottom line: not all binders are the same.**  &amp;nbsp;  Source: worked at Pfizer for an extended period  EDIT: downvotes from people who know fuck-all about process chemistry and drug manufacturing. Good one I never said that binders don't effect drug performance, I merely pointed out that the statement that a Pfizer "generic" is inherently superior to another manufacturer's generic because they use a special recipe of binders is bollocks. Fair enough. But 100% it will be superior because generic makers use the cheapest fucking binders available. And-  Put another way, Pfizer's 'generic' **will be the exact same pill** sans blue dye. I'll take those hundreds of millions of R&amp;D dollars over Teva and Dr. Reddy's chop shops any day. Any smart consumer would too.  They won't outright say it's the same pill because no one would spend more money for the blue version. This is the only reason for the marketing speak about special binders. Same factory, same pill, different color. And some of the highest manufacturing standards in the business. Teva can't claim that, and by default Teva will have more batch to batch variability.  If one wants to cheap out and buy Teva's product then great. Maybe it will work fine for them. The de minimis savings aren't worth it IMO. Teva is just one manufacturer that makes generic sildenafil.  We also get Zentiva, Mylan, Sandoz and Actavis made sildenafil.  And I'm now bored of the Pfizer lackey spiel.  Ta ta. Teva's my preferred brand for a drug I take for sleeping, trazadone. The pharmacy rotates a half dozen brands of the drug, and one of them doesn't work as well, so I believe it can happen, but it's really rare and there are alternatives that are just as good as the original manufacturer.  It's true that for whatever reason; some brands work differently for some people.  But that's the exception, not true for an entire clinical subgroup of patients. Yet you aren't tired of behaving like a twat, which will unfortunately continue the rest of your life I fear. And you Brits pride yourself on good manners.  I'm no fan of the place just because I worked there, I just know how they do things.  One can only hope you are less of a tosser with your customers. Sorry I just don't have any patience for witless worms.  ALL HAIL PFIZER!  P.S.  We have patients, not customers.  Unlike pricks like you we don't seek to cut a pound of flesh from sick people every chance we get.  Cunt face. I'm beginning to think that this guy isn't a pharmacist That guy has no idea what he's talking about, you're wasting your time. &gt;Fair enough. But 100% it will be superior because generic makers use the cheapest fucking binders available  is bullshit when you consider bioavailability.   Being a tech at a pharmaceutical company doesn't mean you understand the chemistry. You know how to follow a procedure, you don't know how to make one.  That guy is all but declaring that there really isn't a difference between generic and name brand drugs. I don't see how an actual pharmacist could say the things he's said.  Do they do online degrees in the UK for this sort of thing? There isn't a difference that is significant between name brand and generic. A pharmacist would say that because they are aware of what the laws are and the approval process for the manufacturing of a generic.   Ie generally lactose versus dextrose doesn't matter as a bulking agent He's declaring that there's not *necessarily* a difference, not that there's no difference at all. the only difference will be between generic and branded and not between other generics. (e.g all the pregablin drugs will be the same withing 1% but Lyrica will be a lot better than the generics but the price difference is £1 and £87) It does not take much to reverse engineer a tablet. Legit Indian or Chinese companies would have zero issue. From what I've seen, the "knock offs" from legit companies have similar efficacy at a fraction of the price.   &gt;generic makers use the cheapest fucking binders available  Not sure what you have against generics. Any imput into the manufacturing process goes through the same cGMP (or equivalent) checks and balances. Lay off the blue Kood-Aid.   Source: also worked for Pfizer    I've used the generic knock offs and they work wonderfully. Nothing against generics generally, I just see no point in buying a generic when the pioneer is available for close to the same price.  There are a bunch of idiots in the thread so I'm going to lay out a few things for the rest of us.  Reverse engineering the API sure, or a CR/ER formulation. But the whole pill? Not so much. They don't need to do this and will choose less expensive binders anyway because their margins are lower. Why is this hard for people to understand? This exactly. I've had meds that just wouldn't work when they switched to generic. Had to fight to get them back to regular. For the most part generics  have worked for me but once it failed spectacularly.  specific generics will have specific interactions with other drugs or conditions. The pharmacist / doctor should catch those cases and specify the label  the issue in the UK is that, if your doctor isnt prescribing you a branded version of the drug, youre going to get whatever the cheapest generic is as the NHS wont pay you for the branded unless specified on the prescription.   What a lot of people dont understand is that the generics such as amlodipine made by Almus and the amlodipine made by teva are really the same and lots of them are the same manufacturer, just different packaging but if there was a branded version called AMINEX and it was made by pfizer, did work better but costs double the price, no pharmacy will give it out unless its specified &gt;did work better  That only happens if the bioavailability is different which it cannot be for a generic. The threshold I *think* is 3% &gt;I've personally taken generics that behave rather differently than the branded versions, and had doctors complain to me about the same, to the point where they would only prescribe the brand. And no they weren't being compensated for it.  This is anecdotal.   &gt;Source: worked at Pfizer for an extended period  It makes sense that someone who worked for pfizer would have a negative *opinion* of generics. That doesn't make your anecdotes evidence. This comment was paid for by the Pfizer company. Buying these drugs is foolish. Try sildenafil citrate. I get 20 milligram pills for $1.00 each. Guess what these are? That's right, generic viagra and they have been available for some time.  Viagra is actually a different name for the original drug. I forget the name of the original drug but it was meant to treat people with some sort of a heart problem. When men began to report that they had great erections the company had the FDA approve it under the name viagra for impotency. The original drug was eligible for a generic version a couple years ago and that happens to be sildenafil citrate. Talk to your pharmacist. Mine is the one that told me about them. The 20 mg sildenafil tablets aren't indicated by the FDA for erectile dysfunction, only for pulmonary hypertension. So, *technically* doctors aren't supposed to write for it that way, and pharmacies aren't supposed to dispense it that way. It totally happens, but Pfizer has done everything they possibly can to prevent it. You seem well informed. So sildenafil citrate is over the counter and essentially the same thing as Viagra? Is this what you'd recommend or is there some other varient e.g Kamagra that would be better.  It's not over the counter.  Still a prescription bed but yes same drug in smaller dose That explains why my doctor still writes the prescription for viagra. They change it at the pharmacy. Fun fact: the drug "pitocin" that is injected into a mother to be to induce labor was actually originally created to treat stomach ulcers but has the side effect to induce labor. We’ve had generic (or other name) “viagra” in Thailand for well over 10 years. The best one is called Kamagra and it comes in pill format or a gel pack that is fruit flavored. I think this comes from India. The cost is about $1.  I can’t believe people pay $65 for a brand name.  Our government likes to make sure drug companies are profitable. Drug companies pay bribes to our politicians to keep it going. I think they call it “lobbying.”  Shady as fuck, but legal. It certainly is shady as fuck. Legal does not always mean ethical and lobbyists sure do prove that. &gt; sildenafil citrate  100mg @ .72 per pill    http://www.samrx.com/buy-sildenafil-citrate.aspx Meh. Cialis is better.  You can get a combo of both in one capsule from some ahem...."research chemical" companies. The, uh, lab rats respond well. Where can you buy this? I'm, uh, asking for a friend. You can get liquid versions of tadalafil and sildenafil citrate without a prescription. One such place for US customers is called peptide pros, but there are others. I've bought both and I can confirm they do work similarly to the pill forms. The liquids have a rather unpleasant taste, but they work. &gt;	Not for human consumption  Gives one pause... &gt; &gt;	Not for human consumption  &gt; Gives one pause...  [Not really.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-label_use) Appreciated, but the companies selling these things are specifically stating that people shouldn’t ingest them. that’s not what “off-label” means. My friend buys it from Madison James Research. I heard. That's not generic, that's a low cost pill owned by the same company that stands to make a profit. The big question is why are they selling a low cost product after milking the brand name? Brand loyalty, simple as that. Pfizer understands that the market of 'brand-loyal' blue pill takers will absolutely jump ship as more competition hits, because that name recognition is only going to take you so far when the generic is a fraction of the price. Especially when it comes to something as important as being properly aroused when trying to have some sexy time, you're going to have people more likely to stay with what the know works - as long as they can justify it.  So instead of losing the lion's share of their drug's users to generic manufacturers, they'll lose less by being the "premier" generic. You could get free samples by the little brown bag full at the clinic,  and refills for $10 bucks a boner. Then the prices started to skyrocket and we learned how to cut these little blue footballs into thirds and quarters just to get some righteous wood. Greedy big pharma got all up in my junk's mojo @ $62 a pill.  I'm taking a generic version of Ravatio, which is the same stuff, just a different dosage. I'm taking it for my heart. Technically pulmonary hypertension Does viagra have any negative side effects? I feel like it would be interesting to try one.  Relevant bits from the Wikipedia article.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sildenafil  -----  **Recreational use**  Sildenafil's popularity with young adults has increased over the years. Sildenafil's trade name, Viagra, is widely recognized in popular culture, and the drug's association with treating erectile dysfunction has led to its recreational use. The reasons behind such use include the belief that the drug increases libido, improves sexual performance, or permanently increases penis size. Studies on the effects of viagra when used recreationally are limited, but suggest it has little effect when used by those not suffering from erectile dysfunction. In one study, a 25-mg dose was shown to cause no significant change in erectile quality, but did reduce the postejaculatory refractory time. This study also noted a significant placebo effect in the control group.  **Adverse Effects**   Headache, flushing, indigestion, nasal congestion, and impaired vision, including photophobia and blurred vision. Some sildenafil users have complained of seeing everything tinted blue (cyanopsia). Some complained of blurriness and loss of peripheral vision. In July 2005, the FDA found that sildenafil could lead to vision impairment in rare cases and a number of studies have linked sildenafil use with non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.  Rare but serious adverse effects found through postmarketing surveillance include prolonged erections, severe low blood pressure, myocardial infarction (heart attack), ventricular arrhythmias, stroke, increased intraocular pressure, and sudden hearing loss. In October 2007, the FDA announced that the labeling for all PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil, required a more prominent warning of the potential risk of sudden hearing loss. 4 Hour erection? "Call more ladies" So when are we finally going to get condoms laced with this stuff? What is the difference between brand and generic if the same company sells both? Are they actually making the generic different? No, probably no difference. I'm a pharmacist and it isn't uncommon to see a brand drug go generic and still be the exact same capsule/tablet that it was before. There are even some generic drugs out there that literally have the brand name printed on the pill. The pill shape needs to be re-evaluated.  clearly, they need to be shaped like little dicks   shaped like Pfizer executives? Pfizer: Little pill, Little results. I've been hearing radio ads for generic Viagra for a few weeks now.  This explains it. So when is Upjohn pharmaceuticals coming out with their version? [removed] [removed] Can they please call it the Boner pill? Named after Karl M. Boner the original chemist who designed it? Hasn't Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen been around forever?  

 When I saw the headline I assume he killed him with a punch. I can see how he could get manslaughter for that. But a stabbing which requires a weapon? Nah.   &gt; But a stabbing which requires a weapon?   The article doesn't really mention what he was stabbed with or how. He could have been stabbed with a pencil or a broadsword. Not really enough info in this article about what exactly went down to make any judgement.  http://www.cleveland.com/akron/index.ssf/2016/12/university_of_akron_student_di.html  &gt; Scheid is accused of grabbing a knife and stabbing Unternaher in the chest, police said. A third person in the apartment called 911 after the stabbing, saying Unternaher and Scheid were drunk at the time of the stabbing. Nice find!    Other little details not found in OP's article:  &gt; Sheid and the victim were out partying and drinking when they stopped to buy fast food to go and an argument ensued, Akron Police Lt. Rick Edwards told the Reflector earlier. &gt;  &gt; “The victim told the suspect not to touch his food. That of course happened after they came back to the apartment,” Edwards said.     One site said they got the food from Arbys.      Another included this :          &gt; “Not to get into the facts of the case too much, (but) I think it is important for the court to know that immediately after this accident happened Kendal had (another roommate) call 9-1-1. When paramedics and police arrived, Kendal was in the bathroom administering first aid to Duncan, trying to keep him safe and keep him alive,” Malarcik told the judge.     &gt;     &gt; "He cooperated fully with law enforcement and told them everything that had happened here,” the defense attorney added.     &gt; &gt; Devin Rogala, Scheid and the victim’s roommate, called 9-1-1 at 12:34 a.m. Saturday. Rogala, after asking Scheid, told the dispatcher that Unternaher was stabbed “in the chest area” and was breathing, but “completely unconscious.”     &gt; &gt; “I need an ambulance, as soon as possible please. … My roommate stabbed my other roommate,” Rogala said during the 9-1-1 call. “They are in the bathroom. He (Scheid) is keeping pressure on the wound trying to keep him elevated.”    &gt; &gt; Rogala added that both of his roommates were “highly  intoxicated.”     &gt; “They had been (roommates) since their freshman year,” the police spokesman added. “They were all fraternity brothers.” &gt; Schied and Unternaher were members of Phi Delta Theta.  He originally plead not guilty to murder and felonious assault but then plead guilty under an agreement with prosecutors for the lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter   What I still haven't seen is an explanation for what makes this an 'accident' as opposed to a drunken mistake.  Right? If you get too drunk and make the mistake of driving and accidently kill someone, I don't think you'd get away with the "oh, well it was just an accident" excuse. could be the proximity of the knife.   if they were arguing in the kitchen next to the knives its less egregious than if they were arguing in another room and he left to go get a weapon and come back and use it.   one is an impulse the other is a decision  I still call that impulse decision a form of murder.. not involuntary manslaughter.  There was really nothing involuntary about it, from what I've read. you can call it whatever you want it doesn't show premeditation so its not treated like murder in our justice system.    Ahem - Second-degree murder: any intentional murder with malice aforethought, but is not premeditated or planned.  Yeah, that's murder, bud.  He got a knife.. and stabbed him.  That's intentional and not up for debate.  Not being premeditated is what makes it 2nd degree.  Still murder.  Here's a link about it: http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/second-degree-murder-overview.html  Involuntary manslaughter is more like when you are speeding and accidentally kill someone.  Yeah, you didn't mean to, but it happened directly because of your actions, so it was involuntarily killing them.. hence, manslaughter.  *Edit* - you said "our" justice system and I realized you might not be American.  What I said here applies to the American justice system.  I don't know about others. He used a weapon in a fight and someone died and he's getting off light. I don't understand your logic what does it matter what he stabbed him with?  The article says it was an accident. If two drunk guys were arguing and one of them happened to be holding a pen while being tackled to the ground resulting in someone getting stabbed it would matter. If one of them swung his hands up in frustration while holding a fork and didn't realize his friend had come up behind him resulting in him getting stabbed it would matter.     We could spend all day inventing wild stories where one friend accidentally stabs another with various objects in various circumstances. The fact is we simply don't have the information to stay what happened.  &gt; The article says it was an accident.   That's misleading. *The defense lawyer for the accused* said it was an accident. There's a big difference between, say, shoving someone and having them hit their head on the way down and die and, say, stabbing someone in the throat with a pair of scissors. Not all "accidents" are equal in terms of culpability. Very true and in this case we don't have the information to determine what kind of accident this was. We do know this guy was charged with involuntary manslaughter and not murder and that he got a pretty light sentence. In absence of further details I'm going to assume that could very well be reasonable for the circumstances and reserve my outrage for the moment.  I agree with you to the point that nobody knows anything more than what happened in the article, the article doesn't really even quote or cite anything for "stabbing". I wish I could see the evidence testimony.  3 years for murder, 5 years for illegal fire sharing http://www.webster.edu/technology/service-desk/illegal-downloading.html   And 15 years for leaving bacon in a mosque. Actually, 6 years maximum, and she also smashed 6 windows, and slashed bike seats and tires at the mosque That never happened in America. There was a girl who is being tried here in Davis, CA for leaving bacon strips and breaking windows at the mosque on the UC Davis campus. well that sounds like vandalism and destruction of property so why wouldn't they be tried? Its also a hate crime Well, whatever she gets charged with won't be for the bacon, it will be for the broken windows. That's arson.  How is breaking windows arson? It's actually grand theft auto I goofed and wasthink of vandalism. Arson is vandalism with fire, this isn't arson.  The bacon made it a hate crime as well releasing a bunch of puppies in a mosque would be much more fun you can't really count their laws as real laws. They let their rapists off the hook if they marry the victim. No one who wants to follow their laws is really compatible with the 20th century, let alone the 21st.  It wasn't murder..... [deleted] &gt;Shit man, I know I've had a few beers but damn, my reading comprehension must fly out the window or something  No, I think the problem is you don't know the definition for murder. What you just described is manslaughter. [deleted] Why the hell do people get so angry at such stupid shit? Drunk teens and early twenties, shit can be dangerous.  His roommate got a life sentence (*death*) ... this fucking asshole only gets 3 years.  Literally shaking my head as I type. Not exactly three years. He will be eligible for release in ***six months***.  6 Months! That's a Hockey Season. No shit. I'd be so pissed if I missed the entire season for murdering someone. At least let me out for playoffs. Do the right thing. You know they don't get NBC sports in the house. Now that is a good attorney.  6 months if good behavior for homicide.  Or a shitty prosecutor.  If you have a good attorney, he or she may be able to influence who the assigned assistant or DA is or how you are brought to trial.   Or a broken system. There must be additional details to the case that aren't in the article.  *person of colour sips tea* That's 20 years for you Sentencing to life (or killing him) over a drunk fight seems unreasonable as well. He doesn't seem like he was out to kill, he was just drunk and stupid. Putting those people in jails permanently just seems wasteful, and comes across as just vengeful rather then for corrective action. Do we want people who stab others over fast food in society? An asshole that randomly goes off over nothing and kills someone is scarier to me then an plotting murderer. I don't want to be in a bar or whatever when this dumbfuck gets tilted over nothing.   This shows an extreme lack of control and judgement in this individual, why should society continue to be threatened with the random violence because this dude can't control himself?  It's not like this was victimless juvenile mischief kids grow out of, he stabbed his friend to death..  Yeah, I agree.  This isn't one of those things that we all did when we were teenagers.  This is an unacceptable mistake that should carry an appropriate punishment.  You get about this much time for robbery or something, and that doesn't make sense.  Maybe it should not be 20 years, but a chance to go free in 0.5 years if he's a good boy?  That's too low.   $20 says this dude winds up killing another person. I'll take that action.  I had a big diatribe prepared. Something about decent people don’t consider violence even when intoxicated blah blah blah.   I’ll spare you that and distill it down to one nugget of wisdom from a friend of mine:  “If you’re an asshole drunk you’re an asshole sober “ It's involuntary manslaughter, unless you have access to the court documents  I'm not going to say he went off on a whim. How exactly is a harsher prison sentence going to prevent this next time? Do you think that this guy was actually aware that he was capable of killing or even stabbing another human over fast food? He probably had severe unresolved anger issues that he wasn't aware of or had no idea how to treat, and alcohol provided the catalyst. What if this is literally the first time those feelings surfaced, thanks to being more drunk than he's ever been before?  Ultimately, he is responsible for his own actions, but some people are redeemable, and I think that we should appropriately evaluate that and act appropriately. It's better to allow someone to return to being a productive member of society if it's clear that the incident truly changed them. I was willing to believe he was just an angry guy until I heard it was stabbing. If it was a fist fight gone too far that’s one thing, but trying to stab someone is downright ridiculous, guy needs 5 years or more of quality rehabilitation, its not just a drunk mishap, he’s not fit for society. If he's in jail he's not stabbing people over fast food.  Part of criminal justice is removing those who can't function correctly in society so that their ability to harm others is reduced.  For many people, getting caught leads to "corrective action."  Very little evidence on how long they have to be imprisoned for this to take effect.  I agree he ought not to be in jail for life, but the sentence does seem relatively light. Eh, guy who went to my high school got in an argument and brawled with a guy with a pistol in his hand, killing the other when it went off.  Manslaughter - 3 years.   Keep in mind though he's now a violent felon and the decently well paying career he had is gone forever, when he gets out he'll probably be living at home with his mom at 30 and be lucky if he can get a job making more than poverty levels of income.   I don't think a lot of people actually know what normal sentencing is for crimes, massive sentences of 7+ years are not common even for violent crime. And the punishment isn't just time, it's also lack of options getting out  When people raise uproar that US prison population is too high a big factor outside of drug crimes is the fact that so many people balk when they hear sentencing and constantly demand they must be longer and longer. We have really inflated sentencing here relative to most developed Western nations because of that. I'm ok with reducing the prison population by reducing time for non violent drug crimes etc.   But violent criminals? You're really ok with someone who gets drunk and violent and KILLS SOMEBODY being released after 3 years?  How can you possibly be ok with that?  Wait. I'm confused. Some guy had a gun, your friend wrestled with him, and the gun went off, killing the guy brandishing a weapon and your friend got in trouble for that? If that was correct, how the heck did that happen? Seems like self defense and an accident.  I wouldn't call us friends, just a guy who went to my high school.  He(guy convicted) was the one with the gun.   He grabbed it out of his truck and tried to pistol whip him when it went off. Oh. I read that wrong. That was a dumb thing to do. So he meant to beat the shit out of the guy with his pistol and ended up shooting him to death? You're high school acquaintance got off extraordinarily easy. Even if it was accidental, that he went to his truck to retrieve the weapon, means that it was more than an oopsie moment.  He was driving away when the guy leapt into the bed of the truck and started beating on it trying to break the back windshield. He didn't fish it out and bring it back to a fight, he was trying to leave from the argument when the guy followed him and he grabbed it stepping out of his truck in an effort to get him off his truck.   You guys keep making assumptions, the best assumption when you hear a manslaughter charge is assuming there were a considerable amount of complicating circumstances muddying up arguments for intent and reasonable defense. People spent weeks deliberating over the facts of the case, who are we to say they're wrong based on snippets? Because a gun is best used as a club. Yeah I pull out my stabbin knife whenever I get drunk too, glad he’s going to be free soon I’m sure his temper won’t ever be an issue to anyone else again. That fact that this asshole was drunk doesn't make him any less dead. Good thing drunk is an excuse for violence, right? I didn't rape her officer, I was drunk. Oh, then you're free to go.  &gt; He doesn't seem like he was out to kill, he was just drunk and stupid.   I would have agreed if this was a fist fight, but he picked up a knife.    Do the crime do the time.  Lets pretend he killed your daughter. Im sure you would be cool with 3 years Doubt it, on the flip side of he was my son this would be nice.    There's a middle ground between 3 years and life I don't disagree. It wasn't 1st degree murder, with malice and intent, but he's eligible for release in 6 months. I mean. He should have to be punished a bit more. Like no release before 3 years at all. And even that is pretty light. He says he was just drunk and stupid.  It seems very reasonable to me to remove a murderer from society.  Our prison system has nothing to do with corrective action.  If it did you would see a massive transfer of wealth from working people to criminals.  There isn't enough money in the world to correct adult career criminals. So to be clear you’re saying having a harsh penalty for murdering someone seems wasteful?  you can see the white crazy in his eyes, release him and it will happen again i guarantee. I hate the "He was just drunk and stupid" argument. It's ridiculous. People need to own up to their actions and take responsibilities for their mistakes and crimes, whether or not they were sober. If you can't control yourself when drunk, then you shouldn't drink alcohol.  He had Someone call 911 and seems to have taken a guilty plea, I'm not sure how that isn't owning up to it.  He did get one of his room mates to call 911 to get help so he must have admitted to it as well. It's obviously not pre meditated. He may well have shown remorse.  It's not a great situation but you'd need all the details to be sure as to whether the sentencing is appropriate. no wonder he called 911 he just fuckin killed somebody   would you give someone 6 months possibility of parole if they gave a rape victim a towel after?  Will remorse bring his victim back to life?   Will serving a life sentence do it? Nope but the rest of humanity is now safe from a person who thinks it is a funny drunk joke to stab people. Or maybe someone who made a huge mistake that he's unlikely to repeat spends the rest of his life in prison and no one wins.  Where did you get the idea that it was a funny drunk joke?  The fact is that without the details you don't know. Stabbing someone isn't a mistake. Forgetting your keys is a mistake not getting an oil change is a mistake.   A huge mistake that he was sentenced to three years in prison for.  It's a bit disingenuous to compare it to losing your keys.  What do you think would be a fair sentence? This stabber is extremely lucky. This was a very lenient sentence! have to make room for all the "evil" drug users that need nearly a life sentence to keep them from making themselves feel good  I am sure someone who kills another over food will never be a danger to society /s 3 years more than Kate Steinle's killer got, so I'd still count it as a win. That was an actual accident, though.  Only 3 years?? wtf? Pussy pass? If my roommate looked like that, I'd wonder if I was going to get stabbed. is it because he's a ginge? I mean, yeah. They don't have souls.   It's also a little bit the haircut and beard. I mean yeah? It must suck to not be a ginger and still feel threatened by them  Found the insecure ginger. But really, no one is threatened by them, everyone is just making jokes.  Also a joke no one wants to fight a person with no sole &gt;no sole  Well, maybe they should get some new shoes?  Did he also get a 4.0 for the semester because his roommate died?   It would be cool if sentences for crimes like this included a penalty of never being allowed to drink alcohol again.   For dui's many times probation requires that you not drink and be willing to submit to tests.  Right.  The reality is that not everyone is able to use it responsibly.   TIL that to get away with murder, you just have to be drunk when you do it.   Ridiculous.  And it has to involve fast food.  Or chips. &gt; murder  Involuntary manslaughter.    And he didn't get away with it. 6 months minimum 3 years maximum. He got away with it  It wasn't pre-meditated.  That's a key component.  You can't "get away with something" you didn't plan on doing. The way you have that worded almost sounds like you're OK with crimes of opportunity. I doubt that that's what you mean, however.  I bet no one *plans* on getting so drunk that they drive the wrong way down the highway &amp; turn some unwitting vehicle into a burning heap, either. And whenever that happens *everybody* lines up to, rightfully, crucify the asshole who did it. Reddit is especially on-board with sending drunk drivers to prison for extended sentences.  So what's the difference in your mind between drunk stabbing &amp; drunk driving? You could say that someone who gets into a vehicle when drunk is *knowingly* placing someone else's life in peril. But isn't stabbing someone *also* knowingly placing their life in peril? Why else would you stab them? Not to mention, lots of people drive drunk without causing death—making drunk driving, in a certain sense, more reasonable than drunk stabbing.  In my mind, he planned on stabbing his roommate the second he picked up the knife. He didn't plan it for very long, obviously. But he didn't 'accidentally' stab his friend to death.   He stabbed the guy to death.  3 years is getting away with it. And white. This coming from a white dude.  Worked for Kate Steinle's killer, oh wait... Nah this guy got charged with *something.*  Best thing to do is run the over with your car, then, claim you didn’t see them/they swerved in front of you (particularly helpful if your target is on a bike). You’ll probably just get a ticket.  Or be an illegal alien living in a sanctuary city.  No wait, the guy in this story actually got punished while the illegal literally got away with murder. Shit posts in /r/the_donald and /r/conspiracy. How shocking. This country puts people away for life for having a few ounces of crack on them, and this fucking guy who *murdered* someone gets 3 years? Wtf is wrong with this country? There was a thread posted asking reddit what was the quickest way you know that someone fucked up their life.  Well... here you go. Tbh it’s just gonna be 3 years of his life.  But it's gonna follow him to the grave... a classic mcds vs tacobell deathfight. winner gets to choose where to eat dinner.  That article was so sparse on details that I’m surprised that a lot of people ITT are upset or angry that the judge (who had more access to information than any of us) sentenced him to 3 years.  [removed] &gt; the parameters of the argument.  its only a matter of time before society's collective rage at McD's inability to get the bun, filet, tartar &amp; cheese centered on the same vertical axis triggers widespread unrest and a Constitutional crisis.   Excuse you, but In-N-Out is greater than all. And I’m a fan of Bojangles and Raising Cane. Shit is **so** good.  Them's stabbin' words, friendo... I felt dirty going to Popeyes, but sometimes you get desperate and need the fix....since there wasn’t a Bojangles remotely close.  Bojangles just has that extra edge on pretty much all of the staples of my ideal fried chicken meal.  Even if I got past the shitty Popeyes biscuit and their sub par version of seasoned fries. If we were just comparing chicken, Bojangles clearly wins.  And cheerwine versus cherry coke? Not even close.   Going off on a tangent here, but Bojangle's bacon, egg, and cheese biscuits are full of stars. Goddamn, them shits is delicious. A man was just sentenced to 15 years for breaking windows and lights at a house of worship.  He also left bacon on the property.  Is this justice?  A man is dead and his murderer gets three years while a hateful man destroys property and gets 15 (with another 15 on probation)?  Our justice system is broken.  Our penalty system is broken.   There are almost no facts in this article.   There may have been some realllllly bad facts that the prosecutor didn’t want to take to trial, and thus they were forced to make this deal.  ITT: Outrage culture mixed with ignorance. There are countless academic papers and studies on the sentencing disparity in the US. The statistical findings date back to the 20's...I'm not sure outrage culture is unwarranted if this issue is quickly closing on 100 years.... Just another lesson that only you can protect yourself, because the justice system sure won't if something happens to you.  Involentary manslaughter, had someone call 911 and tried to save him... IDK what you can do.  You can try not stabbing people.  That's a pretty good option. It's so crazy it just might work.  Idk, not stabbing people is pretty easy. I've managed to do it my entire life. I've only stabbed one person. Is that close enough? Did it turn out that the person was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the protozoic era? Fossil records don't lie.  u/KnowBrainer is a time traveler confirmed. Nope :(   Just some punk who thought he could get away with stealing and left instead with a nasty scar. *Involuntarily* stabbing someone during a fight strains credulity.  Heh that's my local news channel, neat. Yeah, but why are we reading about a story in Ohio from an affiliate in Norfolk? They report on all stories of interest, even if not local. But coincidentally, we do get overrun with a tin of tourists with Ohio plates every summer. killed someone over fast food...get three years...murder...and only three years. Must be a white kid. (goes to view story....3...2...1.... YEP)  Of course Ohio, so glad I got out of that shit hole.  I visited Columbus early this year, had a great time. It was nice, friendly people.  SHHH! Ohio is a shit hole. Just listen to all the smug reddit hipsters who love to make edgy comments and broad, sweeping generalizations.  I mean, you have anecdotal evidence of a visit, and I have anecdotal evidence of living there 20 years and an article about a dude killing his friend over fastfood so... *shrugs*  I'm with ya. Fuck that place with a pinecone, or maybe buckeye anal beads. Let me guess......his parents are rich. So Ill make a fucking prophecy before I click the link.  **"This guy must so white. Hipster kinda white, teen influenza kind of white"**  And... click  Edit: Yup, white boy.  Edit: Gone in 6 months. Well, another good one for USA. yeah that's not long enough. Reminds me of something that happened at my university. Two friends were arguing over a video game. They used plastic cutlery and paper plates all the time. The one friend jokingly picked up a plastic knife and threated his friend in the kitchen. The other friend leaned toward him trying to tower over him. The arm holding the knife was jarred against the counter. The knife entered in-between his ribs and peirced his lung. He lived but the family still wanted to press charges since it "couldn't have been an accident since he stabbed him." Is no one else interested in what they could have possibly been fighting about over fast food that could’ve escalated to this?.  Did someone eat the other guys fry? Did they argue over the correct spelling of Filet? Did someone say “pass the meat craft” and the other refused?  I seriously can’t find any other info than it was “about fast food”. I hate that people treat being drunk like it's an excuse .....  Rules for getting the justice system on your side  1.  Be white.  2.  Don't be unwhite.   To be honest tho what kind of life do you have after even the max 3 years where you have to disclose to every job opportunity that you spent time in prison for murder?  Essentially no information on this horrible source.   I know! How can I make a decision on whether this was a fair sentencing, without knowing what kind of fast food it was? Was it McDonalds? Hang him! Five Guys or In-n-Out? Probation. These things must be considered. Fucking 3 years is the max he will spend in prison. He could get out in 6 months. You know he must be rich and white  Yeah that makes sense seeing as how an illegal immigrant just got off the hook for murder completely. Fuck off.  3 years? even for manslaughter, that is quite low White people have a different set of rules. This is bs. It should be 30 years, not 3.  I don't get why people are upset at this sentence. In the rest of the civilized world, this sentence is not out of place for the crime committed. if i kill your mom and claimed to be drunk would you be okay if i went to jail for 6 months and got released for good behavior? maybe i'll swing by your house after and bake you a "sorry i killed your family" pie I'd argue getting off easy with stabbing someone to death isn't very civilized.  I would argue that you don't know the meaning of civilised. If America is more socially developed than other countries then why do they have such a high crime rate and reoffending rate in comparison? The American justice system usually focuses on punishment rather than rehabilitation. This may be good in theory, but compared to countries that focus on rehabilitation, it has a negative effect on society as a whole. If I was assaulted, I would rather the perpetrator be reintegrated as a productive member of society once they have shown remorse and an understanding of what it means to be part of a civilised society rather than rot away in jail and resenting a society that has left them behind.   I'm not arguing the american system is better. I however don't really believe most other countries, even european countries, would give a minimum sentence of 6 months in prison to someone who got a knife to plunge into their roommate's chest. Drunk or not, that's not someone who should be let off lightly. Doesn't sound civilized to me, unless you think they can rehabilitate in that short amount of time for such a crime. Spoilers, they won't.  That'll learn 'em. Just don't break into and leave bacon at mosques, that'll get you five times that sentence. Leave bacon *and smash windows, lights, and various other things.* That clarification, while important, still leaves us in a situation where property damage is worse than violently ending someone else's life. Hard to get on board with that.  Except it's not just property damage, it's property damage with the intent to intimidate a protected class. Intent matters. Yeah because the petty vandalism totally justified a sentence of over 10 years, meanwhile a murderer gets less than 3. This is what being soft on crime looks like. America - hard on crime. Most violent country in OECD.  Every other OECD country - soft on crime. Lower crime rates than the US.
 Fun fact. The Bionic Woman Jamie Summers lived in Ojai.  Seems like they could use her help Elvira too. Fire is 100,000 acres and still spreading. My family has been out of our home since early Tuesday. It seems our neighborhood escaped the worst, but that was before last night's gusts. I have co-workers from Ojai and Casitas Vista whose homes are in the danger zone. One of my son's friends lost his home. I think it is a shame that this isn't farther up on /r/news
 I wonder what theyre going to do with ten tons of cocaine. I mean what is the street value of 8 tons of cocaine anyway? You wonder what their going to do with it? The United States Government has been the "worlds largest drug distributor" for the past 150 years. They have the perfect scam, declare war on a substance, put it on the street so people have access to it, arrest a good number of said people take everything they own and everything they'll ever own, and in the process confiscate what's left of the substance for redistribution on the street, rinse and repeat. The east coast is about to be flooded with a fresh batch of high quality snow.       I hope its cheap. capturing the narcotics from several vessels in the eastern part of the Pacific Ocean   &lt;------???  why bring it all the way to florida? Florida is an excellent distribution hub for the 6 tons of cocaine Ahhh I see what you did there.... USCGC Escanaba is home ported in Boston, MA. So the drugs were dropped off in FL on it's way back to MA.    Canada helping US Coastguard in Florida.    Anyone else scratching their heads on this one.  
 &gt;John Sipher, who spent 28 years in the CIA’s National Clandestine Service, argued that while direct targeting of US diplomats is rare, unintended harm caused by surveillance efforts that go wrong are much more common.  &gt;“These efforts, while designed to further surveillance and eavesdropping and not to cause malicious damage, nevertheless risked or resulted in residual physical harm to US diplomats,” Sipher said in a commentary on the Just Security website.  I am curious as to what specific type of equipment is used for this. This makes more sense to me then Cuba deliberately trying to cause harm. They wouldn’t have much to gain a lot to lose if they intended to harm the diplomats.  There are plenty of factions, Cuban included, that would gain from a further breakdown in US-Cuban relations.  Russia, for instance, is Cuba's #1 creditor and maintains close relations with the island nation. they don't have to do much. The big cheese has already made it clear that he wants to be the antithesis of Obama. That includes souring relations with Cuba Cuba stands to gain a lot more from improved relations with the US than the US would gain from them with Cuba. The US would get another cheap vacation destination, Cuba would get rapid modernization and billions of dollars worth of outside investment.  Ya which is why they were working with the Obama administration to improve relations. [Trump threw alot of that out of the window](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/white-house-implements-new-cuba-policy-restricting-travel-and-trade/2017/11/08/a5597dee-c49b-11e7-aae0-cb18a8c29c65_story.html) https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uzbekistan-incident-raises-suspicions-of-russian-involvement-in-cuba-attacks/  Methinks it's not Cuba.  So you're saying that Cuba and Donald Trump have some things in common. Someone has insidious technology that can cause permanent damage without those being harmed even knowing. IMO, that's the scary part of the story, never mind bump stocks and high capacity magazines, this is way worse. &gt; without those being harmed even knowing  Pretty sure they know now According to the story, they didn't know until they had symptoms, the device operated outside of human hearing ranges. Might be able to shed some light. My dad is an acoustic consultant, and he has a masters in acoustic engineering. When I asked him about this incident and what could be causing it, he postulated that the Cubans likely had some sort of surveillance equipment that was broadcasting at a frequency that is harmful to humans, but is also outside the audible range (20 - 20k Hz). High decibel sounds within the audible range can be damaging, so I imagine it would be essentially like exposing yourself to a motorcycle engine *all fucking day* except you cant even hear it. But that does not cause changes to brain white matter.  I am an electrical engineer, and I am quite skeptical of the claims that this was done with pressure waves of any sort.  Besides the fact that we already know that such waves do not cause that kind of brain damage, the physics of that claim don't pass muster either.  Moving that much air will always produce effects in the environment that you will notice, and requires huge drivers to do.  It definitely would not be a portable device.  &gt;Moving that much air will always produce effects in the environment that you will notice, and requires huge drivers to do  Can you clarify this? Obviously something like a wifi router isn't putting out a ton of sound pressure but its presence is entirely unobservable as a sensory experience as far as I'm aware. What sort of environmental impact would you expect to see from something blasting 100 dB at something in the MHz-GHz range? That’s insane to think about. Thanks for asking your dad, he sounds like a good person to have around during a crisis like this. Does he have any thoughts on what could possibly cause the destruction of white brain matter? This whole thing is a fascinating yet terrifying juncture of world politics, engineering,’medicine and spy tech. Radiation of some type. Possibly just plain old X-ray.  I thought it was a sonic weapon You might hear something when your ear nerves get microwaved. No. People (including State Dept spokespeople) speculated this, but it never added up.  Diplomats definitely reported hearing weird noises, but you're not damaging the brain or causing the described symptoms with airborne sound waves [unless you directly couple the sound generator to your head, or it's so loud that the building is shaking].  There are, however, some scenarios that can cause you to hear sound from *electromagnetic* waves: you'll have heard stories of people in the old days hearing radio stations through their head, w which was no exaggeration - EM signals can be picked up with things like metallic tooth-fillings, which then vibrate and resonate through the skull.  It's not beyond the realms of possibility something similar happened here. Strong signals like that would be picked up as interference on microphones too, and would sound pretty similar to the audio samples they presented.  Strong microwaves also are known to cause brain damage. My god, there is another sane person in this world.  This story about "ultrasound weapons" has me feeling like I am on crazy pills, because it is such pseudoscience nonsense.  The whole story almost feels like a counter-intel psyop to begin with.  I swear the stories that the CIA makes up got a lot more idiotic after Tom Clancy died.   I think what happened with the ultrasound-weapon theory was a case of "a little knowledge is a dangerous thing". My pet theory, is that someone unqualified in the embassy went on wikipedia, and saw mentions of studies that ultrasound has been found to cause brain-damage in mice.   What they didn't appreciate was the context of that study: that it wasn't airborne ultrasound (it involved coupling the mice's head to the ultrasound scanner directly or through water).   But this became folk knowledge amongst the staffers, then it leaked, and of course the media ran with it...   It's always sounded like wiser heads in the State Dept have been trying to rein in that speculation ever since, without embarrassing their embassy staff. There is nothing about the symptoms described consistent with radiation poisoning. We are familiar with radiation poisoning. This is different.  Radiation poisoning is from ionizing radiation (x-ray and above), lower frequency RF causes other issues. Yeah, and I was responding to the suggestion that this was from X-rays.  That doesn't jive with what I know about em radiation. Wouldn't the eyes have gone blind as well 'Scuse me, I speak jive: http://americanenglishdoctor.com/wordpress/jive-and-jibe/ I bet you were chomping at the bit to say that before you even stepped foot in the room. https://www.bathroomreader.com/2014/04/chomping-vs-champing/ https://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2014/05/step-foot.html  From what I've heard minor tumors from radiation from directed microwave listening devices. The Soviets dumped so much microwave radiation in to our embassy in the attempts to listen in that an old joke was that you'd be glowing after 6 months there. Allegedly of course. Microwaves are non ionizing. They lack the energy to damage DNA, and if you get hit with enough to cause harm, the boiling water in your skin would let you know &gt; Microwaves are non ionizing  Really?  Tell that to [this plasma](https://science.wonderhowto.com/how-to/make-ball-plasma-microwave-194331/) RADAR and TV antenna techs have maximum permissible levels of exposure for a reason.  While there hasn't been a strong link between L-band RF and cancer the studies typically don't look at exposure levels as high as implied here. Yes, but those antennae are measured in the tens of kilowatts of power output.  My interpretation of the above theory was that surveillance equipment was broadcasting up in the kW range (60 dBm+). Sounds like a lot of power but if you want to broadcast omnidirectionaly, able to punch through walls, and be able to pick it up at a decent range (with tech of that era) you would probably need to a fair bit. That much? That's more than I expected.  It is also based on the assumption that the carrier frequency is high enough to be out of range of common RF devices. 10+ GHz tends to have poor range, especially through structures, so if you are a few blocks away trying to pick it up with a whole string of houses in the way...   Would love some to run some numbers and come up with a better guess though. This is a very old story about how the Soviets used something akin to very early RFID to power bugs by blasting them with huge amounts of RF.  Which again, never caused any symptoms like in this story.  &gt; RADAR and TV antenna techs have maximum permissible levels of exposure for a reason  It's so they don't microwave themselves to death in a melty ball of human flesh-soup.  These exposure limits are maximum intensity limits, not cumulative energy limits.  Unlike with ionizing radiation, there is no time limit for exposure as long as you are under the intensity threshold to begin with.  Mmmm that's almost right but there are certainly time limits for exposure for HF, VHF, and UHF EM radiation at different wattages / frequencies. The safe exposure limits are WAY less than the levels that would cause even perceptible heating, net alone being melted. There is a lot more to the spectrum than the 1-22 GHz that is readily absorbed by water.  Have a look at [rfcafe](http://www.rfcafe.com/references/electrical/fcc-maximum-permissible-exposure.htm) for some good info with sources.    &gt; hile direct targeting of US diplomats is rare, unintended harm caused by surveillance efforts that go wrong are much more common.  good to know. so that killed my diplomat dreams Stack a couple dozen Marshall DSL100s on a truck, point and sound Maybe a very powerful and focused electromagnetic attack?   A directed EMP, so to speak. Boom goes the EMP cannon? Directional microwave canon. It's a radio transmitter that also accidentally acted as a microwave. It explains all symptoms including the sounds. I'll find a link to a paper that shows you hallucinate sound when your head is exposed to certain RF bands.   Here: http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/scc28/sc4/Auditory%20effects.pdf well it has to be some kind of microphone that targets a specific area but must transmit some kind of waves that are dangerous ? I have no idea. It's very strange There was a similar incident to this when we were building an embassy in the USSR. Though they were shooting microwaves at diplomats which gave some of them brain tumors. This is much more sophisticated weapon though a similar type of attack. I know this isn't /r/science, but microwave radiation is non-ionizing and there is no evidence that it causes cancer or tumors:  https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1018449003394  non-ionizing radiation by definition does not have the energy required to destroy DNA (and thus cause cancer) the way gamma rays, etc can. Focused microwaves can still cause localized heating which over time could be disruptive to cellular processes.  Not saying that's what happened, but it could be an angle of investigation. Interesting enough the naval yard shooter was complaint about that very thing days before he shot up the place. The guy who shot up the movie theatre had a similar tumor issue I believe. The naval yard guy didn't have a tumor. He said he was hearing voices and felt like microwaves were heating him up.  The ft Lauderdale shooter said something animal about voices. They both went to authorities before.  Interesting. What about in a frequency range of 2.5 to 4 GHz? Edit: Microwaves I guess are pretty low frequencies vs gamma rays which is a very high frequency.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3509929/  Edit: This did happen, but "The conclusions were that no adverse health effects of the radiation were shown." &gt;the authors state “however, **it was not possible to find any satisfactory explanation for this, due mainly to the small numbers of deaths involved and the absence of information on many epidemiological characteristics that influence the occurrence of many types of malignant neoplasms.”** (page 243).  the study itself links it to longer time spent in Moscow, which might have been due other things, such as increased drinking, worse healthcare, stress, etc. The article itself states that there are literally hundreds of different factors that are involved and the small number of deaths are not statistically significant.  All the rest of the peer-reviewed journals also don't mention any significant risk from microwaves.  Finally, if the 2.5 to 4 ghz range is really problematic, then we're very screwed as most of the wireless devices we use emit RF frequencies ranging from 2.4 to 5 ghz.  That's all microwaves are. It's radio frequencies operating at a specific frequency.  Microwaves in that range are able to heat cells due to moving molecules around, but it's not capable of moving electrons around and being in a warm room as the same effect. They can cause severe burns which could potentially cause skin cancer. Even then that is extremely rare. Cancer development due to scar tissue of a burn has many other factors involved and isn't so much just because the tissue is damaged. Learned this from our plants microwave radio guy awhile back. The microwave I am referring to is point to point radio systems we use with our SCADA. This right here guys, is why you never place your router on your microwave.   It will kill your wireless when you turn it on.  Stick your head in a microwave.  Turn it on.  A microwave will cause tissue heating and potential damage if it's strong enough  Edit:  Microwaves are around 2450 MHz which makes water molecules vibrate and heat up.  Heating your soft tissues like this is a terribad idea &gt;Stick your head in a microwave.  Not falling for that one again. I mean you would be falling down if you did. Instructions unclear. Microwave auditory effect.  It's where you hear a voice inside your head. This is one of the most interesting stories so far this year. The technology to do this must be pretty damn impressive. If, as speculated, it's a microwave emitter, it's not actually much more complex than your Wi-Fi router. Actually it could be less complex since it doesn't transmit information. Wouldn't a microwave emitter cause blindness first and foremost ? ... do you mean blindness?  [deleted] ... you mean blindness right? yes xD (Phone with German autocorrect, dunno what blindmost is supposed to mean though) This is why I never leave my house without an aluminum foil lined hat.

Not the *entertainment* section. It was essentially a covert act of war.  There's been a covert war with Russia since 1945.   There was a break in the 90s when it looked like we might start getting along. Yeah, right up until we interfered in the 1996 Russian election and got Boris Yeltsin, that corrupt drunk, re-elected.  [Here's Time Magazine bragging about it.](https://i.redd.it/isllgiy7ch9z.jpg)  &gt; The outcome was by no means inevitable. Last winter Yeltsin's approval ratings were in the single digits. There are many reasons for his change in fortune, but a crucial one has remained a secret. For four months, a group of American political consultants clandestinely participated in guiding Yeltsin's campaign.  &gt;Braynin began a series of confidential discussions with Yeltsin's aides, including one with First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, who at the time was in charge of the President's nascent re-election effort. Finally, in early February, Braynin was instructed to "find some Americans" but to proceed discreetly. "Secrecy was paramount," says Braynin. "Everyone realized that if the Communists knew about this before the election, they would attack Yeltsin as an American tool. We badly needed the team, but having them was a big risk."  &gt;For two days the supersecretive Yeltsin high command avoided Dresner, and none of the team ever actually met the President. "There are too many factions and too many leaks to risk your dealing with him directly," Braynin explained to Dresner. "You are our biggest secret."  wait, i don't understand.  did the US actually interfere with the election or did they just send some election advisors?  i feel like interference implies something a bit more underhanded and nefarious.   That was an act.  Russia has been actively lulling the west into a sense of complacency since the 90's. What are you talking about? There were legitimate attempts by Yeltsin to strengthen the bond between Russia and the West. That's a very western perspective.  Yeltsin needed money from the west, and played along with NATO expansion etc.  But the rest of Russia was never really on board.  Totally agree.  Russia was in chaos in the 90s.  Yelsin knew what he was doing when he selected putin Before that even, Soviet spies were in the US way before ww2.  Since the red revolution in 1917. What? It's been made pretty clear that there is nothing to support that. By whom though? It's not in Cuba's apparent interest to do such a thing.  Know who DOES want the US out of Cuba? Trump and the American far right.  Not sayin, just sayin.  EDIT: AAAAAND the thread is being brigaded by the deplorables. And who else...Russia Same thing. It could be in the interests of a rogue faction of Cuban intelligence which feels that improved US-Cuban relations would loss them power and money.             Exactly.   Communist dictatorships aren’t exactly known for rational thought.  Cuba is a communist dictatorship. Apparent interest and actual interest don’t always coinside.   With that being said, I don’t know if they’re actualky responsible but I’d certainly wager that they know who is.   And yea, that’s a cool theory you have there. 100% not rooted in fact but interesting anyway.  Placing my bets!!!  $5 on [Ciguatera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciguatera)  Damn, most of the side effects from this toxin seem to fall in line with the reported ailments. I think you might be right. It seems weird that Cuba would do this. What benefit would there be?  Seems more likely it’s a third party. This. I'm guessing the Russians. . .this fits their M.O. and they have the motive. I honestly think the only thing Cuba is guilty of would be shit security. The Russians may have had some knowledge from old allegiance or possibly parties still loyal to Russian motives that enabled them to pull it off.  100% conjecture. More than willing to listen to hard evidence. Anyone using the word "conspiracy" can fuck right off. With all the recent news about Russia, it wouldn't surprise me at all. Yeah, recent news meaning almost all of the last 55 years. https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uzbekistan-incident-raises-suspicions-of-russian-involvement-in-cuba-attacks/  Yup , I think it has something to do with Russia. Why is this being referred to as an "attack", rather than a medical mystery? In other words, how do they know that this was caused by an attack and not something else? Because those involved are specifically embassy personnel. If it were a chemical plant then a medical mystery would be more likely. Assumptions based on collective symptoms and witness reports? Still does not have to mean an attack. As the top comment says eavesdropping gone wrong seems far more likely.  Found the Cuban intelligence officer. Actually thinking about it I agree. If it was some sort of RF or accoustic emitter then a simple sweep would have found it.  Could it be some sort of chemical contamination? And all this time we thought people wearing tin foil hats were the crazy ones.... Sounds like the start to a Fringe episode. I hope suitable recording devices have been set up at the embassy and the homes of embassy personnel. At least that would tell if there was real sound or if it was perceived as a result of something else. There is a recording of it. https://www.apnews.com/88bb914f8b284088bce48e54f6736d84 Sounds like extremely powerful radio waves. I remember a video of some Russian kids touching a plant to a 500kW transmitter and it started singing a high pitched frequency like that. It would make sense with the speculation that it’s a microwave transmitter. Thanks, I forgot it was published already. So there is real sound associated with the attacks, be it the primary weapon or incidental. They are overlooking the obvious.  [Earwigs.](https://i.imgur.com/p5eTkJo.jpg)  They recorded the sound! &gt; The case has plunged the US medical community into uncharted territory.   funny because you'd think US physicians funded by the intelligence community inventing a medical procedure called "rectal feeding" 10 years ago in the same country would have been perceived as uncharted territory.. Huh? Rectal feeding has been around for longer than that. It's use as a form of torture is what *might* have been new. Ir isn’t was used directly for torture though, is it? Just keeping people alive that refuse to eat in order to facilitate more torture? &gt; The most specific finding to date about physical damage from the attacks shows that whatever it was that harmed the Americans, it led to perceptible changes in their brains. It is one of several factors fuelling growing scepticism that some kind of sonic weapon was involved.  Cut the crap.  The CIA knows exactly what this device is, they probably invented it.  Sorry, your cover is blown now.  Just tell us what it is, what kind of damage it's capable of, how often it's been used, what to watch out for, who may have this technology, etc. No, don't. We'll be 3D printing them by the end of the week. I'd rather not have my brain turned to jelly by a troll from 4chan.  U.S. personnel in Cuba are being injured by an unknown weapon, and your response is to turn that into a rant about the CIA?  Aren't you a cynical fuck.  &gt; being injured by an unknown weapon  This is pure speculation, not based on facts. No, he has a point — the CIA probably does know exactly what it is   Otherwise, they’re doing a really bad job keeping tabs on weapon technology, ruuight  You sound like the cynical fuck Exactly; it's the CIA's job to know what this is and invent it if it does not exist yet. the first thing I thought is that hell its probably a CIA anti-surveillance device. blasting out ultrasonic noise to jam somebody else's eavesdropping.  &gt; they’re doing a really bad job  It's the CIA and Cuba. They don't exactly have a great track record there. The blame-america-first crowd never misses an opportunity!  Maybe it was one of these turned up to 11: https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/the-nypd-is-using-mobile-x-rays-to-spy-on-unknown-targets/411181/ Tinfoil hat guy not looking so crazy.  If they did then why not use it against say....the Iranian embassy? Or if you wanted intel on effects why not use it on a mall or federal facility in the States where you can control the exposure to the media? Nothing makes sense about your theory logically, only via emotional bias.  How were they "treated"? What unalters the white matter in your brain? Treated likely means supportive care in this case, there is no treatment for this sort of thing as far as I know. Especially since the cause is unknown. Given the insanity of this, and the tinfoil hat sounding things coming out that sound more like sci fi, I feel at a complete loss for what has happened here.    Honestly, from my own perspective, this seems to sound more like a case of "Something was being used in this location that was either used improperly or was far more harmful than stated". As few, if any, of the potential "weapons" used would make sense, unless a nation somehow developed a new weapon that could be moved and deployed in this one location for whatever reason.     Another part of me thinks, maybe an illness or disease, that also spread in paranoia to others who think they also went down with it? maybe a chemical weapon, but potentially also just a local / new iillness.     Yet my main belief right now sides with something was likely being used that was more harmful than people were led to believe, or that some form of equipment was not properly shielded, or had been used without proper safety precautions. With some being from a nocebo of being around people who had been affected.    all this "Ray gun from far away", or "satellite microwaves" just comes across as a sci-fi / futurology circlejerk that is normally reserved for whenever the term "AI" is used.   People who suffered from Alzheimer's and CTE are only confirmed with post mortem examinations.  Did they figure this out with diviners rods? They diagnose Alzheimer's with MRI, PET scans, and cerebral spinal fluid samples.  They don't have to wait for the person to die.  &gt;The strongest biomarker candidates for Alzheimer's disease include brain imaging studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET), and proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).  https://www.alz.org/research/diagnostic_criteria/ Demyelination or [white matter hyperintensities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperintensity) can be be assessed with MRI, and white matter tractography mapped with [Diffusion Tensor Imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_MRI). I am curious how did they know it was sonic attack? Did some ppl hear sounds? Yes and recorded it. I kinda hope they're quarantined...? gut reaction. Aliens bro. this is all aliens! I want examples of electronics that can beam microwave radiation to people! It sounds a lot like it was some advanced version of technology first seen in The Thing.    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thing_(listening_device)  Listening devices.  Microwave radiation at wavelengths harmful to living tissue.  That didn't seem to matter much to the Russians. This completely creeps me the math out.  This sounds Zika related ADEM. Did they test them for Zika antibodies?   This here's a real headscratcher. Unless it happens again we might never figure it out.  This is some Tom Clancy or Michael Crichton shit!  Possibly a microwave weapon. Hearing "noises can be a symptom of exposure to high energy waves. As a Canadian who has been to Cuba many times. Please please keep up the restrictions on US travel to Cuba.  Sad that you care more about your cheap poverty tourism than the lives of Cubans whose morbid bound economy would be utterly transformed.  American here, but I agree. Went a few weeks ago and I just kept thinking, "we're going to fuck this up sooner than later." Awwww...are we ruining your favorite place to see authentic brown poor people? He's got a point, the moment Americans get to travel to Cuba is the moment that it becomes a cheap ripoff of Las Vegas without the charm.  McDonald's, Starbucks, KFC and all the others, with Cuban cuisine being culturally appropriated.  Megacorporations will make megabillions but the Cuban people will not see one thin dime of it, except perhaps to serve as prostitutes.  American corps will bring in immigrants to work in the casinos and restaurants as Cubans would be accustomed to having workers rights.  The wealth gap between rich and poor in Cuba is almost nonexistent.   Americans just can't seem to go to a place and not try to turn it into America.  Canadian here, you're absolutely right.  [deleted] People always think microwaves but in reality there's only a small portion of the energy spectrum that doesn't cause us a great amount of harm, and many of them are more practical than microwave  Plus people will generally notice when they're being microwaved. They get vision changes and such.  &gt; They get vision changes and such.

Some say they're struggling to concentrate and recall even common words. Yes I am aware. Those symptoms are not consistent with microwave exposure.  [removed] I glad you posted this twice. Just once wasn't off topic enough.
 *Making a documentary with Delay would make them millionaires, or so his story went. All they had to do was work as prostitutes and pass their earnings to him*  How could these girls believe any of this.  He is either the slickest man in the world, or these girls are exceptionally stupid.  They didn't realize that he'd just delay his promises perpetually. pretty sure the term is 'bottom bitch'. 
 "It's a bold strategy, Cotton. Let's see if it pays off for 'em." They are doing the right thing by not paying. Paying would just provide incentive for more attacks. and its a leap of faith trusting these scumbags to actually unlock/decrypt  Exactly there would be nothing stopping them from saying well you payed 26k but we changed our minds were gonna need 26 more. happened to my friends company, they do IT security and a client had essentially opened up his whole business to ransomware attacks, sure enough a guy demanded half a bitcoin.  between delivering the bitcoin and the original demand it had dropped in value, and he wanted more.  That was when the value was just barely above 2500 bucks.  He was banking on the value being less than they would care about, and he was right, they figured it was easier to just find half a bitcoin on the market, buy it and be done with it.  Lucky for them it was un-encrypted but they had no guarantee.   We are woefully unprepared for cyber attacks... you can have all kinds of fancy programs in place but it just takes a clueless employee to screw it all up...  The article says the county got infected by opening up an email attachment with the virus.... that is basically how every company/household gets screwed lol.  Thats why I don't use a computer of any kind. Regardless of what the replies are about to suggest.  Now *this* is the way to validate your backup procedures, betting $26K that they're robust.  Of course, they're a bit less than 100% confident, as they took two days to make a decision.
 Oh they stopped the rampant murder of white farmers across the nation? Nope. I wouldn't go back even if they paid me to if I was him. That's your hometown we're talking about.  Especially if there's sentimental value which can't be replaced, Where do you go?   I have more sentimental value for my life than I do for a patch of dirt. Not everyone thinks like this. I could give fuckall about my hometown. I loved living in my hometown growing up, but quickly said "fuck you" to it when I saw what the mortgage payments would be to live there. The new guy is saying the right things, inclusive, etc. Good luck Zimbabwe Mugabe also said these things, however
 &gt;“Each participant in the Weinstein Sexual Enterprise had a systematic linkage to each other participant through corporate ties, contractual relationships, financial ties, and the continuing coordination of their activities,” the lawsuit adds. Weinstein allegedly employed an “army of spies” to track and intimidate journalists and his alleged victims, the New Yorker reported last month, which plaintiffs’ attorney Steve Berman said is the basis for the RICO allegations.    &gt;“We think these entities, the army of spies, as one article called it, were all facilitating and using wires and mails to orchestrate,” Berman told The Daily Beast. “This A: allowed [Weinstein] to continue doing this over the years, and B: covered it up. When you’re using wires and mails —which are governed by the Racketeering Act — for the illegal purpose of raping and sexually harassing, that falls squarely within RICO.” We need a lawyer in here man, Rose McGowen really fucked up his shit for the rest of his still long life. which is the best part - prolonged suffering for that piece of shit. I want to see what Uma Thurman has in store. I suspect she is withholding until this "round" is all over so she can blast him if he happens to squirm free from most of this. What are the particulars with Uma Thurman? Rumor has it her next movie will be called "Kill Harvey." I hope it's "Uma and Harvey in the the Thunderdome". Most profitable 20 minute film in history. I hope she feels that she is getting vindicated, but honestly it has taken too goddamn long. It's been a twenty year fight for her. That's almost half her damn life spent living with this horrible shit. Let's not forget about Ashley Judd as well. I mean, he's still out of the country. I assume he has a secret account somehow and is never coming back. Gonna do the whole Palanski thing. I guess his life will be different, but still better than most people. I do hope he does face justice though. I wonder what other wealthy and powerful private citizens are employing private intelligence organizations to pursue various agendas  Why this isn't an international incident, I'll never know. Literally using a foreign intel service to facilitate the sexual assault and silencing of US citizens.  I guess certain nations get a pass for that sort of thing! Careful. Thats dangerous territory  We live in interesting times. Where the fuck is RICO? Is this not the very definition of "organized crime?" The guy had a team of ex-Mossad private sector ninjas doing his dirty work for him.  [Black Cube,](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/09/harvey-weinstein-israel-intelligence-firm-black-cube) look into it.  edit: Oh, and he had a fucking hit list! Shit. I missed the bit about mossad. Do you have more on that?  https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/08/ex-israeli-pm-introduced-weinstein-to-agents-who-suppressed-abuse-allegations Or, you know, our president? President is a publicly held position. Trump is not at this time  considered a private citizen while he holds office.  already word that proposals are going around WH for him to use some blackwater type spies.  Starting to wonder if the guy pissed off the wrong people. Piss off enough people...you do the math. I remember reading a rumor that his brother was trying to oust him from their company and that’s how this really all got started.  Sometimes criminals just get caught.  You can't rise to the top without pissing off people. But he had the protection of the clintons and the democratic establishment. Now that the clintons are done and the democratic establishment is in shambles, he is wide open for the taking. Harvey was a major champion of the clintons and his rise and their rise coincided.  http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171009105637-harvey-weinstein-hillary-clinton-2012-large-169.jpg  https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/hillary-harvey.jpg?w=700&amp;h=393&amp;crop=1   I figured heads would roll after hillary's loss, but I didn't realize it would be so widespread. Had hillary won, weinstein would be sitting pretty and would be untouchable. But he bet on the wrong horse and he has no protection.  Wait.. is your entire source of information for this story 2 pictures of Hilary Clinton and him together and the fact that Hollywood is generally liberal?  How, exactly, did the clintons protect him and keep his sex crimes hidden?  Not sure why I’m even asking, I know you’re not going to respond to this. You forgot benghazi, emails, and obama being from mars or some shit Shhh.  We aren’t supposed to talk about that. Talk about what? Two pictures of a donor with a top member of the party he donates too? That seems like the expectation. She knew. Anything that supports that claim?  She’s been married to a rapist for 40 years and she has spent much of that time covering for him and slandering his victims.  She had to have known when she met him that he was a total creep. So that is a no ? Well, no she hasn’t admitted it, if that’s what your saying.  If logic isn’t your thing, then move on. She does not have to admit it but you need some evidence beyond those pictures (which show nothing) and that she is married to Bill (a completely separate person from Harvey). If you had a recorded conversation of those two talking about or some text message logs that would be one thing but right now all you have is a hunch and that is evidence of nothing.  The article mentions criminal stuff like RICO, but this is a civil suit.   [Wikipedia list of famous RICO cases](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act#Famous_cases)    &gt;RICO laws were successfully cited in NOW v. Scheidler, 510 U.S. 249, 114 S. Ct. 798, 127 L.Ed. 2d 99 (1994), a suit in which certain parties, including the National Organization for Women, sought damages and an injunction against pro-life activists who physically block access to abortion clinics. The Court held that a RICO enterprise **does not need an economic motive**, and that the Pro-Life Action Network could therefore qualify as a RICO enterprise. The Court remanded for consideration of whether PLAN committed the requisite acts in a pattern of racketeering activity.    Extortion is included in illegal activities that RICO covers. Harvey did threaten and bribe his victims, and he used PIs and ex-spies to dig up dirt on them to encourage them to stay silent and/or settle. The other people knew about his activities and covered for him. Some helped by scheduling dinners and meetings with women without giving the actresses any warning. [RICO can be civil](https://www.google.com/search?q=rico+civil&amp;oq=rico+civil&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2870j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8). At what point does one of the members of the board at The Weinstein Company walk into Harvey's office, place a pistol loaded with a single round on his desk, and say, "Harvey, just do the honorable thing." before walking out and closing the door behind him while the theme from "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" plays in the background? I feel like the Trailer Park Boys theme would be better. He was fired by the board way back when the news first hit.  True, but they're named in this racketeering suit. Nevertheless, there's no office to go into and no desk to drop a pistol onto.  Do you pick apart every hypothetical situation you read, or is it just this one?  Hell, make it the desk at his home office. Well that would just be trespassing then and while carrying a weapon no less.   For actions that took place before they distanced themselves from him. Denouncing your former criminal associate doesn't absolve you of  having worked with him for decades.  edit: ok I think I see what you were getting at...never....it never happens because they know he would never sacrifice himself for anyone else Use to be in the old days the romans would have a big party for convicted  traitors. All their family would come, they’d drink and eat. Then when the time came, the convicted would walk away and slice his wrist open. This was away to ensure that his family wouldn’t receive any punishment if assume the responsibility.   Surely Harvey as seen The Godfather 2 Like Frank Anselmo in City Hall, huh? Classic.  I want him to do a full Budd Dwyer on live tv.  Wasn't Bud Dwyer innocent?  Why can’t this ogre slip into obscurity already  As soon as he gets justice, sure. Too well connected. Stay tuned.  I read this as Weinstein Accused of R**o**cketeering in New Class-Action Lawsuit   Great another lawsuit instead of a prosecution  Just shoot him already.  It's going to be so hillarious when Weinstein trials inevitably lead back to Bill and Hillary Clinton, the favor exchange for donations, the Weinstein "fundraisers", etc.  And the trump bunga bunga parties at mar lago. Remember when he was a big financial supporter of clinton? But way to use "whataboutism" to down play Weinstein's hundreds of victims. Do you have any clue how stupid that response was after you posted this:  &gt; It's going to be so hillarious when Weinstein trials inevitably lead back to Bill and Hillary Clinton, the favor exchange for donations, the Weinstein "fundraisers", etc.  Probably not, I don't think you have the intellectual wherewithal. I was just surprised that rather than agreeing with me that all these pervs need to be held accountable, you started whining about Trump. Way to play, boss. You got this!  Yup, hopefully there is proof! Did you see the long NYT article about Weinstein? Turns out his protection ran way deep, everyone knew about him being a rapist, even Hillary. The dominoes are starting to fall. 
 We should elect her to political office! Future first lady of France. At minimum she's judiciary material.  She looks like she'd clean up nicely.  Not guilty. She should sell her story to the filmmakers behind Call Me By Your Name. Prime Oscar bait material! Oh. My. God. That guy should be put behind bars forev---  huh?  It was a woman and a 16 year old dude?  nevermind.  I do find it odd that all these articles in the past few years about teachers having inappropriate relationships with students, every time I click on it the teacher is the female.  In my memory I dont know the last time I saw an article like this that involved a male teacher.   inb4 reddit says this is rape and sexual assault
 Could this be from the fact that parity is linked to a decreased risk in breast cancer? So birth control would increase one’s risk because it decreases parity.  most breast cancers are progesterone, or estrogen positive tumors, increasing your hormone levels will increase the risk of these tumors. There are rarer cancers, that are triple negative or not-hormone positive tumors but these are rare and aggressive cancers though. the studies never discusses the parity in correlation with breast cancer, theres probably other studies out there. but this one specifically about hormone use and breast cancer. &gt; Could this be from the fact that parity is linked to a decreased risk in breast cancer? So birth control would increase one’s risk because it decreases parity.  That's not how it works. https://www.google.com/amp/s/parade.com/37175/parade/why-do-nuns-have-a-high-rate-of-breast-cancer/amp/ [Contemporary Hormonal Contraception and the Risk of Breast Cancer](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1700732)  **ABSTRACT**  &gt;Background  &gt;Little is known about whether contemporary hormonal contraception is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.  &gt;Methods  &gt;We assessed associations between the use of hormonal contraception and the risk of invasive breast cancer in a nationwide prospective cohort study involving all women in Denmark between 15 and 49 years of age who had not had cancer or venous thromboembolism and who had not received treatment for infertility. Nationwide registries provided individually updated information about the use of hormonal contraception, breast-cancer diagnoses, and potential confounders.  &gt;Results  &gt;Among 1.8 million women who were followed on average for 10.9 years (a total of 19.6 million person-years), 11,517 cases of breast cancer occurred. As compared with women who had never used hormonal contraception, the relative risk of breast cancer among all current and recent users of hormonal contraception was 1.20 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14 to 1.26). This risk increased from 1.09 (95% CI, 0.96 to 1.23) with less than 1 year of use to 1.38 (95% CI, 1.26 to 1.51) with more than 10 years of use (P=0.002). After discontinuation of hormonal contraception, the risk of breast cancer was still higher among the women who had used hormonal contraceptives for 5 years or more than among women who had not used hormonal contraceptives. Risk estimates associated with current or recent use of various oral combination (estrogen–progestin) contraceptives varied between 1.0 and 1.6. Women who currently or recently used the progestin-only intrauterine system also had a higher risk of breast cancer than women who had never used hormonal contraceptives (relative risk, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.33). The overall absolute increase in breast cancers diagnosed among current and recent users of any hormonal contraceptive was 13 (95% CI, 10 to 16) per 100,000 person-years, or approximately 1 extra breast cancer for every 7690 women using hormonal contraception for 1 year.  &gt;Conclusions  &gt;The risk of breast cancer was higher among women who currently or recently used contemporary hormonal contraceptives than among women who had never used hormonal contraceptives, and this risk increased with longer durations of use; however, absolute increases in risk were small. (Funded by the Novo Nordisk Foundation.)   I'm scared, I have the progestin only arm implant because my fucking doctors said it was safer.  For what it's worth, your risk of breast cancer was always low. Per the NPR story, the increase is equivalent to basically 1 extra case of breast cancer for every 8,000 women on birth control.  But - being on hormonal birth control reduces the risk of other cancers, including endometrial, ovarian, and rectal cancers. I wouldn't be too worried. Talk to your doctor about your concerns, but the overall increased risk is small.  It's understandable to be scared when new information like this is in the news. But I encourage you to use this an opportunity to ask your doctor about this study and what it means to you. This study just came out today (technically it will be printed tomorrow in the NEJM).   Physicians spend most of their lives working to help others (there are exceptions, unfortunately). We don't like finding out that something we did wasn't the best thing for someone. It's literally the exact opposite outcome of why we go into medicine.   The reason that this new information is available is because other doctors spent time doing research to find out how to take better care of their patients. The average physician works 60 hours a week. The people that did this study spent extra time away from their family and friends, probably after seeing patients all day, and will get paid little to nothing for doing this study (in fairness, it does look like it was supported by a grant, so they may have been paid for their time).   The only way medicine could be perfect is if we stop learning new things. If we never learn anything new, everyone will pat themselves on the back for doing the best that we could and go home feeling great.   For what it's worth, this article found a roughly 1 in 8,000 chance of getting breast cancer (which is usually not fatal). To put that in perspective, you have a 1 in 114 chance of dying in a car accident (https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-mortality-risk or http://www.nsc.org/learn/safety-knowledge/Pages/injury-facts-chart.aspx).  Any idea on wether something like an IUD would mean less systemization and less risk compared to an arm patch or pill?  I would presume so, but definitely don't know for sure, drug absorption is unfortunately very complicated. We use pills every day, so we're a lot more comfortable with how they are absorbed. Despite that, I learn something new from a pharmacist every week (thank you, pharmacists, for being so nice to us). Hopefully someone else will chime in here, I know there are lots of docs/pharmDs on reddit that know a LOT more about this than I do. read the r/science thread on this, they seemed pretty skeptical that it was as bad as headlines indicated The implant is a lower dose than the pill. Same with IUD's like Mirena. Also, with Mirena it keeps the hormone "localized", as it was explained to me when I got mine. You're just as likely to die giving birth as you are to get breast cancer from this. Oral birth control is not the *only* option.   True. I was just putting that number in perspective. Why are you scared? Did you actually read the article and the study?  You have a very small increase in your chance for breast cancer. Don't feed into this bullshit. Being scared is what they wanted when they tried to call 13 additional cases in every 100,000 women a significant number. I've known too many people that have been messed up by hormonal birth control. It screwed with my liver values, gave my mother blood clots, and outright nearly killed someone I know via a stroke. But no one talks about this. It's mind blowing to me.  I honestly don't think many people know about the risks.  And they often don't realise how it can mess up other medications.  When a doctor asks people what medications they are on, a lot of people never think to say they are on the pill because they have normalised it as a daily thing and they think medication means 'things I take to cure illness' and forget about the pill. So much this. I remember being in high school and for a lot of girls, it was like a right of passage to start taking the pill. Because God forbid a guy wears a rubber./s  At least in my circles   (woman in University, usually sciences) we all know the risks. And bout half the woman I know still take them because they know guys will give shit about wearing a condom/refuse to. And SO MANY GUYS won't wear one. I have friends who hate it but still take it, because he wants it for sex.  I've known ONE guy in my entire life who was super into condoms every time/safe sex. Everyone else moans and complains, especially if you've been sleeping together over a month.  He's on Reddit, the one who wore condoms, so if you see this Anthony, shout out for being awesome there.   We need to teach men that they can't just demand women get on birth control. But I can't imagine that happening.   I see guys complain about it on Reddit. But my view is if you aren't mature enough to wear a condom, you aren't mature enough to have sex Wow what a reward, he actually cares about the safety of the women and he doesn't even get to raw dog it I have zero problems telling a guy to.shove it. Some ladies don't. But such is life After I found out I had thyroid disease, I got on the pill (for the second time) and I went through three different pills before I was like "fuck it" and I got Mirena.   Best decision I have made in my adult life. I have some spotting, not no discernible cycles. I get pinchy feelings every once in a while, but it's way better than severely heavy periods and debilitating cramps.  It's stuff like this that makes my wife not use any birth control. It's annoying that I have to use condoms to avoid pregnancy in a years long monogamous marriage, but it's better than a baby and she stays healthy.  Get a vasectomy? I've been on the pill for almost six years, I've been strongly considering switching to an IUD. This is all the evidence I need to switch The real kick in the pants is that they already have much safer forms of birth control but they don’t sell them because they work too well. In other words, it’s not profitable because you don’t have to take a pill every day. Always comes down to greed. Would you mind elaborating on this?  I'm curious. No. Take my claim with a grain of salt because unfortunately I read about this probably over a year ago, so I don’t remember the specifics, or my source. However, I can say it was convincing enough to me at the time to remember about its existence.   It may have been a different type of implant that is much safer than current forms of birth control and also worked indefinitely until removed. Because it’s so effective, cheap and long lasting, it wouldn’t be as profitable as the pill for example. Those are the details I remember but again, since I can’t back it up my claim doesn’t hold much water. However I stand by my comment.  Ah okay.  I believe there is the birth control that men can take.  I vaguely remember reading there were trials in Europe for that, but for various reasons I don't think that would be a success because generally (not always) it's the woman who has the highest stake in not getting pregnant, so I wonder how much trust women would put in men on being diligent taking birth control.  I'm sure there will be better ways in the future, science is always coming up with new things, and we're always figuring out ways to get around obstacles. I dated a guy once who told me that if an oral contraceptive for men would "even make [his] dick hang slightly to the left" he wouldn't take it.   Like there could be absolutely no side effects.   And lots of men have that mentality. Not saying all men, but they don't want anything even slightly adversely affecting their junk.    Well, for married men like me we would definitely take it. Obviously I’m just as on the hook for any kids we have, and at the same time condoms suck to wear. Incidentally, my wife also hates using the pill. I plan on getting snipped after the next kid. She wants three though so that will be a fun conversation to have. Right now all of the male contraception injection options are horibble. It's just a low dose of test e or c with synthetic estogren (bodybuilder steroid). It dramtically lowers your testosterone, and let me tell you, lowering your testosterone to 0 and replacing it with outside testosterone is a big deal. You would not be able to stop taking the injections, screwing with the HTPA feedback axis destroys your ability to produce testosterone and the various estrogens you need to function on your own. You would be dependant on injections for the rest of your life, unless you used dangerous anti breast cancer drugs (SERMs) to restart your hormonal axis.  I feel bad for woman having to bear the brunt of contraception, but the fact is they don't have an HTPA axis like men. Introducing exogenous hormones does not destroy their ability to produce testoserone or various estogrens. Right now, your best bet is definitely a vasectomy. I hear good things about vasogel as well. But the male birth control shot is not in the near future. Funnily enough the pill actually lowers libido for a certain percentage of women too....googles...between 15 and 30 per cent.  Seems oral bc just isn't great either way, huh.  Let's hope other options will pop up soon. Sure.  I was thinking more with casual sex, or new relationships really.  From a woman's pov a guy could just skip off into the sunset in those circumstances.  I guess if the side affects for male oral bc was far less than what woman have now than it would be a winner in commited relationships.   IIRC its a gel injected into the ovarian tubes or testis that is effectively a vasectomy. The gel could be removed. Effectively an easily reversible vasectomy .  Major props to The NY Times for fully explaining the statistics.  Nice changes from clickbait articles where they have play with the statistics to make a bigger story I just dont trust the pill.  Im legite afraid of getting a blood clot, and the few months I was on the pill it really fucked me up.  I do wonder if its a great idea for young girls should go on it so early, before they settle into their cycle...thats become a thing these days, and I know there are legite reasons for some girls/women and that's cool- we alll need to cope in life so I don't begrudge that, individuals need to weigh these things up and there should always be the option.  But if you have a relatively pain free cycle I just dont think the risks of going on the pill, especially for years without a break are worth it.   I had a blood clot on the pill when I was 20 and found out afterwards I have Factor V Leiden. In hindsight, I'm very glad it happened then and not during a pregnancy where the risk of clotting is many times higher than being on the pill and would have probably put me and the fetus in a lot more danger. I use a copper IUD now and am very happy with it. Hopefully I can get sterilized in the future.  For many women, the pill is the easiest solution for being in a heterosexual relationship. Most effective methods (&gt;99%) are hormonal besides the copper which I have. Unfortunately, a lot of women don't get on too well with it because of the heavier periods and some women convince themselves they're being poisoned with copper which is just not good for their mental health.  What we need is effective birth control for men besides vasectomies. Condoms are great but they break and can be tampered with. My partner has a vasectomy.  But the pill made me anxious depressed and suicidal and really fucked with my mind (I was on it to regulate my cycle).  On top of that I was worried about getting a clot because my mother did and they said it was likely birth control.  So after I stopped...I decided it wasn't worth it.  We do need better birth control.  The more options the better.   I have a prescription from my OB and I'm still waffling about whether I want to take it. My husband and I, historically, have a 100% success rate pulling out, and between the risks to me, my experience with moodiness while on another pill, and my superstitious dislike of taking anything while I'm breastfeeding, and the fact that we want to get pregnant again about a year from now... ugh. I mean, I'll probably take it. But research like this just makes me even less happy about it. Will be glad when we are done having kids and my husband can just get snipped.  Everyone’s experience with medication is different, and just like with medication for an illness, you often have to shop around for the right birth control. If it makes you feel better, your chances of getting breast cancer are slim before the pill (unless you have one of the other risk factors like smoking), and the pill is pretty easy to stop whenever.  It took me a couple different tries to get the right one for me. I now take Marlissa (combined pill) and my cycle is regular, my periods are much lighter, and it’s helped with some general everyday anxiety.  If you really don’t want to take the pill, IUD’s have a very low failure rate and (generally) you can conceive within a week or so of removal. Again, it might take a few different tries before you find the right one that meshes with you.  Obviously, I’m not a doctor. I’d recommend you talk to your doctor, especially if you really don’t want to take the pill. They can help you find a good BC method that works for you and your husband’s needs. Being on the pill is much safer than being pregnant in young women.  Okay?  But you know there are more than just two options.  You don't have to choose between 'pregnant' and 'being on the pill' there are other options. Like what? Condoms? Abstinence? No thanks.  There are more than those options.   First of all, condoms is a good idea if you're not in a monogamous relationship because the downside to that is STDs *and* pregnancy.  And some STDs are worse than pregnancy.   Or you could have non-penetrative intimacy.  Or if you're in a mongamous relationship and you don't want kids the guy can get a vasectomy.   There is also the nuvaring, or an IUD.  There are about 20 different birth control options you know.  &gt; condoms is a good idea if you're not in a monogamous relationship   I'm in a monogamous marriage and I still use condoms. They're cheap and easy.  First of all, yes, I use condoms, but I don’t want to use *only* condoms. That is too high risk for me. I also don’t *just* want non penetrative intimacy, I want sex. I’m not in a monogamous relationship. And most of the hormonal birth control options, like nuvaring and the patch, come with similar cancer risks because they’re the same hormones.  Well, if you're afraid of pregnancy IUD (non hormonal) has a higher success rate than condoms or oral contraceptives.  But do whatever you want, I don't care.  As long as people know all the options and all the risks then the point is to have as many options as possible.  As I said before, sometimes people need to take the pill for whatever reason, and people should do whatever makes their life easiest. Huh. I was just a child at the time but I specifically remember my grandmother saying that birth control pills and breast cancer were somehow linked. This was around forty years ago.  Yes, which is why the article said 'still'  in the early years it was linked to breast cancer...they refined the pill and the risk became much lower.  That was my understanding before reading the article. My doctor always asks first with some types if I have history of breast cancer in my family. I think the patch type is known to increase the risk of breast cancer but decrease the risk of ovarian and colon cancer. Wouldn't be surprised if this varies from different types.  Hm, how long until we find out that hormone replacement therapy causes cancer as well?  Because those are far larger doses. We know that; it does.  &gt;small but significant increase  Pick one.  &gt;That is, for every 100,000 women using hormonal birth control, there are 68 cases of breast cancer annually, compared with 55 cases a year among nonusers.  Okay, so not really significant, then. Definitely not worth the pain and suffering of motherhood.  It’s really not. As long as you don’t fit any of the other risk factors, you should be fine. As someone who is way too young for a child, a method like the pill is super convenient because it is easy to stop if I want to have a kid. It also helps to regulate periods and sometimes ease symptoms of PCOS/endometriosis.   I would much rather have a slightly increased risk of breast cancer (when my risk was already slim) than have an irregular cycle/risk becoming pregnant. I mean, I do have some of the other risk factors and it's still not threatening to me. I have a hormonal IUD primarily to control menorrhagia and if a small increase in my risk for breast cancer is what it takes for no babies and control of my blood faucet, well... I'll take that chance.  To the best of my knowledge, I have no other risk factors. Even if I did, like you, I would likely not find it a threat unless my doctor was concerned. I started on the pill because my cycle was beyond irregular (I could go a few months between periods or just a week)  and i was about to leave for college. I’ve been on it for about 5 months and have had no ill-effects.  People tend to forget that the risk is slim even without taking BC. Being this is the internet, I'm sure I'll get crucified here - but there is always natural family planning - modern methods of monitoring female fertility and then - gasp - simply not having sex during those times. Inconvenient, yes. But medically, perfectly safe.  And it does work for some - though it's not for everyone.  This article just gives more information - and NFP is just another option for those who wish to choose it - but it is a valid option that should be mentioned. Up to each person to know all the facts then decide based on their own situation. So... babies or cancer... not an easy choice. Especially since having babies does not mean you'll never get cancer. Literally all forms of birth control have side effects. None of them are safe. Literally no.  Having a partner whose had a vasectomy has no side effects for women (unless in a very low chance that their procedure failed).  So, there is that. I think the side effects of a vasectomy (or tubal/essure sterilization on a woman) would be that it's invasive/requires healing and is, for the most part, permanent. For some of us, this isn't a problem, but sometimes communicating that is an issue (doctors won't believe that you just don't want babies) but that takes it completely off the table for most young people who are just looking for prevention until they want to start a family.  There are side effects for the man, such as potential pain while orgasming for months after the surgery. I'd call that a side effect.  Any surgery, even as ‘mild’ as a vasectomy, has side effects for the patient. It usually comes in the form of general aches and pains during healing but there are side effects. The effect on the partner has little matter.  At the moment, there are no perfect forms of BC. The only one with a 100% effectiveness is abstinence. The others all have some side effect and can fail. [deleted] This is a story in the NYT. Sorry about your theory.  What're you talking about?  So bc has been out for 20+ years, and it's just NOW being linked to cancer? Yes, exactly. It can take decades to determine correlations between medications and certain cancers, because certain cancers take decades to develop.  Not exactly. It’s been known there’s a link, but the pill was reformulated to reduce the risk. This study mostly shows the risk is still there. There’s not much to worry about because the risk is still very slim (only 13 more cases per 100,000).  As another commenter states, it also does take years to learn the long term effects of a medication, especially if it is reformulated/changed. Hormonal medication can also be extra complicated because hormones effect everyone differently. This is one of the reasons you need to be open and honest with your doctor regarding medications.
 I hate when that happens. The fire department started charging me every time to boot.  This has only happened to me twice Sounds like a sticky situation. I'm sure the microwave surreptitiously recorded the whole thing. I don't think he was "done" in 3 minutes.
 This is a NJ driver. I'm not surprised.

 That guy is a doctor??      &gt;Complaints to the hospital and the college of physicians allege that after removing the toe, Smyth put it between his clenched knuckles, jutting upwards to make the “f--- you” sign to a female nurse.     Ha! Truth really is stranger than fiction. What I find most amazing is that a person with this kind of status has such an unrefined sense of humour.   Lloyd Christmas was right, Aspen chalet parties are nothing but off-colour jokes and blue angels.  Yeah, nothing about that skull shirt says "refined sense of humor".
 I'm confused. I thought they admitted it was accidental and he fell to his death, or is this a different one? No that was a random local police chief or sheriff that said it might have been a vehicle. As a bpa myself, I'm fairly sure he he had no idea how we work and track to determine if others were previously in the area This. A local law enforcement official suggested they might have been run off the road by a tractor trailer since it’s been known to happen.   But border patrol has stated from the beginning that the two officers were assaulted and one was essentially beaten to death.  &gt; But border patrol has stated from the beginning that the two officers were assaulted and one was essentially beaten to death.  Has the actual BP put out a statement saying that? The only one I've seen is a quote from a Union rep who represents the BP in no way at all. Nah border patrol has been saying since day one it was an attack, the media tried to spin it to say it was an accident.     Who attacked him? Cartels smuggling in undocumented immigrants or drugs? The article seems to suggest that one of several informants was a ‘coyote’ who smuggled people across the border, and that several of the people he smuggled were the ones who attacked the agents.   Being that the article states they have names, destinations, a travel route, and even the make and model of the car the suspects were driving in, it’s very likely this is legit.  &gt; Being that the article states they have names, destinations, a travel route, and even the make and model of the car the suspects were driving in, it’s very likely this is legit.  I'd hold off on that assumption. This wouldn't be the first, or last, time that a confidential informant is full of shit.  At the very least, it shows the FBI believe it was an attack over a truck hit and run. Except two brothers were in Mexico two days before they were arrested. Do you think illegals come over twice? And especially after they killed a bp agent? You can say illegal immigrants
 We have treatments that stop bleeding already, but this actually means the body produces its own clotting factors, which is huge.   Most haemophiliacs are on prophylactic treatments of recombinant (using animal cells to produce clotting factors) factor in order to prevent bleeds. It's not fool proof and bleeds are still a common occurrence. For me at least going a whole year without bleeds would be fantastic.       I think this calls for a cupa  Last time a royal prince was involved in stopping hemophilia it didn't end so well for the guy. The royals will be pleased to hear this Did he build a time machine and stop his ancestors from inbreeding? That's not how haemophilia works. Like most genetic conditions inbreeding means that it stays within the gene pool but it's not the cause.   Genetic mutations are just a part of life.    Source: am a 1st generation haemophiliac whose parents are not related.  Well alright alright alright....now they can get back to all that inbreeding that they so loved.   The things you do for that Genius trait.
 But he stressed that the Russian government wouldn't be able to help them cheat since they aren't competing officially.... I watched the documentary "Icarus" on Netflix last night.. it's about the guy who broke the entire Russian doping story.  If you're interested don't miss it.. it's quite a story. I watched it and it was pretty lame.  The marketing called it the "greatest ever documentary" but it was just meh. Username checks out.  Russian doper does not approve of Icarus. Putin also would not stop individuals competing at the 2018 Olympics from dying of polonium poisoning on their own account. If you're going to repeat the same joke we've all heard a million times, at least put a little effort into it. Maybe the issue is that the half life of the joke is very short.... Does the value of the joke deplete more or less quickly depending on the contents of the joke? That is a broken question, the depletion of the joke is at an exponencial rate, at a half-life of its substance. Now its volume, the mass that we are concerned with and its value, is only the question of once preference. Like plutonium its only useful to thuse who want to use it.   *So no mutially exclusive veriables  Instead, he'll just have their families killed.  I would think the chance to take a gold away from another country could be just as sweet for him so why wouldn’t he? It's not like it's a Super Bowl ring That guy can go suck a bag of dicks. The hired goons he had silently standing behind him pounding their fists gave a different impression. I thought you CAN'T compete in the Olympics unless you're doing so on behalf of a country, and if Russia is banned doesn't that mean No Russians Allowed? They would compete under the Olympic flag - https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-suspends-russian-noc-and-creates-a-path-for-clean-individual-athletes-to-compete-in-pyeongchang-2018-under-the-olympic-flag They can go on their own but nothing about them can represent Russia. For example no flags on their uniforms or flown in the opening ceremony.  So what happens if they win a medal? "Some random shmuck won silver." Instead of actually adding to their countries score. That just seems so weird. Human from planet Earth wins!  Damn, Earth won all the medals again? They'd participate under a neutral flag, with no anthem if I remember correctly. The IOC made sure to stress that no matter how many Russians go and medal, it will still show as 0 for the country as a whole maybe the "Unified Team" can make a comeback for this Olympics But history will just show Russia with an asterisk for any winners.   Maybe there will be a story worthy of a movie about it later, like Cool Running's or Miracle in Ice.  Kuwait athletes did it in 2016 and won a gold and bronze Vladdy is just going to kill their parents. Or make them compete as Ukraine's.  That's a stretch,  first he'd have to recognize Ukraine as a country. Oh they recognize Ukraine. At least the Ukraine that was their puppet. Wouldn't it be grand, if the IOC just ignored the Russian athletes? No announcements for any of them, or any mention of who they are. Just impose a complete shutdown. They get up on a podium to get a medal and receive... Nothing. They get as little camera time as physically possible without making the effort ridiculous.   It would be so beautiful.  Did someone ask Vlad what he would do? Why?
 This isn't just any pathologist, it's Dr. Bennet Omalu, the guy who discovered CTE in NFL athletes, who Will Smith played in that movie.  That guy doesn't strike me as a guy that does a lot of lying, or one that's bad at his job. When the movie came out, a lot of brain researchers were upset that he claimed to have discovered and named CTE: http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/12/17/concussion-bennet-omalu-nfl/   &gt; In the PBS documentary “League of Denial,” Omalu also claims credit for discovering and naming the disease. “Name it a disease; give it a name. Present it as a disease; package it,” he said, explaining that he had taken a class in business school where they discussed how to create brand equity. “‘Chronic’ means long-term. ‘Traumatic’ means it’s associated with trauma. ‘Encephalopathy’ means a bad brain. So I had both ends covered.”    &amp;nbsp;   &gt; At the time of Webster’s autopsy, though, the disease had been known — and known by that name — for decades. It's a very logical name, following an established pattern.    Once you understand Latin medical naming, the names of conditions like this are usually super obvious and usually follow that pattern.   So the fact that it was the "same name" does not mean much.    Or maybe he'd heard the term somewhere before and it stuck subconsciously.  It's like everyone who screams when someone says Christopher Columbus discovered America. Maybe he wasn't the first European over here but when he discovered it, it stayed discovered. Columbus was a dick. He lied and claimed he'd seen land the night before, after the morning Watchmen spotted it and screamed out. The man to spot land first was owed a bounty, of course. Do you have any idea how many historical figures were dicks? Or how many currently famous people are also dicks?  Funny how racist assholes end up in the history books and become heroes for 3rd graders the world over, eh? Aye, hilarious. "History is rarely made by reasonable men"  This is true for all cultures. Columbus was a real piece of work even by 15th Century standards though. A lot of what we know about Columbus is taken from a hit piece by a single author who had a hard on for trying to vilify Europeans.  He took only accounts from Columbus's men, awko hated Columbus cause was a bit hard on his men, not allowing them to rape and such.  Every man who was willing to do what hadn't been done was going to be driven and unapologetic. It's why they did what they did. Of course they're gonna be dicks to some extent. "Stayed discovered" to white European leaders who were in the beginning stages of global colonization. Pretty sure it stayed discovered to the people that had been living there for generations tho.   E: i guess we are downvoting facts in favor of poor analogies today. ight reddit It had been discovered many times over by many different cultures. We have evidence Norwegians fished our east coast, we've found chinese records indicating our land, old maps, etc etc. The only reason it "stayed discovered" is because what you said -- There wasn't room in England for people and the surrounding lands were established. They just didn't care to colonize it.  Although I will say, people get very annoyed by hearing anything about the indigenous people.  Also, the fact that you said "white" instead of just european can be seen as racist to some.  Personally, I couldn't give two fucks about almost anything -- Just showing you how the hive-mind here reacts to shit. Until California starts hanging the Sheriffs departments out to dry, nothing will changed.  After seeing how it worked in my state, I think you've got to start with the Sheriff's departments if you want change in law enforcement    They are the bastion of good-old-boy politics that empowers the rest of the bad actors.  Tulsa, Oklahoma fucking decapitated it's Sheriff's department after bad shit went down--and now every department in the state is really, really careful about shooting people.  Go after the guys at the top, or nothing will change.    Oklahoma City took the hint and dropped the hammer on one of their cops who was a serial rapist.  He's now serving 200+ years.  Currently we have an officer going to trial for shooting a gun at someone who was threatening to light themselves on fire in an act of suicide Look at how most of the CA Sheriffs depts. hand out CCWs here and you will see how fucked it is. In most cases you have to be a high dollar Sheriff re-election donor to even get close to one. Santa Clara and LA county are two noteable ones who were caught doing this. Different laws and perks if you have $$$$ to donate, everyone else is fucked over. Funny how gun control enables that sort of shit. And it's even more ironic that those same liberals constantly rail against police misconduct, when one of the very things toot their moral horn about enables the same police misconduct gun control has always been about disarming the poor minorities...the loopholes and exceptions are always available for the elite. Not letting felons and mentally unstable people have guns is about disarming the poor minorities?  When the system unfairly targets minorities for prosecution, yes.  If rich white kids went to jail for drugs at the same rate that poor white or black kids do, things might be different.  You think those kids driving mommys hand me down bmw smoke less weed or pop less molly?  Be real. While I agree drug charges do target as you say, I don't think taking gun rights away is the *goal* of that, it's just a side effect.   Whats with the downvotes?  How is continuing slavery not insidious? The gun control policies are only so strict in california(with the support of the NRA I might add) because they were afraid of black people protecting themselves.  [And Ronald Reagan signed it into law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulford_Act?wprov=sfla1).  Not sure why I was downvotwd for being right. But but but THOSE SCARY PISTOL MODS WILL THREATEN THE CHILDREN! i ask this in all seriousness because i am dumb sometimes before coffee:   how does gun control allow police misconduct?  Because people cannot defend themselves you mean?  I doubt it would stop police misconduct really. really the only thing that forces reform of police departments is the oversight of the feds... and I really doubt the current DOJ cares at all about corrupt police. In fact they ended an important oversight program  https://www.aclu.org/blog/mass-incarceration/smart-justice/jeff-sessions-guts-federal-oversight-policing-it-opens-door In a state like Cali?  Police  run the show like 1960's teamsters if they have to.  If you want any reform done you'll have to attack the corruption at its source: police unions unions! drink!  police oversight is fixed by federal programs, in a purely coincidental move, Trump's DOJ ended such programs Also a major reason why. Many of the programs started by previous administrations have been defunded by trumps administrations.  Reforming from the federal level is much easier than doing it inside your own city.  My home town had a bad cop problem. Any attempts at reforms over the years were shot down by the unions because they had so much political power.  It took a major cover up, dead pedestrians, and a federal probe into the department to see any changes unions protecting their people is not shocking and if you get rid of a unions ability to do that it can cause a lot of unintended consequences, that's the reason feds have to be involved  It's great, the left thinks unions are infallible, while the right refuses to oversee police creating a total lack of accountability. Neither side is actually correct, and both are empowering a police force who desperately need to be put in their place.  You need to look at it from a fresh perspective. Conservatives, be tough on crime. Ensure that the police aren't criminals. Liberals, don't empower a group that already holds all of the cards by allowing their out of control unions to continue pushing laws that eliminate accountability. Cops, it isn't an excuse to say "I just want to do my job and keep my head down" if you are going to cry about the perception of your career choice. If your job is to enforce the law, that means you enforce the law whether the criminal wears a badge or not. If you can't do that, then it's time to shut up because you know your profession is corrupt enough that you can't do the right thing, and the perception is deserved.   &gt; the left thinks unions are infallible  damn good thing nobody ever made this claim then Oh, yada yada yada, love those arguments from the point of pedantry rather than any attempt to think outside the bounds of the standard partisan garbage. Unions are a problem in city police departments.  The sheriff is an elected official with the usual sleaze that can entail.  But at the end of the day it *is* an elected position and voters could immediately clean house if they wanted to.   No police union can prevent an elected official like a Sheriff from being ran out of office on a rail on corruption charges.  Recapture the Sheriff's department and you'll recapture your police.  A union can however, protect city cops.       "He was shot and killed by the officer. The wounds show that he was running away and shot in the back."  "Yeeeaaahhh, I'm going to change this to suicide."  "What? The subject didn't have a gun, and the video shows that..."  "Such a tragedy, someone so young with so much to live for, you know?"  "Please listen, the officer admitted that..."  "S-U-I.. S? How do you spell suicide?"  "..." "Suiside by Cop" is a legitimate form of suiside! He fucked with the wrong pathologist How quaint...I'd be willing to be my entire 401K that nothing will happen. Possibly some paid leave, a "stern" talking to behind closed doors, a phony press release, laying low for a few days, and then business as usual for the police. normally i would agree with you...  This has all the makings of being different I really hope so! For this to be different you need activist boots on the ground constantly harrying the bad guys with social and legal pressure.  Make no settlements, give no quarter, drive them from office.  I don't see why.  It's another example of cops covering up their crimes, which we have an unlimited number of examples every day, but which never have any impact because quite simply a large portion of the public wants the police to be above the law, and wants them to beat and kill criminals at their discretion.  Or worse, they actually just believe everything the cops say.  There are a lot of people who think that cops should just be able to Judge Dredd away all the bad guys, and will always, always support any attempt to shield cops from consequences. The pathologist is something of a celebrity for his NFL CTE stuff. Might not change much, but it gives a credible name to the claim. Did you see that it's Dr. Omalu? I'm usually skeptical about scandals involving police departments seeing any justice, but his name will bring a lot more attention. No, he fucked with the right pathologist long enough to make that pathologist quit.  The tampering will continue, and any new pathologist hired will know *exactly* what to write and how to write it when dealing with officer involved deaths.  The San Juaquin Sheriff's department *won*.  The truth, and public have *lost.* You are usually correct. But I hope and think you are wrong here It's good to have hope.  But it is bad to be deluded *by* hope. I actually think something good is going to happen in this particular case only because of who the pathologist is. It is not in his nature to let this go.. I am most certainly a "hope for the best, prepare for the worst" type of person.  How refreshing to find a couple of people willing to stand up for what's right, in the face of police corruption. so the sheriff is going to jail? if by "jail" you mean "paid administrative leave" then ... probably? And if by "fine" you mean that's exactly how he'll be doing when he's promoted upon his return. Oh sweetie... My mom's boyfriend is in his late 80's. He's got stories. His various county sheriffs over the years embezzled in the 2000's, shook down dealers and sold drugs in the 80's and the 90's, and bootlegged liquor through the 30's and the 40's.  "All these small counties are full of crooks" Who is the coroner? In most places they don't even have to be medicly trained. The one I met at was a retired cop.      "San Joaquin County’s two forensic pathologists resigned in recent days over what they said was intolerable interference by Sheriff-Coroner Steve Moore."   If I am reading this right the sheriff is also the coroner.  Correct - common arrangement in CA, unfortunately. Yeah. I went to school with a guy whose dad was police, then ran for coroner, apparently it's similar salary compared to a sheriff, but I think it's more of an administrative rather than medical role. This is hilarious.  I just don't understand why we still elect these positions.  Only in America (I think.)  In Canada our judges and coroners are appointed by and serve as non-partisan civil servants so that they're not politically biased. Sounds more like Sandford. The greater good... The greater good... Another article about this alleges that the sheriff-coroner cut the hands off the bodies at the morgue for no reason. [Super weird.](http://www.kcra.com/article/san-joaquin-county-medical-examiner-sheriff-cut-off-hands-at-morgue/14106094) Once upon a time, I was a Deputy Sheriff in San Joaquin County.  This doesn't surprise me. Hey that’s that CTE NFL concussion guy Will Smith. Oh no, that's the *real* Will Smith, his first name is Dr.! This is why Dallas happened you fucks. This mother fucker needs to be locked up. Same newspaper that gave Fresno cops John Lang IP address.... &gt; John Lang  It appeared to me that John Lang was developing some type of schizophrenia, but now with this revelation, I don't know what to believe.  Sounds like the sheriff is selling body parts imo. That's a shame. Joaquin Pathologist was so good in Gladiator and Her. The general rule is that physicians, unless they have moral integrity, become agents of the State.  In other words, politician bureaucrats, as a matter of practice, if allowed, will use physiciians as a means to an end.  Umm no? These people have devoted their entire adult lives to a single vocation and in most doctors cases, have sworn oaths to protect and heal. So take your /r/conspiracy rhetoric else were  Although I do agree that /u/Puffin_fan is incorrect in his/her statement, I don't believe /r/conspiracy is the right place for him/her for the following reasons.   * He/she never once mentioned Alex Jones as a credible source.  * He/she has not mentioned the Je... "Globalist" agenda.   * He/she did not bring up Clinton's emails despite having no bearing on the current discussion.   I would suggest /r/conspiracyII for /u/Puffin_fan as a better alternative to visit.  Hes not saying most doctors abandon integrity.  He said that doctors without integrity become agents of the State and are used by politicians.  Please read a little more closely before you rant and rave. Physicians, like any one else , can be influenced by offers of money, power, status, reward, and recognition.  In fact, physicians are generally more susceptible - and I'm not sure why, it may have something to do with problems in the medical admission process amd the medical schools themselves.  Ackshually it's janitors. They are the true agents of the state. They have access everywhere, and are predisposed to espionage. It's something in their DNA. Plus they're made in a lab, which basically proves everything I've said.  even though what you say is true in theory, as of late doctors have become little more than pharmaceutical poison peddlers and those that don’t “conform” are black listed and loose their licenses. I can’t remember her name but she lost her job as a doctor for treating patients with cheaper wholistic variants that once her peers found out they ostracized her because she wasn’t using a big pharma solution. She isn’t the first nor will she be the last... it’s not always a conspiracy just because it seems inconceivable. "As of late..." Yah sure... Doctors haven't really changed, but conspiracy theories have certainly gained a greater foothold in the midst of the internet driven post-truth culture we are currently dealing with. Our medical science is better than it has ever been and we are literally doing miraculous things that wouldn't have been possible 20 years ago, and you call it poison peddling. Yet inevitably you will of course seek treatment for your medical problems and never once be thankful that you aren't living in a time or place without modern medical science. I thought the rule was: A doctor is just a serial killer with better parents. 
 "The population of Nanking just before the Japanese occupation was about 200,000. About a week before the Japanese attack on Nanking, on November 28, 1937, the head of the Police Department of Nanking, Mr. Wan, announced at a press conference for foreigners, "About 200,000 people still live here in Nanking." Five days after the Japanese occupation, on December 18, 1937, the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone, which was a group of Westerners remaining in Nanking, announced that the population of the city was about 200,000. Later, on December 21, the Foreigners Association in Nanking referred to 200,000 as the population of Nanking.  How could the Japanese kill 300,000 citizens in a city that held only 200,000 people?  One month after the Japanese occupation, many Nanking citizens who had escaped the city came back to Nanking, learning that peace had returned, and the population increased to about 250,000. There is a record that the Japanese troops distributed food to that number of citizens. On January 14, 1938, about one month after the Japanese occupation, the International Committee announced that the population of Nanking had increased to about 250,000."  http://www2.biglobe.ne.jp/remnant/nankingm.htm  EDIT: You've got a  problem with HISTORICAL, VERIFIABLE facts, people? Redditors don't like being reminded of Axis atrocities. Especially since so many of them a riding the current worldwide far-right wave. 
 "I usually make a sandwich and put in a couple of energy bars and maybe some fruit. Last night I must've mistaken my fridge Glock for an apple. Honest mistake.." &gt;Fridge Glock  Well, looks like it's time to add another to the collection... &gt; fridge Glock  Wouldn't it get all moldy? Not if it's in a ZipGlock bag. Get out. Just get out.   *points to the door* Don't forget a siliGat packet.  Is glock. Is fine. You have to keep a box of Armed and Hammered in the fridge next it to keep it fresh. It’ll still shoot, though. TSA: For when you are so bad at your job the only guns you can find are the ones you brought with you. "mistakenly packed a gun in his lunch"- what the actual fuck.  This is not an acceptable excuse.  Imagine saying that shit to a TSA agent at the airport.  Pretty sure you or I would be facing serious charges.  This agent got caught red-handed trying to breach security and needs to be made an example of.  Also, make him take his fucking shoes off.   and get his junk checked, then go into secondary screening, with addition bag check, where things go missing  This actually happens more often than you think. No charges are every usually filed. A lot of the times, it is a honest mistake No, you'd be questioned and if it were an honest mistake it'd be up to the local TSA manager to prosecute or just let you go. This guy probably made his lunch at 2 am for his morning shift at 4. Ever been forgetful at the wee hours of the morning? Sometimes when I’m forgetful I miss a deadline at work. Or fail to call a friend on their birthday.     I have yet to accidentally grab my glock when intending to make a tuna sandwich for tomorrow’s lunch.  Man you really love the TSA huh yikes With a gun? !? Absolutely not. There is no way that this was some flakey mistake. If it were a can of beer instead of a can of soda, maybe. But a gun? Nope. It's his job! If he's making mistakes like this, then he should not be working security.  Actually, it would be up to the local police.  The TSA has neither the discretion nor the authority to make an arrest.   Obviously we need a TSASA Who watches the Watchmen Watch Watchers? Rolex mechanics.  Then who watches the Watchmen Watch Watcher Watchmakers?  ... wtf is a watch? TSA are the same people from the DMV... just with epaulettes. Incompetent. The people at the DMV are much nicer and they don't grab my vag. I wasn't aware the DMV employed former National Guardsman,  Air Force Air traffic controllers, and bachelor educated college graduates. It does. The DMV is pretty indiscriminate in their hiring, as long as you have decent history with previous employers and aren’t a convicted felon. The groups of people you listed are pretty good people to hire because they are seen by the public to have good work ethic and authority, excluding college graduates. College grads are also usually recently educated and are more up to date on technology, which helps in an aging workforce. I'm not really good at the odd holidays. Was it Take Your Slaughter to Work Day? Honey its getting close to midnight  And all the myths are in town   Matter of fact, you've got two minutes to midnight...  The hands that threaten dooooooom How is this news? Who cares its all theater anyway Funny. How many terrorist incidents have occurred that involved aviation since 2001 in the US. One in 2003. How about the rest of the world? A dozen. So where is their "theater?"  How many before?    I can use your logic to say I prevent the Soviet Union from reforming.    I have a rock that repels tigers. The range on that thing must be huge! It's working all the way over here. How many terrorists has the TSA caught?   They finally found one! He just brought the wrong iron supplement. Honest mistake. Hey guess what. It’s none of our business. 
 Wonder what the 450 million dollars was really for.  Money laundering 101 we are not far from the billion dollar art number. I'm curious how far this appreciation-depreciation scam can keep going.  It's bizarre. This sold for like 50 million http://i.imgur.com/BkZSoKG.jpg god, what a waste of a perfectly good wall.  No, no, you buy the wall to get the stripe. Blind reaction here: What's preventing anyone from painting that? Semi-serious response from someone who isn't an art historian:  Barnett Newman (the painter of the above) is a pretentious twit, but not necessarily an insignificant painter.  With works like this, context is important: not only its immediate context in the artist's career, but its historical context.  Newman would feed you some crap about how 'sublime' it was (he didn't know what the word meant) or how bold he was, or affix some preposterous title.  There is also an implicit irony in a moderately important painter doing something like this: it leads the viewer to ask questions like yours ('where's the skill or value in this?') that are usually answered only with recourse to the fame of the artist.  Ultimately, though, it usually comes down to two things:  1) Do you like the picture, and why?  2) Do you think it's a important picture, and why? I've actually been mulling this over all day, so here's my second response:  While you, or I, or anything else could grab some blue paint and splash up someone that was really close to this, there is an argument that we wouldn't be able to tell the difference between our shoddy painting and a similar but more refined one.  By analogy, my wife's a classically-trained composer, but she's written a few pieces of art song that play on pop, jazz, and other musical genres. The pop-ish ones, for example, sound *like* pop songs, but they're way more complex than that. You could throw them into the 'Top 40', and they wouldn't sound out of place-- just kind of momentarily unusual, sort of like if Pitbull suddenly starting German. But beyond that are levels of musical sophistication that are basically inaudible to most people who don't have a deep understanding of music theory. Similarly, the jazz-y pieces sound like jazz, but there's no improvisation: just really complex, fully-notated passages that sound improvisatory (and drive pianists up the wall).  Barnett Newman, I'm sure, would say something similar: that the difference between his 'white zip on blue' and yours or mine depends upon craft that you and I simply don't appreciate. As such, when you or I say, 'why we could do that!' we would be (he would claim) exposing our ignorance.  It's basically a giant post-modernist bluff. This is art because I say it's art, and if you don't get it, you're uncool. The trick is knowing whether to call the bluff or not, and how. You could by ten Babe Ruth's jerseys and a used car for that kind of money. It's funny because while I don't think that's worth 50 million dollars, there's a good chance that I can appreciate the artistic value it does have much more than someone who is willing to pay 50 mil for it. I know this isn't him, but I love Rothko's work, and this is certainly evocative of his that.  I wonder how much the Mona Lisa would go at auction for (and if there is any paintings worth more). Last Supper is the only thing I can think of  Mona Lisa might be worth more out of sheer notoriety, although I agree the Last Supper *should* be worth more.  If it was laundered to buy all the cheetas and have a sweet cheetah army guarding his compound I’d be okay with it. However i doubt this is the case. How exactly do you launder money like this  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/arts/design/has-the-art-market-become-an-unwitting-partner-in-crime.html   http://www.hopesandfears.com/hopes/culture/art/214699-guide-to-laundering-money-art  https://www.quora.com/How-does-one-launder-money-using-art-work The NYT is being pretty charitable with that 'unwitting'.  Most of the time, there is full awareness. Saudi Princes do not need to money launder.  Their bank is underground... It's the last da Vinci painting in the open market. Once art goes to the public (i.e., museums), it rarely ever goes back into private ownership. For the ridiculously wealthy, that matters.   Ever been to a museum and noticed little blurbs in the descriptions next to art that states something along the lines of bequeathed or donated by random person? Those random people left art to the public upon their deaths. (and occasionally in the UK, to pay taxes.) The new approach is to hang privately-owned works in public spaces to increase their value. A priceless Da Vinci painting. You all do realize those aren't cheap at all right? The list of people that could do this is so exceedingly small that it couldn't have been that big a mystery. Obviously when you get to the S for Saud part it gets a little tricky but really, those cats need to fund their tyrannical and terroristic whims some how.  Some context:  &gt; Over the last 25 years, I've been amazed at the rise in prices and the sheer volume of the art market. **100 million dollars** for a Picasso removes the work from public currency. It says, "Look, I can only belong to the super rich." And all other Picasso's are just the same. This alienation of the work from the common viewer is actually a form of spiritual vandalism -- a cultural obscenity.  Robert Hughes, *The New Shock the New*, 2004  I would strongly recommend the above documentary (a follow-up to Hughes' wonderful series on 20th century art, *The Shock of the New*) and *The Mona Lisa Curse* (2008) which expands on the problems of the 21st century art market. Probably looking for TP for his Bunghole. Jesus christ. I am in Canada living off of 438 dollars for the month, payed my rent and had 38 bucks (gone now, have to buy food), while this guy just plays with hundreds of millions. (I am being penalized for working the previous month, there is no way I could stretch out 1000$ from the beginning of novemeber to the end of december, well, 1438 if u want to include my december check, anyway).   Yay Canada.  How much of your income goes to taxes  300 million or so For his room in prison or maybe to buy his freedom  Knew it before it hit media. No surprise.  No you didn't You’re out of bounds. I did. Now thanks but leave me alone. You’re out of bounds. I did. Now thanks but leave me alone. You’re out of bounds. I did. Now thanks but leave me alone. You’re out of bounds. I did. Now thanks but leave me alone.  You’re out of bounds. I did. Now thanks but leave me alone.  You’re out of bounds. I did. Now thanks but leave me alone.  ITT: Americans pissed off they no longer lead the world in financial excess. Oh fuck, you're an asshole who shows up in every thread. We never did. You might want to look up Soviet excesses.

 Those Panama Papers are so damning, and not a ripple in the world. Its hard for us to be shocked anymore So? Did anything come out of the exposure of Panama Papers? Was her death all in vain?   Edit: Assumed people's gender incorrectly. I'm a local. The sort of people who have been charged with her murder are more likely to be drug/oil/fuel/human smugglers and traffickers than Panama-sort tax evaders.  I mean, you wouldn't expect Panama-sort tax evaders to do their own dirty work, would you? Agreed. However they would not use a disorganised gang in Marsa which leaves telecom records everywhere, either.  Edit: Marsa being a notorious harbour town where criminals seemingly started aggregating.  Maybe the contractor hired subcontractors?  The media today reported that these guys used their personal mobile phone to top up the "anonymous" phone they used to send the sms that triggered the bomb from... To think that we lost our greatest journalist due to the actions of someone like that is so infuriating It was She not he . Yes and no, the story didn’t get much traction from the MSM, especially because it didn’t have anything to do with Trump. Sad. &gt; especially because it didn’t have anything to do with Trump. Sad.  you could search "panama papers trump" into any search engine and find out that is a lie.  why do people enjoy lying so blatantly and proudly?  Are you sure you’re not talking about the Paradise papers?  If you’re going to be a pedant and take jokes seriously, at least be right. http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trumps-first-appearance-panama-papers-uncovered-722266  Seems like this is changing as the Panama Papers continue to be dissected. Doesn't it physically hurt to have to lie so blatantly?  Did it get alot of mainstream media attention? Or did it have something to do with Trump? I fail to see the lie, educate me. It got plenty of mainstream media attention. You can just do a quick google search for "panama papers" and see articles from last year talking in detail about the scandal from places like NYTimes, NBC News, Wired, The Atlantic, The Guardian, USA Today...  I could probably just pick a "MSM" company at random and find an article they wrote about it.  So...yes, the line about "the story didn’t get much traction from the MSM" is clearly a lie. In comparison to other leaks of the magnitude, it was lackluster, especially it’s lack of staying power in the cultural zeitgeist  But If you want to be pedantic because I made a flipant joke about how self centered and narrow minded the MSM is, I’ll concede that journalists did talk about it. It likely didn't blow up because there weren't any specific crazy revelations about US citizens, at least from everything I have read. Some that were in there were already convicted of fraud, so there wasn't a lot to latch onto over the long term. "Known fraudsters show up in leak around shady business practices" isn't exactly a headline that's going to grab people for weeks on end.  Edit: Not to mention, showing up in the leaks doesn't mean you did anything that is actually illegal or even unethical. You are absolutely right. Which is why I answered yes and no to the original question, and joked about how it had nothing to do with trump aka american news. Does that make sense now?
 A 17 foot snake. That's just not right. All total they caught nealy 1 mile of snake (5000').        Creepy shivers me... You want shivers? Imagine how many miles of snake they didn't catch.  Now go lay on the grass and take a nap. There are bigger snakes out there. Are we in any danger, due to climate change, of a snakenado ? Florida has been for a while thanks to people dumping pet pythons and the state being a utopia for them despite them being an unnatural species to the area.  Snakenado is pretty much an inevitably should a water spout happen. Anacondas are in North America now.  http://www.slate.com/blogs/wild_things/2013/11/15/green_anacondas_in_the_everglades_the_largest_snake_in_the_world_has_invaded.html &gt; Anacondas are in North America now.  Yeah, the doctor that delivered me said the same thing right after telling my mother that I was a boy. 'Snakenado' kind of happened already since this whole issue dates back to Hurricane Andrew wiping out a reptile breeding facility. Snakerricanes are different That's one big fucking Nope Rope.  Terrifying. 17 feet of Danger Noodle Danger noodle stealing that for my shitty garage band name and self titled debut album. The problem isn't so much that pythons in the everglades are invasive,  idiots have put different species there before.  The problem is that they may become dominant.  Right now, the natural dominant species is the American Alligator, and there are plenty of documented cases of pythons eating them.   Fuck those snakes. Alligators are people food! I once saw a video of an alligator killing a python by clawing its way out of the snake, after being swallowed.  Seems like a pretty even dual for apex predator spot.    Maybe at a point if the python populations keeps growing, they will impact the alligator population by eating too many of them ... but at this point the alligator population has grown (recovered) to the point that hunts are being authorized to reduce it. Thats where she went... florida. The same guy got a bigger one in 2013, 18'8". &gt;“Usually, the hunters will then take the snakes and make products with their skin. The snakes are not considered a food source because they contain high levels of mercury,”  Where’s the mercury coming from? Aquatic Cycling of Mercury in the Everglades  https://sofia.usgs.gov/projects/index.php?project_url=evergl_merc and I need me a new pair of cowboy boots!

Longest time juggling while walking backwards?  Most consecutive three pointers while blindfolded? It almost held the record for lamest comment, but you beat it to the mark.
 Let's build houses out of flammable materials in wildfire zones. By the time they burn, we'll have already sold them. If the legislature tries to regulate us, we'll just pay them off. It's win win. Try not coming up with nonsense gas formulas only for California  The only thing better than them having to pay high gas prices is the upcoming federal tax law where the state taxes fuck over the state homeowners  Tough luck. Get what you vote for Californians I see a few salty downvotes.. people don't like the truth  Yeah, because gas prices in California have a lot to do with the fire in Ventura county. Because state propositions affect federal tax laws.../s  This guy is kinda off topic and also wrong. Taxes in California have nothing to do with price gouging, and gas prices in state are not high either...  People don't want to know the truth when they have something to defend. The only thing people can defend in this context is tax increasion, which doesn't take a genius to realize would increase prices. Price gouging actually serves a legitimate economic purpose. Politicians don’t math.   [High prices incentivize consumers to purchase only what they need to satisfy their highest-valued wants, and leave the rest for others.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adammillsap/2017/09/07/price-gouging-laws-not-hurricanes-empty-stores-shelves/)  I'm not seeing any math.  &gt; While the intention is admirable, the reality is that instead of plentiful supplies at low prices, these laws give us long lines and empty shelves.  1. They actually have the nerve to suggest that avoiding a long line is a valid reason to condemn the lower class to death and 2. empty shelves is an indicator that people are getting what they need, you dumb asshole.  &gt; The absence of any specific definition of gouging likely discourages any price increases,   Because the vaguest laws are those least exploited. Has this been true, in your experience? In anyone's?  &gt; It’s not clear that raising the price by such a modest amount to increase the likelihood water would be there for the people who needed it deserved the label “price gouging” and the scorn that accompanies it.  Fucking hell. Think about what they're saying when they say "people who needed it." Did the poor people who could afford the water not NEED it? Of course they did. What they mean is "people who could afford the marked up price." This scheme is a cold, calculated extraction of capital that dooms the poorest of us - the weakest of us - to a new tier of misery, if not death. There is literally no altruism involved.  &gt; (dumb as shit paragraph about how you can complain about price gouging via their tip line or social media, as if that's a valid, immediate way to combat it)  That's right. It's on *you* to keep these guys in check. It's your responsibility.  &gt; If water is $1.79 per bottle instead of $0.50, it might not make sense to use it for trivial things, like watering your Bernie Sanders Chia Pet.  The actual "trivial things" they're referring to - and those most affected by this twisted rationale - are "everyone below the poverty line."  &gt; Meanwhile, high prices incentivize producers to increase supply.  Funny, I always thought demand did that.  &gt; Moreover, while price-gouging laws keep prices down, it’s not clear they reduce costs.  Literally no citation or proof to the contrary given. Just doubt. You seem extremely confused, but I love your enthusiasm! I believe I've found a new go-to phrase! Honestly, in my view, the market should decide. If it's priced too high it won't sell. It can only be priced as high as it's worth to consumers.  It should not only be legal, but encouraged. Consumers should spend money it's better for the economy, but most importantly the better for me. Mua hahah muahahahahha. Unpopular position - I'm ok with price gouging during disasters.  I think it is a good and natural thing.  Here's why.  It is a matter of economics and maximizing the benefit to society.  When demand sky rockets because a hurricane is coming, prices naturally go up.  Those who did not plan ahead, buying plywood before the emergency, will pay more now, and that willingness to pay (demand) drives up the price equilibrium point.  This is normal, and it has a positive consequence.   The higher price means that sellers are motivated to increase supply (for profit).  They can pay extra to have more of the goods shipped in, despite the additional cost, and still be profitable ... and they will do so for profit.  Now trucks of [whatever - plywood, water, batteries] stream into the state, warehouses in other states are emptied, maybe product is flown in ... and more people get the product than would have gotten it had the price been artificially kept down.  More water/plywood/batteries = lives saved.    You have to remember that even in gouging, the transactions are voluntary.  Each party to the transaction is making a judgment that at the given (high) price, they want to make the trade.  Anti-gouging laws take away freedom of both parties ... including the freedom of the buyer to pay what they would pay for the product.  If I failed to plan ahead and was faced with a choice of paying $10 a bottle for water, or not getting water (because it would be sold out), I would be very unhappy with a law that values my dollars above my well being.  Shouldn't I be allowed to decide what is more important - the dollars in my wallet, or water in my family's mouths?  In other words, I can decide for myself if the price is worth it, better than a government deciding for me.  And by letting the market (the people collectively) set its own price, overall benefit is maximized.  We have anti-gouging laws because (1) people don't understand economics; and (2) politicians can score points pretending to care about the little guy.  It is dump policy.  Sorry for the rant -
 &gt;Smirnoff Ice vodka bottles  Is that a new flavor? How does the author not know what Smirnoff Ice is? Its what all the cool kids drink!   &gt;shows a team member with a drawing of a penis and the word "Oedipus" on his bare back, as an onlooker points and laughs.  At this point I am calling it: The university needs to fuck off.   &gt;Team members also told the school paper that they were made to drink mixtures of Tabasco sauce and vodka  Oh the horror!  Hazing?! At a university!? What is this world coming to!? Next you're going to tell me college students get drunk every weekend. It would help if actual hazing was involved. I get the emotional trauma of being forced to drink smirnoff ice is overwhelming and all but the university needs to fuck off.  I've been "iced" before and I'm still trying to get over the agonizing chest pain from all the gas it gave me. *‘smashing Smirnoff Ice vodka bottles against a statue of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius’ ‘Team members also told the school paper that they were made to drink mixtures of Tabasco sauce and vodka'*  WHOA let's shut this place down it's out of control!
 Excuse me. Grey Cup winning quarterback Warren Moon, thankyouverymuch.  If these allegations are true, then they're really really bad. See this is an allegation that doesn't really bother me too much. Maybe I'm just over the Moon.
 At what point does the rest of the world say fuck the US and does their own thing while the US sinks into its worst depression ever?     When their wood stops being so soft XD When they can take on Russia and china, i.e never. We run this shit. We have to cut back on Canadian lumber imports to make room for more Russian lumber imports, which have increased 42% this year.   This is pretty much it.  Decreasing Canadian softwood doesn't create an increase in US softwood production; it just shifts the imports elsewhere -- in this case, Russia.  Tough for the US trade body; the WTO and various other official organizations already ruled that there's nothing wrong with how Canada manages softwood lumber.  For those not in the know, in Canada, most of the coniferous forest is owned by the country as a whole, not by private enterprise.  The country then leases out plots of land to private industry for managed logging.  US politicians/trade interests look at this and cry "unfair!" because in the US, property is almost all held privately, and this increases all the costs involved in managing the resource.  NAFTA basically did a tit-for-tat agreement, where some industries (like steel) ended up going mostly to the US, and other industries (like softwood lumber) ended up going mostly to Canada.  Now that NAFTA's up for renegotiation/the scrap heap, all the lobbyists are coming out of the woodwork to bring up the old arguments to pull ALL of the industries back inside the US, ignoring the fact that this will cause massive ripple effects in other parts of the economy. Russian lumber which uses a lot of North Korean labor, essentially in slavery conditions.
 from an american, I say to you man, good job. you can rest now. if you wish to continue, do so. you've earned your wings my friend (not actually a friend, it's just a phrase... you get it) Omar's story needs to be made more public. The word hero is do overused but it's definitely applicable to him. I hope he's one day able to return to Mosul and teach young Iraqis of all faiths in the schools there. He's an amazing role model for patriotism and courage. Holy shit that was an unimaginable burden to bear. :( Did he hack their bitcoin account?  Did you read the article? What do you think this is? No one reads articles here.  What article? I didn’t réalisé you can click on it and read 
 There (in 1F.) was no atmospherical Release of Radioactivity since the Unit 3 Cleaning Operation of the Top Floor in afair 2013/14  So they, JA, need to check less because we know now which Fields are bad, not so bad and free of Contamination   All agricultural Products for the Export still get checked with a Zero Tolerance Policy (no detectable Levels/ Kg.)
 my god just launch a missile and stop talking Wouldn't you rather see two obese, belligerent nutcases with bad tailors and really lousy haircuts fight it out in an octagon at PyeongChang?  I mean, they could even sell tickets for charity or something.  Two men enter!  Neither leave! That would be the ideal outcome. I would pay good money to watch that.  It could be the best slap fight of all time! Trump's ground game weak AF. Kim's gonna break his wobbly ass ankles. Saying "War is Inevitable" is not news. It's our thing. Three things we learned pretty early on; Leopards eat people, sometimes the people sitting right next to you. Don't shit uphill and three, Fuck that other tribe. Those fucking Fuckers.  News would be if Kim Jong Un, (who has been to school in the West and knows his whole shtick is bs) picked up the phone and said, "Hey, uh, we could be doing a lot better here and I'd like to start turning this ship. Gonna need some humanitarian aid. I'll stay on but only to help it go well."  Pretty sure the upper elite are so invested in the status quo that he would get a bullet to the head before the phone hit the craddle Boom he’s replaced.  In order news, After reading the latest about the war games on CNN Kim Jong Un stormed off to his bedroom, violently raped one of his blow-up dolls and then ate a bucket of KFC...  You shouldn't call his  slaves blow-up dolls.  I'm sure he shoots some of them too. and sends 3 generations of their blow-up doll family to re-education camps :-)  He does have a beautiful wife... .... but she's a tad over inflated.. gotta open the valve for a few seconds.  there’s not KFC at North Korea He just has to tell any food outlet "you KFC, now make me feied battered chicken bucket" and it's a KFC. If they don't do it... them and 3 generations of their family are fucked. There's a KFC in NK.  A war with North Korea would be laughably one sided.  Even if North korea invaded South Korea, they can't use the border, because mines, so they would have to use aircraft or a navy to deploy troops, which could easily be intercepted by the South Koreans.  Also, their weapons are outdated, soviet era machines, which is no match for modern technology.  Their navy may be big, but their navy is also shit. mostly comprising corvettes, the only advantage they have are submarines, they have something like a few hundred.  The North Koreans, like the Japanese, would never be able to reach the US mainland, and since there are about 3 aircraft carriers with the 5th fleet, the surface vessels of NK navy would get obliterated by bombers long before they could reach them.  NK nukes are not viable, despite their 'tests'.  Also, alot of soldiers would defect to the south. damn it triple h...you just had to make nxt takeover wargames... If Jelloface really wants it....there's no point in waiting.  Which jelloface are you talking about, please be specific. Hundreds of thousands of deaths should be avoided at all costs. Even at the cost of millions of deaths? This is the biggest thing. The Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings prevented millions more deaths. It's an extremely harsh reality and obviously it's easy for me to sit here and say, but it's the truth. It would be in the tens of millions. But yes, I agree.  Sometimes you need to break some eggs to make an omelette They sell eggs in a carton...so there's that option. Even better Orange jelloface will get millions of Koreans killed just to boost his ratings. Well, not just to boost his ratings. I am sure he and his cronies have figured out a way to personally profit off the war in Korea.  He probably won't start the was UNTIL him &amp; cronies figure out how to personally profit. War is great business, so starting one should only be done once you get the Pentagon contracts for boots , MREs, bedsheets, canteens, etc...  Wait, so I just noticed. It's okay to demean this President based on his appearance? Can I do it for the last one? Obama looked like a [comment deleted, no racial comments allowed per subreddit rules] Yes it is ok to demean this president and everyone one else - this president has taught us that (or did you have your head in the sand for the past year?).  Sorry NK, we just cut programs for veterans. We're going to have to postpone this one president.
 I'm pretty surprised here, I think the stat was over 90% of the time a Grand Jury won't indict a cop. Must have some good hard evidence in this case. Let's hope it does well against a jury of this cops peers.  Mmmmm.... mesquite officer..... As if a member of the Mesquite Mafia is ever going to get convicted.
